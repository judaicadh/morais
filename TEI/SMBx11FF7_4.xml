            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Kind friends&#33;  Let your tears flow copiously at this sad<lb/> hour.  It is due to the family of the lately lamented<lb/> Josep and now greatly sorrowed for Clara Asch&#44; that they we<lb/> should feel show them how deep is the sympathy which their<lb/> bereavements excite in our breasts.  True&#44; no pangs<lb/> can equal those which they experience&#44; who have drunk<lb/> a full cup of domestic afflictions.  They naturally<lb/> are disconsolate&#44; whose losses comprise even that of so<lb/> excellent a mother.  But we all&#45;&#45;irrespective of our<lb/> congregational preferences&#45;&#45;must needs be sensible of the<lb/> void created in the household of Israel.  &#34;The depar&#45;<lb/>&#45;ture of the righteous&#34; write our Sages&#44; &#34;is ominous to the<lb/> world.&#34;  In this age of general apathy for the<lb/> ordinances of yore&#44; we may well weep for her who lies<lb/> lifeless in this coffin.  For&#44; she had cast her lot among<lb/> the faithful.  Like her sainted husband&#44; she belonged<lb/> to that band of staunch adherents of the law&#44; who waver<lb/> not&#44; nor flinch.  A thousand might fall on her<lb/> side victims to the onslaughts of infidelity&#44; tens of thousands<lb/> might <sic>yeild</sic> to the attacks of incredulity&#44; but she surrendered<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>not her principles.  Is not the number of her<lb/> compeers fast diminishing&#63;  Aye&#58; a lad might now<lb/> count those who without carping at the laws of Moses&#44;<lb/> and caviling at Rabbinical institutions&#44; follow the ances&#45;<lb/>&#45;tral faith with simplicity of heart.  Fast decreasing<lb/> is the number of mothers&#44; who deem it a privilege to<lb/> rear their offspring in the fear of God&#59; who&#44; like our<lb/> lamented friend&#44; enforce the observance of the Sabbath<lb/> day and of the festivals of the dietary laws and all<lb/> precepts of Judaism.  It behooves us then to<lb/> bemoan the loss sustained by a community&#44; not less than by<lb/> this family&#59; for&#44; she who was its ornament&#44; exemplified<lb/> in her conduct the religion of Sinai.<lb/></p>
            <p>Would that the tears of sympathy now shed&#44; <sic>yeilded</sic><lb/> abundance of comfort to those who most intensely bewail<lb/> and mourn.  Fain would we console with words<lb/> those who have been so repeatedly and so severely<lb/> tried.  But will we attain that end by imparting lessons<lb/> of a <sic>stoick</sic> philosophy&#63;  Shall we say that we<lb/> must bear with patience the misfortunes we cannot<lb/> avert&#63;  Shall we tell the afflicted&#44; that it is of no<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>conceivable advantage to grieve over circumstances<lb/> beyond our control&#63;  Shall we intimate that it is<lb/> unwise and futile to lament a life that cannot be<lb/> recovered&#63;  No&#44; when the heart bleeds&#44; stronger appliances<lb/> must be resorted to in order to effect a cure.<lb/></p>
            <p>Come then O daughter of heaven&#33;  Come then holy religion&#33;<lb/> and pour thy balmy unction over wounds which are fresh<lb/> and deep.  Comfort thou the children of my deceased<lb/> friends.  Tell them that death is not <sic>annhilation</sic>&#44; for<lb/> God will not destroy the work of His hand&#45;&#45;but it is the<lb/> opening of a brighter existence&#44; where our mental and<lb/> spiritual faculties are heightened and amplified.<lb/>  Tell them that the last farewell on earth&#44; is a farewell of promise to become reunited&#44; where <sic>seperation</sic> can<lb/> nevermore take place.  Tell them that the dear<lb/> objects&#44; now enshrouded from their vision&#44; live together&#44;<lb/> and enjoy the fruits of their righteousness.  Tell them<lb/> that she who has just leaped the shores of eternity&#44; reached<lb/> a haven of rest&#44; and is surrounded by beings whom she<lb/> fondly loved on this side of the grave.  That she bids<lb/> them be comforted&#44; and cling together with unswerving<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>affection&#44; aiding each other in the performance<lb/> of the duties of life.  Yes&#44; my friends&#44; sons and<lb/> daughters of Joseph and Clara Asch.  Could the lips<lb/> now sealed in death&#44; move at this hour&#44; they would<lb/> offer that oft&#45;repeated counsel.  Religion and morality<lb/> would they commend as the means of salvation.<lb/>  Follow that standard.  Follow it that you may<lb/> bear the consciousness of your integrity.  Follow it&#44;<lb/> that you may become a blessing to the inhabitants of<lb/> this nether world.  Follow it&#44; and you will enhance<lb/> the bliss of parents&#44; so good and so virtuous&#44; as those whose<lb/> departure we jointly deplore for your sake and that of the<lb/> household of Israel.<lb/></p>
