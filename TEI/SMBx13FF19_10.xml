            <p>About Sewing &#38; Industrial schools.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Brethren.  Several years ago a report was<lb/> circulated&#44; injurious to the character of some among<lb/> our coreligionists&#44; who live in the Southern portions section of<lb/> Philadelphia spread abroad.  Mission schools&#44; in the interest of the<lb/> Christian Nazarene population&#44; had been opened in said<lb/> locality.  To righ that no right&#45;thinking Israelite could<lb/> possibly object.  For just as we should be always anxious<lb/> to bring the restraining influences of our religion to bear<lb/> on the conduct of our little ones&#44; so must good people<lb/> of another religion feel a strong wish that their boys<lb/> and girls be not allowed to grow without a wholesome<lb/> check upon low rising passions.  But at the same time that<lb/> a sensible Jew will praise every effort endeavour looking to the im&#45;<lb/>&#45;provement of morals&#44; in those whom destitution or parental<lb/> neglect exposes to vicious surroundings&#44; he must con&#45;<lb/>&#45;demn resist any attempt to tamper with his own creed sacred belief.<lb/>  The current report was that a number of Hebrew fa&#45;<lb/>&#45;milies were periodically visited by persons in the pay<lb/> of the Church&#59; that they were furnished with tracts and copies of the new<lb/> Testaments&#44; and encouraged urged to send their children<lb/> to mission schools.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>The bait held out for the unwary was a promise of garments&#44;<lb/> and&#44; during the December and January festivities in Christen&#45;<lb/>&#45;dom&#44; sweets and refreshments. and sweets.  With a sense<lb/> of deep humiliation I acknowledge that I heard of fa&#45;<lb/>&#45;thers and mothers among my our people&#44; who were weak<lb/> or wicked enough to endanger their sons and daughters&#39;<lb/> future peace of mind&#44; for the sake of the presents received.<lb/>  I condemned referred to their action in denunciatory terms from this pulpit&#44; and I<lb/> had enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing that the evil was<lb/> soon counteracted.  A Jewish Sewing School<lb/> was planted in the very neighborhood where<lb/> missionaries worked for conversions.  The attendance<lb/> on Sundays afternoon continued to be quite large&#44; except at one<lb/> season&#44; when a contagious prevailing disease became severe in conta&#45;<lb/>&#45;gious in that section of our city.  Many Various were<lb/> the inducements which took our children to the new<lb/> institution.  There was the the pleasant singing entirely<lb/> Jewish&#44; the facility to learn how to ply the needle&#44;<lb/> the assurance that the clothes once made&#44; would be<lb/> given to the diligent little seamstresses.  A great attraction<lb/> was also the corps of teachers&#44; whose kindness won<lb/> the affection of their pupils young pupils.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>But the strongest&#44; yet the gentlest&#44; influence was<lb/> exercised by the superintendent.  I am glad<lb/> that I cannot give room to misapprehensions&#44; when<lb/> I say that she was worthy of conducting a school&#44;<lb/> bearing the name of Rebecca Gratz.  For with<lb/> the a considerable degree of that dignity which was natural to our distinguished deceased sister in faith&#44;<lb/>&#45;&#45;who commanded respect by her venerably imposing looks&#45;&#45;the<lb/> Directress of the 10th &#38; South sts Sewing School possessed<lb/> also in a high degree the capacity to draw to herself<lb/> the hearts of the youthful attendants&#44; and to secure<lb/> their good dem behaviour by mild persuasion. mildness<lb/> But now in justice to her health&#59; which is un&#45;<lb/>&#45;questionably an object of primary consideration in every <lb/>body person&#44; she must quit or suspend at all events her labors exertions.<lb/>  I am informed that none has volunteered to supply<lb/> her vacancy.  Surely&#44; in a population&#44; said to be<lb/> over ten thousand&#44; or two thousand families&#44; there must<lb/> be exist one Jewess of leisure&#44; endowed with the proper<lb/> qualifications for governing a sewing school with<lb/> the characteristic abilities displayed by the last<lb/> superintendent.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>The necessity for such a one is felt no less now<lb/> than seven or eight years ago.  The locality remains<lb/> as heretofore.  It is thickly inhabited by members of<lb/> our race&#44; and the perils which the latter encounter<lb/> of being weaned away from Judaism&#44; have not been<lb/> removed.  Far be it from do not me to underrate the<lb/> importance of the two forenoon Sunday Schools.  as They are counteragents&#44;<lb/> but the condition features attending the Sewing Schools<lb/> make give them of particular value.  For the sake<lb/> good name connected To my exceeding regret the news<lb/> has gone forth that also the other also set up in the<lb/> Northern section of our city&#44; and lately holding its sessions in the commodious<lb/> building of owned by Hebrew Education Society&#44; Schools&#44; will<lb/> not be resumed.  For the sake honor of the good<lb/> name connected with it&#44; that of Louisa B. Hart still<lb/>fresh in the memory of this congregation&#44; I hope<lb/> that the rumor is false.  It would be out<lb/> of all reason to ask that a person coming from<lb/> a great distance to teach during the morning&#44; should<lb/> assume the heavier task of preparing the work<lb/> and managing a whole school in the afternoon.<lb/></p>

            <p>As an colaborer supervising appointed watchman in the field of the Jewish religion&#44;<lb/> I cannot suggest exact a rigorous service.  I ought<lb/> to be&#44; and I am&#44; satisfied&#44; if each labour lays hold<lb/> of the spade implement to work and bring out goodly fruits<lb/> as much far as natural powers talents and strength will allow.  But<lb/> without confining ourselves to my Congregation&#44; women<lb/> of Israel ought to be found&#44; if sought after&#44; who<lb/> have sufficient time at their command&#44; and the<lb/> energy&#44; perseverance and temperament necessary needful<lb/> for governing with success our two sewing schools.<lb/>  It is but little merit to have advocated the form&#45;<lb/>&#45;ation of a third&#44; still&#44; I feel pleasure in claiming<lb/> it for this pulpit.  When the Wane st<lb/> School was established in Port Richmond&#44; an fellow<lb/> Israelite whose steady efforts chiefly aim at the pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;servation of the Hebrew Knowledge among amidst the young<lb/> of our people&#44; deemed it advisable to benefit the<lb/> Jewish cause otherwise a class standing immensely supremely in<lb/> need of refining influences.  He conceived the idea of<lb/> bringing about a salutary intercourse between our<lb/> sisters in faith &#34;to the manner born&#44;&#34; and the young the youthful<lb/> daughters of foreigners&#44; unused to our language and our habits.<lb/></p>

            <p>I spoke of it here in our Sanctuary&#44; and a Jewess within hearing of my<lb/> voice now residing elsewhere&#44; but well qualified for the task undertook it the task at once&#44; and gave abandoned relinquishing it up only<lb/> when her health became unequal to it.  I am<lb/> grateful to her successors&#44; for to journey raise the lowly in their own estimation by a friendly contest&#44; is in my mind wor&#45;<lb/>&#45;ship to our Common Father.  When I consider<lb/> how much the divinely favored owe in Israel owe their brothers<lb/> and sisters&#44; who have been denied the advantages we<lb/> enjoy&#44; and how comparatively little is comparatively done for their<lb/> future lasting welfare&#44; I bless the least exertions tending to looking unto<lb/> that end.  Still&#44; the more I think&#44; the deeper be&#45; my personal experience and the mature judgment of friends others have pro<lb/>&#45;come my conviction &#45;foundly convinced me&#44; that permanent benefits to the off&#45;<lb/>spring of the poor&#44; will best alone flow from instruction in ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;nual labor.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;  More than the needle woman we require the journeyman.  To tear them our brethren away from the avenues<lb/> to which all have resorted&#44;&#45;&#45;peddling as a stepping stone<lb/> to store keeping&#45;&#45;&#44; industrial schools must be planted in<lb/> our institutions.  The brush and the compass&#44; and the brush&#44; the the chisel and ham&#45;<lb/>&#45;mer and the chisel must take the place of the basket<lb/> and the yard measure stick.  We must foster a taste<lb/> for works in which our forefathers excelled&#44; until a cruel<lb/> world compelled us to abandon forsake them in self&#45;protection&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>when it we were constrained as to bend our minds on wholly upon the acquisition amassing of gold&#44; which<lb/> we might with ease carry along with ease in exile&#44; or purchase<lb/> therewith an uncertain existence among inimical nations.<lb/>  Would that our Foster&#45;Home had been early alive to<lb/> this imperative want.  We might now point with<lb/> pride to our skilful mechanics and builders&#44; and have<lb/> thus rolled away the charge&#44; unsupported by history&#44;<lb/> that Jews seek only professions of self advantage&#44;<lb/> but not of universal utility.  The ambition<lb/> to rule in the forge and laboratory rather than in the counter&#44;<lb/> might have enkindled in our children the inventive<lb/> genius&#44; which has set on this land a peerless<lb/> crown of glory.  It is not any too late<lb/> for the above institution and others kindred establishments to act wisely&#44; and<lb/> bestow large means upon that which will eventually<lb/> save thousands to our Charities&#44; a while it will<lb/> exalt our the Hebrew communities.<lb/></p>

We do not need<lb/> travel beyond our city limits to acquaint ourselves<lb/> with a system&#44; which must sooner or later be<lb/> introduced in our midst&#44; to prevent pauperism and<lb/> shame.  A short ride or a walk can afford us<lb/> that knowledge.  Brethren.  Whoever will undertake to<lb/> inquire&#44; and study the plan&#44; to work for and<lb/> agitate its adoption&#44; will have deserved well of<lb/> Judaism&#44; and gained a title to the gratitude to<lb/> of generations unborn.<lb/></p>
