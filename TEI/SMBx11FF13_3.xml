            <p>138</p>
            <p>On the death of Dr Abraham De Sola<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren.  The occasion is extraordinary enough to<lb/> induce me to speak at some length&#44; but I shall not<lb/> follow my inclination.  I supposed it last Sab&#45;<lb/>&#45;bath&#44; when I instinctively felt that the man who<lb/> had given a large share of his life and of his blood<lb/> towards the creation of a united country&#45;&#45;and that my<lb/> own native land&#45;&#45;ought to have drawn from my lips a<lb/> eulogy.  And glowingly would I have pronounced it<lb/> in this house of our God.  For notwithstanding his<lb/> faults&#45;&#45;and they proceeded from the judgment rather than<lb/> from the will&#45;&#45;I recognize in Joseph Garibaldi a<lb/> man hero&#44; whom the Creating Being we worship adore&#44; designedly<lb/> raised as an instrument of His beneficent decree.<lb/></p>
            <p>This week also I shall refrain from speaking&#44; as<lb/> a still alter even would call for.  The death<lb/> of one&#44; not so universally renowned as the Italian patriot<lb/> to whom I have just referred&#44; but widely and deserved&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly esteemed among English&#45;speaking Israelites&#44; should<lb/> elicit words of regret.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Here especially those words would be fitting&#44;<lb/> for a multiplicity of reasons.  We worship<lb/> according to the Sephardic ritual&#44; remain&#44; in<lb/> Synagogue matters at least&#44; conservative in our<lb/> views&#44; and are instructed in our religious duties<lb/> in the vernacular tongue.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Reverend Dr Abraham De Sola who breathed<lb/> his last on Monday night was reared in our Min&#45;<lb/>&#45;hag&#59; he officiated&#44; agreeably to the same&#44; for<lb/> the period of thirty five years&#59; expounded the<lb/> Law&#44; pursuant to ancestral traditions&#44; and did so<lb/> in the language employed here on the pulpit.<lb/>  It may not even be impossible that some of my<lb/> audience may have heard his preaching in the<lb/> old Synagogue&#44; before my arrival in this city.<lb/>  How very becoming then that one who had so<lb/> much in common with us should receive in<lb/> our midst a meed of praise.  Yet&#44; another con&#45;<lb/>sideration is to be urged.  Our departed coreligionist<lb/> made himself felt in the world of letters as a<lb/> scholar&#44; able to represent his faith with honor.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>He however socially occupied a high position&#44; and in<lb/> latter years furthered and extended the publi&#45;<lb/>&#45;cation of devotional and instructive books for the<lb/> use of our people.<lb/></p>
            <p>Still&#44; I check my desire to pronounce a panegy&#45;<lb/>&#45;ric&#44; and will not detain you on a warm sum&#45;<lb/>&#45;mer morning.  Besides&#58; the personal and literary merits of the Reverend<lb/> Dr Abraham De Sola will undoubtedly form the<lb/> subject of public encomium in the place where<lb/> he lived long and worked steadily.  They will<lb/> be rehearsed also in England where he was born<lb/> and educated for the ministry.  They will be<lb/> widely published in the Jewish and secular press.<lb/>  There each of my brethren who feels an interest<lb/> in the history of his distinguished fellow&#45;believers&#44;<lb/> will read more than I could might say and better than<lb/> the poverty of my language could say it.<lb/>  I shall therefore simply ask that you will<lb/> join me in offering the customary prayer for<lb/> the glory of a notable member of our race&#44; who has been<lb/> summoned to His Maker&#44; and respond Amen to<lb/> the wish that Abraham De Sola may not have<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>gone hence without leaving behind some to take<lb/> up the sword with which he fought for his&#45;<lb/>&#45;torical Judaism.  Then will he rejoice<lb/> in heaven at the perpetuation of his guiding<lb/> principles&#44; and we shall be preserved on<lb/> earth as a distinctly monotheistic and morally<lb/> elevated people.<lb/>  &#40;It was enlarged and embellished in the delivery&#41;<lb/></p>
