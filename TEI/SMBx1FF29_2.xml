            <p>New York January 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 5630<lb/>
            Rev S Morais<lb/>
            Respected Friend.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have delayed writing to<lb/> thank you for your ready response to my request until<lb/> I could give you some account as to the result of the<lb/> contest.  Now let me say that I am exceedingly obliged<lb/> to you for the warm espousal of the cause the advocates<lb/> of which I am sorry to say are diminishing in number<lb/> daily more and more.  The Congregation assembled last<lb/> evening to receive the report of their Committee.  I addressed<lb/> the meeting with a view of guiding its deliberations and<lb/> decision on the subject of females in the Choir.  I<lb/> argued to prove it improper by the laws of the Bible<lb/> and the Talmud and by the usage in all properly con&#45;<lb/>ducted Portuguese Congregations as well as on the question<lb/> of expediency&#44; in as much as a choir of men and boys<lb/> are as well adapted for devotional &#38; emotional singing<lb/> as one including females.  I alluded to your letter and<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>and to that Mr De Sola of Montreal to prove the innova&#45;<lb/>tion a dangerous one.  My address elicited the re&#45;<lb/>marks of several.  They do not deny that the laws<lb/> of our sages are against the measure&#44; but insist that<lb/> <hi rend="underline">the spirit of the age</hi> demands their abrogation.<lb/>  After a long and tedious debate of nearly three hours<lb/> the votes were taken and the report was rejected<lb/> by a majority&#44; I am sorry to say&#44; of only 8.  This<lb/> was the first legitimate chance the people had<lb/> to ventilate their ideas on reform and they did<lb/> not let it escape unimproved.  I need scarcely<lb/> say I am nervous and sick in consequence of of the<lb/> excitement last night.  I was bewildered and depressed<lb/> being taken so unawares by men upon whose ad&#45;<lb/>herence to conservation I had relied with every con&#45;<lb/>fidence.  The task will devolve on me to remodel<lb/> and to improve the choir&#44; but I realise fully its dif&#45;<lb/>ficulty.  Knowing as I do how strongly prepos&#45;<lb/>sessed the people are in favor of the sensational<lb/> how can I hope to gain their approval &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> success of the <sic>enterprize</sic> ever so evident.  Excuse<lb/> my annoying you with my troubles&#44; but this<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>being a matter in which we as Portuguese Hazanim<lb/> are equally interested and therefore presuming<lb/> on your sympathy I have given vent to my feelings.<lb/>  Mrs Lyons desires to be kindly remembered<lb/> to Mrs Morais in which I join with best wishes<lb/> for your continued health and happiness&#44; remaining<lb/> with reiterated thanks.<lb/>
            Yours Very Respectfully<lb/></p>
            <p>J J Lyons<lb/></p>
            
            <p>P. S I have just seen our mutual friend<lb/> Mr D Bennmo.&#91;&#63;&#93;  He has received your letter of condolence<lb/> and highly appreciates your expressions of sympa<lb/>thy.  You will be pleased to hear he was elected<lb/> by the Congn. to supply the place in the Board<lb/> of Trustees made vacant by the sad death of his<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93; brother.  It affords me pleasure to add he<lb/> is perfectly &#91;Hebrew&#93; on the question of orthodox&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/></p>
