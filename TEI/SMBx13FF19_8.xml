            <p>A short appeal on behalf of<lb/>
                the U. H. Charities Sunday School<lb/>
                for Sabbath<lb/>
                Kedosheem<lb/></p>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Thou shalt not glean thy vineyard&#44; nor gather every grape<lb/> that drops from thy vineyard&#59; thou shalt leave them<lb/> for the poor and for the stranger.&#34;  This commandment<lb/> given to an agricultural people&#44; may be so rendered interpreted&#44;<lb/> when applied to individuals that follow other pursuits.<lb/>  &#34;Ye shall not live work only for yourselves own advantage&#44; ye shall spare<lb/> some of your earnings for the support of the needy and the wayfarer.&#34;<lb/>  Brethren&#33;  I have been asked to urge you practically<lb/> to show your the observance of that Divine precept.<lb/>  To morrow the2 first anniversary will1 take place be held of a<lb/> society whose establishing in our midst&#44; has proved a<lb/> blessing to deserving indigent&#44; and a credit to our<lb/> community.  Attend the public meeting at the<lb/> Concordia hall&#44; and learn its the workings of that institution.  You will<lb/> then readily inscribe your names among its supporters patrons.<lb/>  For the claims of that charity are such that no Israelite<lb/> can disregard.  It was heretofore a cause<lb/> of regret among the thoughtful Israelites that beneficial<lb/> association often defeated their noble purposes.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Through a defective system in distributing alms&#44; and<lb/> the absence of concerted actions among kindred institutions&#44;<lb/> the idle obtained what is due to the industrious&#59; the<lb/> habitual mendicant drew largely upon as treasury&#44;<lb/> which should have been sep specially set apart for the fortuitously<lb/> poor.  But thanks to the judicious dealing government dispositoins dealing of the associa&#45; society<lb/> &#45;tion&#44; which I am requested to command to your liberality consideration&#44;<lb/> that evil is being fast removed.  It is to me<lb/> a source of unfeigned gratification to know that its searching<lb/> light has at times detected imposture&#44; and exposed it to<lb/> reprobation&#59; while it has discovered the unfort unrevealed misfortune<lb/> and afforded it adequate help.  I gratefully hear<lb/> testimony to the promptitude with which applications<lb/> in behalf of the distressed are attended&#44; and to the<lb/> kindness exercised in order to spare the needy necessitous a blush.<lb/>  In my judgment one year has sufficed to demonstrate<lb/> the possibility of effecting by union a healthful<lb/> reformation in the system of alms&#45;givings.<lb/>  For whereas formerly they who suffered want might<lb/> have been relieved by often disclosing their circumstances to a<lb/> number of public almoners&#44; now they are certain to<lb/> attain their object by having recourse to a single source.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Whereas formerly the succour bestowed was tardy&#44; through by reason of<lb/> the multiplicity of officers and officials to be sought<lb/> after&#44; now promptness characterizes the assistance<lb/> granted.  Whereas formerly facilities for <sic>practising</sic><lb/> deception were given to the sturdy beggars&#44; now that<lb/> the latter are forcibly drawn to a one central point&#44; va&#45;<lb/>&#45;grancy among the Israelites of Philadelphia can and<lb/> must cease.  That successful exertions measures have been<lb/> made taken towards reaching that goal&#44; I may be<lb/> permitted to say without trenching upon the right<lb/> of others by anticipating the report which will be<lb/> submitted to your inspection.  Nor will it be flattering a<lb/> to praise mere allusion to the harmony efficiency &#38; harmony that signalized<lb/> the performance of the holy work&#44; be denied a flattery an undue presence.<lb/>  For even the veteran association&#44; which preferred still to<lb/> continue distinct&#44; has aided the young but vigorous<lb/> association society in its endeavours to root out pauperism inveterate evils.<lb/>  Cognizant of the noble end devised&#44; it has also lent its not withheld the<lb/> cooperation needed for ameliorating the condition of<lb/> the hapless and the afflicted among Hebrews in Israel.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>But the feature of peculiar attractiveness in the or&#45;<lb/>&#45;ganization of &#34;the united Hebrew Charities&#34; is that which<lb/> tends to lessen pauperism.  It has long been the wish ideal<lb/> of the benevolent to imbue the minds of the necessitous<lb/> with the dignity of labor.  To raise them up to their the standard of manhood<lb/> by the thought of inspiring a desire for self&#45;dependence&#59; therefore they did<lb/> earnestly advocate the establishing of a loan&#45;society.<lb/>  If They believed that if conducted with prd prudence and enlightenment sagacity&#44; it<lb/> must prove of incalculable benefit.  Habits of d industry<lb/> must would supersede begger mendicancy&#44; and useful members<lb/> would be added to the Community.  Tomorrow you<lb/> will&#44; my Brethren judge how far those cherished hopes have<lb/> been realized.  When you shall hear of the fresh impetus<lb/> given in various instances to handicraft of the happy results which attended<lb/> an experiment new among us but supremely wise in the bestowing of charity<lb/> you will instinctively feel that the association for which<lb/> I plead has claims has brought them about&#44; has undisputed claims to a portion<lb/> of your <sic>yeilding</sic>; that to it rightly belongs&#44; as to the poor needy<lb/> and the wayfarer in the days of old&#44; what you can spare<lb/> of the substance given you by the Almighty&#59; in other<lb/> words&#44; that to add y all your names to the list of its subscribers<lb/> and donors&#44; is to act up to the spirit of the Divine injunctions&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>But while urging you to directing your benevolence thoughts to an n one<lb/> worthy object worthy of your benevolence&#44; I am reminded of the promise that I would crave<lb/> your cooperation to the promotion furtherance of another.  They who<lb/> hitherto fittingly engaged in that task are the unmarried<lb/> women of our faith&#44; and those will I address.  Sisters&#33;<lb/>  The Sunday&#45;school possesses merits which be cannot be<lb/> undervalued by the thoughtful.  For it is&#44; if I may so<lb/> term it&#44; the a nursery of Jewish feelings.  The amount<lb/> of knowledge imparted ther within its walls is not so<lb/> much to be weighed as the moral influence it exercises.<lb/>  Verily&#44; were it not for its existence many a child of<lb/> our people would have grown in ignorance of his extraction&#44;<lb/> and of the ties which binds him to scattered millions.<lb/>  I am not disposed at present to dwell on the causes which work<lb/></p>

            <p>so injuriously&#59; I will rather allude to that which is<lb/> calculated to counteract the mischief.  In the institution<lb/> I have named&#44; our offspring are taught by the believers<lb/> in one uncreated God.  There they meet exclusively with<lb/> their own coreligionists&#44; there they rehearse hymns and<lb/> psalmodies which breathe devotion to Israels God our &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> Saviour.  Maidens of Israel&#33;  Can you offer two hours on the first day of<lb/> the week for the preservation perpetuation of the sentiments which<lb/> the Sunday school fostered in that establishment to the young that they may last through life&#63;<lb/>  an increase of teachers is Coadjutors to the superintendent are comparatively necessary both for the<lb/> discipline and instruction of the classes &#43; Let &#216; every one&#44;<lb/> whose hearts prompts her to contribute by personal exertions<lb/> to the perpetuation eternity of our creed&#44; become a regular&#44; a punctual<lb/> and earnest instructress teacher at the Hebrew Sunday School.<lb/>  &#43; For The number of pupils in attendance is very large&#59; for there<lb/> harmoniously blend the young children of our race&#44; irrespectively of<lb/> the mode of worship which their parents follow.  Let &#216;<lb/> ǂ Her presence will be an incentive to her scholars pupils to follow assiduity<lb/>  The zeal she displays will awaken a generous incen emulation<lb/> among them.  They also will glean in the field of her<lb/> knowledge.  The generous preceptors will have fed therewith the minds which<lb/> stand in need of religious lore&#59; those that are strangers<lb/> to the tenets of Judaism.
