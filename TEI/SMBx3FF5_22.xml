            <p>Rev. S. Morais<lb/>
                Rev &#38; Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>To&#45;day&#44; for the first<lb/> time since the receipt of both your postal cards&#44; I<lb/> find leisure to reply with a few words. I am sorry<lb/> indeed that my article has not had he effect of<lb/> convincing you that you were mistaken as to the<lb/> tendency of the Sabbath School Union&#44; and I regret<lb/> much more Dr Sonneschein&#39;s position&#44; in the prem&#45;<lb/>ises&#44; which&#44; I assure you&#44; was as much a surprise<lb/> to me as to anyone else. Still&#44; his having repub&#45;<lb/>lished my article <hi rend="underline">without</hi> any comments inclines<lb/> me to the belief that he tacitly accepts my inter&#45;<lb/>pretation. I must reiterate my former assertion&#44; that<lb/> when the Union was organized&#8212;Dr Sonneschein was<lb/> present&#8212;no one ever thought of making it an<lb/> ex&#45;parte organization. To the contrary&#44; every one<lb/> of the Gentlemen present seemed to feel glad<lb/> that by the means of uniform instruction<lb/> we might in the course of years succeed in doing<lb/> away with the odious comparison between orth&#45;<lb/>odox and reform&#44; which&#44; unfortunately&#44; comes<lb/></p>

                <p>Jacob Voorsanger&#44;<lb/>
                    Box 319<lb/>
                    Houston&#44; Texas&#44; Oct&#91;ober&#93; 17&#91;&#44;&#93; 1883<lb/></p>
            
            <p>in our controversy&#44; to the surface again. I distinctly<lb/> recollect that  there was an earnest conversation<lb/> held upon the subject of enlisting the many private<lb/> Jewish Schools of New York&#44; as well as the free<lb/> schools of that city&#8212;as you well know under<lb/> conservative control&#45;&#45; and the result of the con&#45;<lb/>versation was the insertion of the words &#34;Sab<lb/> bath Schools and kindred institutions&#34; in the ap&#45;<lb/>peal&#44; which&#44; I beg to inform you  confidentially&#44;<lb/> was entirely <hi rend="underline">my</hi> work. I must confess however&#44;<lb/> that I also never intended that the Sabbath<lb/> School Union should from the beginning <del>should</del> follow a strictly <hi rend="underline">traditional</hi> course. In fact&#44; it<lb/> was intended that the Union should only pres<lb/>ent instruction  in a manner and form object&#45;<lb/>ionable to no one&#44; and&#45;if ever the Union<lb/> will be a <hi rend="underline">fait accompli</hi>&#44; this will be the<lb/> only course it will pursue. I must confess<lb/> also&#44; that I was prepared for opposition&#44; and<lb/> much as I wish you could have been on our<lb/> side&#44; I am glad to have to give account<lb/> to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>&#44; and not to the  croakers of the press<lb/></p>

                <p>who in every new movement see an object of<lb/> self&#45;aggrandizement to its advocate&#44; much as<lb/> you differ with me&#44; I know you will not deny<lb/> me sincerity and earnestness&#44; and an honest<lb/> desire to serve God as I understand it. If I<lb/> erred in bringing this movement to the front&#44; I<lb/> have the satisfaction that God will forgive me<lb/> for I did it &#91;Hebrew&#93; for His sake and for<lb/> the sake of the Torah &#91;Hebrew&#93;. As to<lb/> my position on Rabbinical Judaism&#44; you have<lb/> slightly mistaken it&#44; as I will set forth in<lb/> a subsequent article in the Record. There is a<lb/> distinction with a big difference between Rab&#45;<lb/>binical Judaism and Rabbinistic Judaism&#44;<lb/> and admitting the beneficent influence of the former<lb/> I contend the evil influence of the latter. Am<lb/> I to estimate the influence of a Hillel&#44; an<lb/> Akiba&#44;  a Jehudah Hakadosh by the same<lb/> standard as the influence of Dr Leon&#44; Vital<lb/> Calabrese&#44; Loria&#44; and I regret to say Mose<lb/> Luzatto&#63; I cannot do it. I cannot esteem<lb/> the German &#38; Polish Rabbinists. My measure<lb/> of historical knowledge is indeed not as<lb/></p>

                <p>extensive as yours&#44; but I cannot plan on one line<lb/> Maimonides with Eliezer Rokeah&#44; nor the Span<lb/>&#45;ish Rabbis before their excellent sense bec&#45;<lb/>ame tainted with Kabbalism&#44; with that un&#45;<lb/>fortunate school of Talmudical hairsplitters&#44;<lb/> that glorified the Talmud at the expense of<lb/> the Bible&#44; and made children recite the<lb/> Mishna by heart before they well could <lb/> translate &#91;Hebrew&#93;. But I write in&#45;<lb/>coherently&#44; I feel myself  warming up with<lb/> the subject and I must not fatigue you<lb/> nor exhaust your patience. I shall set<lb/> forth my views in the Record as a reply<lb/> to yours&#44; but I shall be mindful of our<lb/> relations and never lose sight of that pro&#45;<lb/>found respect to which you are entitled<lb/> from me&#44; your junior and I may right&#45;<lb/>fully say&#44; your pupil. Your two postals<lb/> have profoundly touched me&#44; and I <lb/> am thankful to you and to God that in this clashing of opinions and this<lb/> strife after truth I will not forfeit<lb/> your good opinion.

            <p>to say&#44; but I have scarcely recovered from<lb/> the fatiguing Kippur exercises and from<lb/> yesterday&#39;s service. My time is not my own<lb/> if I am well though&#44; for a  few days&#44; with<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; I have to attend the <hi rend="underline">Visitor</hi> which<lb/> is a more severe taskmaster than my<lb/> dear congregation. With Nehemia&#91;&#63;&#93; I pray<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; for there is precious little<lb/> earthly  gain in all this business.<lb/>
                Let me&#44; before concluding wish<del>ing</del> you<lb/> with all my soul&#39;s earnestness &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> and that the Almighty may give you<lb/> many&#44; many more years of happiness&#44;<lb/> health and usefulness. Indeed&#44; were you<lb/> to be  different from what you are&#44; less se&#45;<lb/>vere&#44; less consistent&#44; less unreconciling <lb/> I could not esteem you as deeply as I<lb/> <del>am</del> do  now. Your very life is a check to<lb/> many radicals&#44; I hope it will be so as<lb/> long as God will grant you life.<lb/></p>
