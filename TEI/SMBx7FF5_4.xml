                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>Friday morning.<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear Father&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Manuel and I are most deeply<lb/> concerned about your letter.  We have thought and<lb/> reasoned and tried to find some way out of our<lb/> troubles&#44; but indeed we cannot find any solution<lb/> that seems a safe one.  The great trouble is that<lb/> even if he could be relied on at all&#44; there is no<lb/> work at present for anyone.  the Tribune is now<lb/> publishing advertisements for situations free&#44; and<lb/> begging people who can afford it to take extra<lb/> help.  Everywhere there is the same story of lack<lb/> of work.  When I was in K. C.&#44; Mr. Simm&#39;s arranged<lb/> for his being taken to St. Louis free&#44; and actually sup&#45;<lb/>posed that he had gone&#44; but at the last moment he<lb/> refused to go&#44; claiming that he could not get work<lb/> in a strange place.  We both feel certain that<lb/> the money spent on sending him away &#38; supporting<lb/> him would be thrown away at this time&#44; and we<lb/> feel that the only thing to be done&#44; is to give him<lb/> a respite to regain if possible physical strength &#38;<lb/> mental equilibrium.  That respite must be in<lb/> Minneapolis&#44; where we shall keep him as short<lb/> a time as possible &#38; then send him to his<lb/> next destination as soon as something offers.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Of course I never intended to say that he should<lb/> work in Phila. or remain there permanently.  If<lb/> you still wish him to be sent to Texas&#44; Manuel<lb/> will go to Chicago for that purpose but it seems<lb/> to us that this will not shorten our evil days.<lb/></p>
            <p>As to his coming here.  It seems to me that it would<lb/> be best to manage it so.  You write to him and<lb/> say that you cannot take him&#44; but that for your<lb/> sake&#44; we have consented to do so.  That he is to<lb/> be here until he has recovered himself&#44; meanwhile<lb/> using every means to obtain work far from<lb/> us all.  That he is to remain in the house<lb/> while here&#44; unless he goes out with me and<lb/> to try not to abuse our confidence while with<lb/> us.  That he is to write to me at once<lb/> or to telegraph telling me when he will be here.<lb/>  Now&#44; dear Papa&#44; you know that it gives me<lb/> happiness to do anything for you&#44; and since I<lb/> have a husband who is ready to bear my<lb/> burdens&#44; you must let us do this&#59; hoping that<lb/> it may turn out for the best.  I know that<lb/> the fact that he is here will relieve you from<lb/> a little of your anxiety at least as regards<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>the money&#44; let us wait to speak of that.<lb/></p>
            <p>Manuel advises that you take his &#40;L&#39;s&#41; receipt<lb/> in the form of <hi rend="underline">note</hi> for all money you<lb/> have sent &#38; continue to send.  You will understand<lb/> the reason for this.<lb/></p>
            <p>Indeed my heart aches when I think of<lb/> all your troubles&#44; and I do not find any comfort<lb/> Your loving<lb/> Nina<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear Mr. Morais&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>My judgment is that it would be a<lb/> waste of money and perhaps worse&#44; to send Leon into a strange<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>place now.  He ought to be taken where he can get some encour&#45;<lb/>agement and some physical rest.  I know of no plan better than<lb/> Nina&#39;s for that purpose&#44; and for myself&#44; I shall be glad to do<lb/> what I can to give Leon another start.  There is always hope for<lb/> better things&#44; and I should feel that I had not done my duty&#44; if<lb/> I did not give the boy a helping hand.  I know that Leon&#39;s<lb/> conduct has given you much pain and anxiety&#44; but he may still<lb/> be a credit to you.  Much stranger things have happened.  He is young<lb/> and thoughtless.  He is physically worn out&#44; and he cannot readily re&#45;<lb/>sist temptations.  Let us give him another chance&#44; and when the proper<lb/> time comes&#44; start him again with health and hope.  I don&#39;t think any of<lb/> us will need regret what we do for him.  Yours Truly<lb/> Emanuel<lb/></p>
