            <p>It is written somewhere&#45;&#45;the exact placement I cannot<lb/> now recall&#45;&#45;that he who causes a single blade of grass to<lb/> grow may claim the title of benefactor.  I do not<lb/> aspire to that appellation&#45;&#45;most certainly not as a<lb/> laborer of the soil&#45;&#45;but I do wish that my work&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing on another ground&#45;&#45;equally the creation of God&#45;&#45;may<lb/> be rewarded.  Should I succeed in awakening one thought<lb/> in the minds of Jewish youths&#44; and that thought prove<lb/> of advantage to my religion and people&#44; I shall have earned the<lb/> name of &#34;useful servant.&#34;  So believing&#44; I accepted<lb/> the invitation to lecture also this year before the Young<lb/> Men&#39;s Hebrew Association&#44; and I chose a subject capable&#44;<lb/> I fancy&#44; of producing a measurably good results.<lb/></p>
            
            <p>In a far off land&#44; where the sun tans the skin&#44; and<lb/> enervates the body&#44; a vast population dwelling apart ply the tools<lb/> of the artisans.  Their looks and their address clearly tell that<lb/> to confound those individuals with the inhabitants of the<lb/> country at large would be an error.  Whence came then<lb/> the hardy mountaineers so distinct in appearance and habits&#63;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>The question was asked by many a <sic>traveller</sic>&#44; but it<lb/> still remains yet an unsolved problem open debatable.  Not so with that<lb/> distant population.  To express a doubt concerning<lb/> what has been transmitted from ancient days&#44; would<lb/> be accounted deemed a grievous offence.  The veriest dullard<lb/> will glibly rehears his story in the full assurance that it is<lb/> beyond dispute.  Let me relate it.<lb/></p>
            <p>A queen&#44; curious to know a youthful Ruler&#44; whose fame<lb/> had spread throughout the East&#44; visited the capital of his<lb/> kingdoms.  She was witty&#44; brilliant&#44; generous&#59; but her<lb/> discernment beheld sagacity discerned those qualities more strongly <sic>developped</sic><lb/> in the king&#44; whose acquaintance she had eagerly sought.  His<lb/> wise answers to incisive reasonings&#59; the splendour of<lb/> his court&#44; and the reciprocity of feelings evinced by muni&#45;<lb/>&#45;ficent gifts&#44; made the royal guest leave Jerusalem<lb/> in wonderment.  This part of the narrative has<lb/> scriptural and Rabbinical authority for support.<lb/>  All are aware that the queen of Arabia Felix was ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;gnificently entertained by King Solomon&#44; and that the<lb/> two crowned personages profusely exchanged marks of<lb/> esteem.  But no one versed in either Biblical or Talmudical<lb/> writings has learnt from them the weird tale tacked to the incident&#44;<lb/> which our prophets and Sages chronicled and commented upon.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>According to that strange account an intimacy&#44; which<lb/> culminated into an alliance and the birth of a son&#44; grew<lb/> out of the visit paid by the queen of Sheba.  Her dominion<lb/> lay South East of Egypt.  On her return she destined the<lb/> child whom Solomon could claim as his own&#44; to have a to be<lb/> a champion of his father&#39;s belief.  And in order that the<lb/> lad might quaff at the fountain of Divine wisdom&#44;<lb/> she sent him to Palestine and had him taught in the<lb/> spirit of Mosaic institutions&#44; and in all the tenets of<lb/> the five revealed books.  Minglik&#45;&#45;so the youth was<lb/> called&#45;&#45;had become very popular.  Going back to sit on<lb/> the throne which his mother had voluntarily vacated&#44;<lb/> an immense numberless multitude of Israelites followed in the train&#44;<lb/> carrying along the ark of the covenant.  But his piety<lb/> had not kept equal pace with his temporal success.  Having<lb/> arrived at the banks of a certain river upon the Sab&#45;<lb/>&#45;bath&#44; he Minglik dared cross it regardless of the sanctity of<lb/> the day.  Some of his retinue however refused thus to sin.<lb/>  From those <sic>stanch</sic> ones Palestinians sprung the Falashas&#44; who at<lb/> no time ever since could lured be enticed into a relinquishing of<lb/> Judaism.  They alone are able to approach the spot&#44;<lb/> where the ark was enshrined.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>When a learned and holy man among their number<lb/> repairs to Axum&#45;&#45;the ancient capital of Abyssinia&#45;&#45;<lb/> the walls of the fane in which the written word of<lb/> the Lord still remains abides open miraculously and receive him that he<lb/> may devoutly worship.<lb/></p>
            <p>I will not offend the intelligence of my hearers and<lb/> stop to show the absurdities of the story handed down&#44;<lb/> in the main&#44; as I have reported it&#59; but I will ask that I may<lb/> present to view some interesting points relative to a<lb/> body of our coreligionists&#44; who are entitled to an affection&#45;<lb/>&#45;ate consideration.  And I simply discharge a debt of<lb/> gratitude when I tell at the outset the source whence<lb/> I mostly derived the knowledge I can am enabled to impart on the subject.<lb/>  Philoxene Luzzatto&#44; the intellectual hero marvel hero who had mastered<lb/> the language of the Falashas&#44; in the hope of hastening<lb/> to their religious redemption&#59; who journeyed away from<lb/> home and to ransacked foreign libraries&#44; and read all which could<lb/> be read regarding that population&#44; who corresponded with<lb/> savants in the interest thereof&#44; and finally with a dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;tinguished member of those forgotten fellow&#45;believers&#44; that<lb/> ever to be lamented Italian youth&#44; left a legacy bequeathed an instrument of utility which<lb/> would alone suffice to render his name immortal che to curve for him a niche in the temple<lb/> of fame.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>Writhing in the agonies of an acute and fatal disease&#44;<lb/> when he had not yet reached the twenty <sic>forth</sic> year of his<lb/> age&#44; he turned a loving thought to the Falashas&#44; and<lb/> completed the relation of his profound and exhaustive researches respecting<lb/> them a few days before his eyes closed in death.  That<lb/> very learned scholar holds that the Jews of Abyssinia are<lb/> descendants of a mixed race.  Not in the palmy days of<lb/> Solomon&#44; did a colony of Israelites prefer African regions to the<lb/> &#34;Zion&#45;hill....and Siloa&#39;s brook that flowed fast by the ark<lb/> of God&#34;; but five centuries after&#44; the fate of battles brought<lb/> about the change.  &#182; The fierce struggle among<lb/> the generals of Alexander the great to share the richest<lb/> spoil left by the Macedonian conqueror&#44; exposed Judea<lb/> to hardships.  Ptolemy son of Lagus&#44;&#45;&#45;misnamed Soter&#44;<lb/> the Saviour&#45;&#45;&#44; in his greed for power had violently taken seized<lb/> Syria.  The Hebrews&#44; who&#44; since their return from the<lb/> Babylonian captivity&#44; paid an annual impost to some<lb/> foreign potentates&#44; recognized at the time Laomedon as<lb/> the legitimate Ruler to whom their tribute was due.<lb/>  Faithful to their promise&#44; they refused <sic>yeilding</sic> to the de&#45;<lb/>&#45;mands of the usurper&#44; and prepared to contest his pretensions.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>Ptolemy cut to the quick&#44; resolved to make the people<lb/> of Palestine pay very dearly for what he deemed considered the height<lb/> of insolence.  On a Sabbath day his soldiery stormed<lb/> and pillaged Jerusalem.  Its inhabitants were unsuspectedly enjoying<lb/> the prescribed rest.  The attack was sudden and brutal stunned them&#59; so sudden it was and so brutal.<lb/>  Thousands fell victims to the barbarous sword which<lb/> spared neither age nor sex.  But the victor was too<lb/> keenly alive to his advantage not to understand that<lb/> men who had would have braved his <sic>redoutable</sic> army rather than<lb/> become guilty of perjury&#44; were worthy bringing being lured over to his side.<lb/>  He put the sword back into the scabbard&#44; and offered con&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciliatory terms.  The shrewd Prince wished to win<lb/> the goodwill of the youngest and strongest among the<lb/> Hebrews.  Egypt was the objective point of his plans.<lb/>  And Egypt&#45;&#45;unaccountably as it may seem&#45;&#45;had always<lb/> possessed some attraction for the descendants of the tribes once<lb/> slaves in the country of the Pharaohs.  Alexander had<lb/> already drawn many of them Judeans to the famous city he had<lb/> built to perpetuate his name&#44; and Ptolemy Soter made <lb/>willing captives of over one hundred thousand Judeans of that people&#44; who<lb/> peopled thronged the towns watered by the Nile.  They were joined soon<lb/> after by a still larger number&#44; which&#44; in the somewhat hyperbolical<lb/> language of the Talmud&#44; amounted to several millions.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>In the opinion of the elder Luzzatto&#44; and I infer<lb/> that his son coincides therewith&#44; our ancestors having<lb/> settled in the land of the pyramids&#44; and especially along the borders of<lb/> Nubia&#44; where they had been assigned the custody of the<lb/> city Cyrene or Cyrena&#239;ca&#44; obeyed a natural prompt&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing for gaining light on matters lying yet unknown in obscurity.  Some<lb/> passed over Senaar&#44; and explored the interior of Africa.<lb/>  The wild tribes dwelling there welcomed the strangers&#44;<lb/> who excelled as mechanics and men of letters&#44; and either<lb/> by compulsion or by choice&#44; the Jewish foreigners strangers remained<lb/> in the midst of the native negros&#44; and in the course<lb/> of time unavoidably intermarried.  The effect produced by which this<lb/> circumstance produced was the acceptance of Judaism by a mongrel<lb/> race&#44; which at a period impossible to ascertain founded<lb/> a kingdom&#44; called Abyssinia&#44;&#45;&#45;in Arabic Habashun.  I my&#45;<lb/>&#45;self cannot tell the origin of this name&#44; nor do I possess<lb/> the linguistic capacity to ascertain&#44; whether its sound is<lb/> retained in the great variety of African languages and<lb/> dialects&#44; but I venture the idea&#45;&#45;and let it be taken for<lb/> what is worth&#45;&#45;that the derivation of the term may be<lb/> traced to the Hebrew Chabosh&#44; meaning &#34;to rule&#44;&#34; or<lb/></p>

            <p>Cabosh &#34;to conquer&#59;&#34; signifying that the territory<lb/> acquired belonged to the tribes who established<lb/> there a distinct dominion&#45;&#45;a Jewish dominion&#45;&#45;.  Historians agree<lb/> that till the fourth century of the vulgar era<lb/> the Abyssinians professed the Mosaic religion&#45;&#45;and they<lb/> may have limitedly cultivated the sacred tongue.  Even<lb/> after having embraced Christianity&#44; Jewish customs to which we cling&#44; had<lb/> a powerful hold of there on them them.  Some Scriptural practices are<lb/> indeed retained to this day&#44; but from the moment that the<lb/> majority bowed to the Cross&#44; a chasm deep and impassable opened between them<lb/> and their countrymen and fellow&#45;believers&#44; the Falashas&#45;&#45;<lb/>  &#91;insert lines from page 8a&#93; But what course did those the unwavering adorers of one incor&#45;<lb/>&#45;poreal God follow&#63;  How did they succeed in forming<lb/> a separate government&#63;  By what means did they<lb/> long maintain their independence on the steep mount&#45;<lb/>&#45;ains of Simen where many they still dwell&#44; in and how did they finally lose that great boon&#63;  These queries<lb/> have been variously answered solved&#44; but with so much which<lb/> savors of the legendary&#44; that an impartial reader cannot<lb/> trust the speculative or credulous writer.  Nevertheless&#44;<lb/> the account I have undertaken to give would be too<lb/> incomplete&#44; without alluding to the probable mutations<lb/> undergone by the stout&#45;hearted Monottheists&#44; during the ages<lb/> that have rolled away.<lb/></p>

            <p>These chose then an appellation significative of their sense of<lb/> wrong profoundly felt.  &#34;The Exiles&#44;&#34; who&#44; for principles&#39;<lb/> sake left their homes and went in quest of another spot<lb/> where they might worship the living Saviour according to the<lb/> dictates of their conscience.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>To such vicissitudes will I have special particular reference.<lb/>  After the schism&#44; a spirit of mutual hatred mani&#45;<lb/>fested itself in open hostilities.  At one time the<lb/> Falashas brought grew mighty&#44; and subjected brought the Abyssinians under to under the heavy yoke.<lb/>  Led again and again to victory by their own gallant<lb/> Rulers&#44; they displayed martial valor and deep devotion<lb/> to the cause of Mosaism.  The exploits of their<lb/> heroic queen Judith&#44; the beautiful who defied the Salic law and sat herself upon a throne&#59; and who <sic>weilded</sic> her sceptre with who wore on her royal<lb/> sceptre manly vigor and swore thereupon to unfurl the ensign of the Unity on every<lb/> hill&#44; and tread upon down the symbol of the Trinity&#44; might<lb/> he supply a fertile mind with a fit subject for a romance.  Evidently&#44; the<lb/> Falashas did not always prevail&#44; and when the Church<lb/> came off triumphant&#44; they were made to swallow to<lb/> the very dregs the bitter cup of persecution.<lb/></p>
            <p>In the beginning of the 14th century galled by the vexations<lb/> of the Abyssinians Emperor&#44; they struck for freedom.  The<lb/> hour seemed opportune.  Hordes of Mohammedants knocked<lb/> at the gates of Axum.  And the neo swarthy Christians were<lb/> compelled to rise and buckle on the armor in self&#45;defence.<lb/>  The Falashas believeding that the independence they dearly<lb/> loved could now be purchased by a prodigious effort.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>Like an avalanche they rushed down from their<lb/> moutnains to overwhelm the foes harassed already by a foreign invader&#44; but the blood of profusely shed by the undaunted<lb/> warriors profusely shed&#44; reddened the battle&#45;field.  A <sic>woful</sic> defeat harried<lb/> the fugitives back to their impregnable rocks.<lb/></p>
            <p>A century later the same attempt met with results equally<lb/> disastrous.  To add to the chagrin of the conquered&#44; a<lb/> Nazarene church was built on the spot in which they had been<lb/> completely routed.  Then the demoniac device which<lb/> gave Spain an infamous immortality&#44; was concocted<lb/> in Abyssinia.  A catholic priest whose name should be handed<lb/> down to execration&#45;&#45;Amda Sion&#45;&#45;stirred up the government<lb/> to publish an edict worthy of a Torquemada.  In accordance<lb/> with it all were demanded&#44; under penalty of confiscation<lb/> and flagellation&#44; to wear an amulet on the right hand.<lb/>  It bore the following inscription.  &#34;I renounce the devil through<lb/> Jesus Christ our lord.&#34;  The hapless Falashas horror&#45;struck<lb/> at the Pharotic a pitiless ordinance&#44; which aimed at their apostacy<lb/> or extermination&#44; thought the great day of judgment had<lb/> drawn nigh.  Not unlike some of the ascetic Essenes<lb/> in the unfortunate soul&#45;harrowing days of the Roman dominion in Judea&#44;<lb/> a member withdrew from the busy world&#44; and&#44; choosing a state<lb/> of celibacy&#44; gave themselves to prayer and penance.<lb/></p>

            <p>But the spirit of the multitude though oppressed<lb/> was not crushed.  In 1537&#44; the daring <sic>mountaneers</sic><lb/> of Simen&#44; <sic>marshalled</sic> by Gideon their a fearless chieftain&#44;<lb/> faced the enemy in a pitched battle&#44; and exacted honorable<lb/> terms.  The Abyssinians who&#44; notwithstanding the assist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance but by the Portuguese Christopper of Gama&#45;&#45;the<lb/> son of the celebrated Vasco De Gama&#45;&#45;&#44; had suffered severely<lb/> from the incursions of Mohammedan tribes&#44; gladly made<lb/> peace with their neighbors.  To mildly restrain them became a imperative necessity measure of self&#45;preservation.  But what policy and<lb/> an outward pressure had suggested&#44; could not be of long<lb/> duration.  &#34;A new king arose who knew not&#34; or rather<lb/> heeded not the pledge his predecessor had given.  Of a<lb/> fierce temperament&#44; he indulged in cruelties which out&#45;<lb/>&#45;raged nature.  They maddened the Falashas into a rash<lb/> act.  Imprudent it was to leave in accessible rocks<lb/> and descend to fight on the plain that prototype second<lb/> of Atilla.  Outwitted by a superior military skill&#44;<lb/> the Jews found themselves surrounded on all sides.  They<lb/> beheld with unspeakable dismay every chance of retreat<lb/> cut off.  Those whom the bereaving sword did not consume&#44;<lb/> submitted to shocking indignities.<lb/></p>

            <p>But the measure cup of misfortune&#44; which our distant<lb/> brethren endured was filled drunk&#44; overrun in the seventeenth century<lb/> under The reign of Socinios with of terror&#44; whose annals are &#91;&#63;&#93; with a pen dipped in &#91;&#63;&#93; the annals of which heave forth the sighs and groans&#44; begin with of the butchered&#44; began with Socinios&#44; the s usurper of the<lb/> Abyssinian throne.  This monarch in whose veins<lb/> coursed some Falashan blood&#44; illustrated the fact so<lb/> degrading to human nature&#44; but which we Iraelites have too<lb/> often experienced.  These people from whose national rela&#45; kinship<lb/> &#45;tionship we had a right to expect a considerate&#44; if not<lb/> an affectionate treatment&#44; proved most unrelenting in giving<lb/> vent to their hatred.  Socinios determined to either<lb/> drag the Falashas under the sign of the cross&#44; or to<lb/> root them out&#59; and he very nearly succeeded.  Con&#45;<lb/>&#45;summate generals were placed set at the head of troops well<lb/> trained to war&#44; with the fight.  The peremptory command was&#44; not to<lb/> reappear into the presence of their ferocious master&#44; until<lb/> they could bring the tidings could be brought that his diabolical inexorable will had<lb/> been fulfilled.  The struggle for civil and religious<lb/> liberty grew ardent.  It arose to sublimity&#44; but a Mattathias<lb/> was not there to hue down Empiety Iniquity with his holy hand.<lb/>  The unequal contest had not been destined by the <sic>Aribiter</sic><lb/> of wars&#45;&#45; the Lord of hosts&#44; to end in a Maccabean<lb/> success triumph.<lb/></p>

            <p>A man who verily did not indeed shame the Biblical<lb/> champ hero whose name he bore&#44; grappled with the ruthless<lb/> antagonist&#44; but he fell slain among his heroic brave countrymen<lb/> who fought for the noblest idea.  Gideon&#44; the last<lb/> general and Ruler of the Falashas&#44; deserved to have<lb/> lived for the defence of Right against Might&#44; yet<lb/> he was mercifully spared the disgrace awaiting his<lb/> survivors.  For Socinios butchered massacred the <sic>combattants</sic>; sold<lb/> their children to slavery&#44; and gave the Jews of the<lb/> conquered provinces this a fearful alternative&#58; baptism or the<lb/> grave.  Many feigned conversion to avoid the a slaughter<lb/> of all they held dear.  Similarly to the Marranos<lb/> of Spain and Portugal&#44; they hoped and silently watched for the <sic>opponunity</sic><lb/> when they might ear off the <sic>destested</sic> mask.  The<lb/> occasion presented itself earlier than anticipated.  For the Nemesis of an infallible retributive vengeance quickened her steps.

While<lb/> the Rabbinists begin to count fifty days from the second<lb/> day of Passover the festival&#44; and the Caraites and Samaritans from<lb/> the Sunday during which the festival is kept&#44; the Falashas<lb/> wait till the expiration of the Passover and then commence<lb/> to reckon the seven full weeks.
