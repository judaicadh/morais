            <p>Philadelphia&#44; 12<lb/>15<lb/>1844&#91;<lb/> in date added by author&#93;<lb/>
                Rev. Dr. B. Felsenthal.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>My dear Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>You are exceedingly kind and I am thankful for your<lb/> friendly expressions.<lb/></p>
            <p>On seeing your article about the use of wine among us<lb/> for religious purposes&#44; I felt prompted to call the attention of a<lb/> Mr. Brace to it. That gentlemen has had a long and persistently<lb/> kept up controversy with a &#34;Temperance Appreciater&#34;¬ù. He assures<lb/> me that personally he favors temperance&#44; but he dislikes some of<lb/> the means to which the opponents of spiritous liquors resort to<lb/> carry out their otherwise laudable object. They have been telling<lb/> the public that Jews would not pronounce a benediction over a<lb/> beverage likely to intoxicate. I&#44; who from study and experience&#44;<lb/> know better&#44; have supported Mr. Brace&#39;s ideas&#44; though I never<lb/> openly took part in the dispute. I have just read with pleasure<lb/> the other note of yours in the Student.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am free to say that I never heard the name &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> in Italy&#44; nor did I become acquainted with the manner in which<lb/> my coreligionists&#44; the &#91;Hebrew&#93;¬ù use it&#44; till I went to London.<lb/> But &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; what is not met in Tuscany&#44; may exist<lb/> elsewhere in the peninsula. I venture to guess that &#34;Pacifico&#34;¬ù<lb/> is the representative of &#91;Hebrew&#93;. However&#44; the name &#91;Hebrew&#93;¬ù<lb/> is common in Leghorn&#44; so also a number of names which&#44; during my<lb/> long residence in America&#44; I have never had occasion to hear&#44; are<lb/> general in my native city&#59; for instance&#44;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;  <lb/> the name&#91;Hebrew&#93;¬ù<lb/>&#91;Hebrew&#93; to which you refer&#44; and which I found in the<lb/> place you quote&#44; seems to me rather a stretch of independence in<lb/> the selection of a child&#39;s &#91;Hebrew&#93;. Still &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Of course&#44; you are well aware that the lamented &#91;Hebrew&#93; <lb/> was so called by his celebrated father&#44; because he was born when<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; was engaged in his work on &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; whom&#44; at that time&#44; he<lb/> considered the genuine &#91;Hebrew&#93; that gave us the Aramaic version of<lb/> the Pentateuch. You will have observed in his &#91;Hebrew&#93; that since<lb/> then &#91;Hebrew&#93; and he inclines to agree as to the<lb/> identification of  &#91;Hebrew&#93; with &#91;Hebrew&#93;. So likewise his Isaiah &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> was called so&#44; after the prophet&#44; whom &#91;Hebrew&#93; was &#32; at<lb/>  the time of his birth. In Italy and among the &#91;Hebrew&#93; it is deemed<lb/> a mark of respect to call one&#39;s children after their grandparents&#44;<lb/> whilst the latter are living&#44; but I notice that among the &#91;Hebrew&#93;¬ù <lb/> a superstitious opposition to the practice exists. Yet&#44; look at the<lb/> strange anomaly&#59; you will have occasion to call to the law &#94; a &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> a &#91;Hebrew&#93; a circumstance<lb/> which never came under my observation in Italy nor in England among<lb/> the Portuguese.<lb/></p>
            <p>Wishing to be favored by your letter&#44; whenever you can<lb/> spare a few moments&#44; and are in perfect health&#44; I remain<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours sincerely&#44;<lb/>
                				S. Morais<lb/></p>
