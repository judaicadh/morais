            <p>April 12&#44; 1882<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I have read with much interest your letter of March<lb/> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and only regret&#44; that my many occupations and the<lb/> intervening holidays prevented me from replying sooner.  To<lb/> enter into the merits of our present discussion at once&#58; you<lb/> denounce Bernstein and <del>our</del> give him some hard knocks<lb/> on the knuckles&#44; yet pardon me&#44; if I am still impressed<lb/> with the extraordinary similarity of the stories of Gen&#44;<lb/>esis and kings.  I have always been a devoted follower of<lb/> the science of philology&#44; and especially under the rules<lb/> of that science B&#39;s deductions are perfectly admissible<lb/> But granted&#44; that you are right on every point&#8212;what<lb/> about the Samson and Herakles comparison&#63;  Surely<lb/> <hi rend="underline">there</hi> one finds more than accident&#44; namely the drawing<lb/> on a common source of information.  A few other examples.<lb/>  In the last number of the Hebrew Review Dr. Haupt<lb/> satisfactorily proves&#44; that the flood story is a transcript<lb/> &#40;almost literally&#41; from an Assyrian or Chaldean<lb/> story.  I knew long ago that the first chapter of Genesis<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>was a <del>use</del> transcript from a like source.  Enf. Graetz&#44;<lb/> following the Frenchman Bertheau&#44; identifies &#91;Hebrew&#93; and<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; with Apollo &#40;Helios&#41; and makes &#91;Hebrew&#93; their<lb/> sister the same as Venus &#40;the moon&#41;. &#91;Hebrew&#93; is<lb/> the <del>the</del> Etrurian Toelchin&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; Gr. &#91;Greek&#93;&#44; and by drop&#44;<lb/>ping the S. which is perfectly permissible the Latins<lb/> had Vulcan &#40;us&#41; who was a blacksmith&#44; as &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> was the worker in iron and brass.<lb/></p>
            <p>Be these things as they may&#44; &#38; much remains true<lb/> that we stand at the door of a revolution.  What for&#44;<lb/>merly has been the private opinion of scholars is now<lb/> becoming public property&#44; and when a man like<lb/> Dr. Lilienthal &#91;Hebrew&#93; publicly proclaims &#40;Hebrew<lb/> Review&#44; page 130&#41; that the Bible contains &#34;legendary<lb/> parts&#44;&#34; and that &#34;especially the Mosaic Books are com&#44;<lb/>posed of various parts&#44; written and collected at var&#44;<lb/>ious times&#34; we have cause for serious meditation.  If<lb/> this assertion be true <sic>than</sic> &#91;Hebrew&#93; is a <hi rend="underline">licentia<lb/> scribenda</hi>&#44; if not to denominate it by a harsher ex<lb/>pression&#59; and the prophet who said &#91;Hebrew&#93;...<lb/>....&#91;Hebrew&#93; did not know anything about<lb/> what he was saying.  Can you then be surprised<lb/></p>

            <p>that we youngsters&#44; who <hi rend="underline">must</hi> follow the directions <del>of</del><lb/> <del>the</del> and tendencies of the age are sadly perplexed&#63;  In view of<lb/> the foregoing I beg to represent to you that my diffi&#44;<lb/>culty is not exactly the harmonization of the scriptures<lb/> with critics and criticism&#44; but only how to apply the<lb/> letter so that the former may remain &#91;Hebrew&#93; I have<lb/> read much&#59; thank God that my faith has not suffered&#44;<lb/> and when in the article answered by you I quoted Hab&#44;<lb/>bakkuk it was to indicate&#44; that <hi rend="underline">his</hi> golden rule<lb/> was indeed the only <hi rend="underline">safe</hi> rule&#44; and that not creed<lb/> but deed&#44; not scholarly attainments&#44; but humble work&#44;<lb/> not scrupulous text&#45;criticism&#44; but pious compliance<lb/> with the text&#39;s demands were to lead to happiness.<lb/>  Am I not right&#63;  What perplexes me is not how<lb/> to learn for myself&#44; but how to teach my block and<lb/> my <del>prof</del> pupils.  If I err for myself&#44; it is simply<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; but if I err in my teachings&#44; is <hi rend="underline">that</hi><lb/> not unpardonable&#63;  Hence I criticized your talk.<lb/>  I thought and still think&#8212;that our people cannot<lb/> yet stand the risk of radical text&#45;criticism&#44; and<lb/> that it is untimely to discuss before them works like<lb/></p>

            <p>Of course I respect your reluctance to enter the field of<lb/> polemics&#44; and I shall therefore not continue to write on this<lb/> subject.  I have recently withdrawn from the J. S. mainly<lb/> because its proprietor is impractical and unmanageable&#44;<lb/> but I shall not remain idle.  I have a passion for writing<lb/> and as long as I can therewith serve the cause I am con<lb/>tent.  I may&#44; in course of time&#44; develop into a &#34;story teller&#44;&#34;<lb/> for I discover in one a growing taste for writing sketches<lb/> and tales&#44; which have already given Koppel von Vloomburg<lb/> something of a reputation.  I thank you for your kind advice<lb/> to &#34;study the situation&#34; it is really necessary&#44; for my income<lb/> is beginning to be disproportionate to my expenditures.  Hap<lb/>pily my dear people will raise my salary next month<lb/> with an additional &#35;300.  I have lately subscribed for the<lb/> new Wilna edition of the &#91;&#63;&#93; and &#91;Hebrew&#93;; it will cost a<lb/> great deal of money&#44; but I need a complete edition.  Time<lb/> fails me to write more.  I hope to be honored again with a<lb/> few lines&#44; and with regards to Miss Morais and the<lb/> children I am	sincerely yours<lb/></p>
