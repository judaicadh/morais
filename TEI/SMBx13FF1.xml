            <p>Ladies &#38; Gentlemen.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  With gratitude to all who labor for the revival of<lb/> Jewish literature&#44; as one of the means&#44; by which to reawaken<lb/> a sense of dependence upon the Director and Preserver of Israel&#44; <lb/>and to ensure a promote practical reverence for the laws He prescribed&#44; I<lb/> accepted the task assigned ot me by the Association I have<lb/> now the honor to address.  The period of history in which the<lb/> land of our fathers&#44; struggled&#44; in vain&#44; against the colossal power<lb/> of Babylon&#44; the events that happened during the sojourn of<lb/> the Palestinian exiles in Chaldea&#44; and the restoration of from the cap&#45;<lb/>&#45;tivity by the edict of a Persian King&#44; form the subject of on<lb/> which I have been requested to speak.  The mind of my<lb/> audience will readily suggest the necessity of dispensing with<lb/> any introductory remarks&#44; and of condensing the theme&#45;&#45;with&#45;<lb/>&#45;out rendering it obscure&#45;&#45;so that it may not exceed a reasonable<lb/> time&#44; during which I may hope to obtain a patient hearing.<lb/>  24 centuries ago &#182; Twenty four centuries ago&#44; a foreign embassy arrived at Jerusalem.  It was<lb/> headed by the son of a Ruler&#44; bearing letters and gifts.  These<lb/> were designed to express sentiments of high regard for the man&#44;<lb/> who sat upon the throne of Judah.  In the &#91;&#63;&#93; of<lb/> his days&#44; Hezekiah had been suddenly compassed with by the<lb/> shadows of death.  But he prayed for life&#44; and God granted it.<lb/></p>

            <p>The distinguished personages he greeted&#44; had received from their<lb/> royal master&#44; Baladan King of a distant country&#44; called<lb/> Babylon&#44; the charge of offering congratulations and tokens of<lb/> friendship to the monarch providentially restored to health.<lb/>  Hezekiah fully deserved the honor&#44; but he overestimated it.<lb/>  Nor did he penetrate into the political motives&#44; which had&#44;<lb/> in all likelihood&#44; actuated the Ruler who paid&#44; the Sovereign<lb/> of a far&#45;off nation&#44; respect&#44; in so signal a manner.  Elated<lb/> at the idea of receiving at his court envoys who had travel&#45;<lb/>&#45;led&#44; for his sake&#44; from the banks of the Euphrates to the hills<lb/> of Moraih&#44; he made a grand display of all the riches he<lb/> possessed.  But what had escaped the discernment of the<lb/> King of Judah&#44; the prophet of Judah&#44; would seem to have<lb/> clearly detected.  Babylon had come to search how far to what extent<lb/> could Palestine be utilized&#44; to use a modern phrase&#44; either as<lb/> an ally or as a subjugated province.  Isaiah&#39;s broad looks<lb/> must have peered into the ambitious schemes of a tributary<lb/> of Assyria&#44; and he rebuked Hezekiah for having allowed<lb/> his vanity to overreach his sagacity discretion.  &#34;That very power&#44;&#34;<lb/> said the divinely illumined mentor&#44; &#34;that very power which now flatter my pays thee so extraordinary<lb/> you a compliment will&#44; one day&#44; plunder the property you wealth thou hast exhibited&#44;<lb/> and ruin overthrow ruin the land it has surveyed.&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>Babylon dear hearers&#33;&#44; like so many Eastern countries&#44; had been brought<lb/> to a state of <sic>vassallage</sic>&#44; by the all&#45;sweeping Assyria.  But&#44;<lb/> she that prided herself on her founder&#44; the mighty Nimrod&#44;<lb/> and on her former greatness&#44; could not tamely stoop to the<lb/> Conqueror.  She studied the opportunities enabling her to<lb/> master sufficient strength&#44; so as to deal a staggering blow<lb/> at her liege lord&#44; and thus regain supremacy.  Hezekiah did<lb/> not live to see that run of the political wheel&#44; by which<lb/> Babylon rose high&#44; was lifted to its former height&#59; but the prediction of Isaiah was too received&#44; unhappily&#44; received a<lb/> literally <sic>fulfilment</sic>.  How often we mortal beings pray for short&#45;sighted mortals petition for<lb/> that which eventuates in a disasters&#33;  Better would<lb/> it have been&#44; humanely speaking&#44; if the disease&#44; which<lb/> had once prostrated the monarch of Judah&#44; had carried him<lb/> to the grave.  His dominions would not have been then in&#45;<lb/>&#45;herited by a young child&#44; whose surroundings and edu&#45;<lb/>&#45;cation shaped him into an incarnate fiend.  For&#44; Menasseh<lb/> grew to be the open enemy of his father&#39;s religion&#59; a scourge<lb/> to his people&#44; the cause of exposing the country&#44; through<lb/> its weakness&#44; to the incursions of aggressive Assyria&#44; and<lb/> of preparing paving the way for to its total overthrow&#44; by re&#45;<lb/>&#45;suscitated Babylon.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>Menasseh having ascended the throne when only twelve<lb/> years of age&#44; was&#44; doubtless&#44; brought up among tampered with by individuals<lb/> opposed to the rigorous measures which Hezekiah adopted&#44;<lb/> to reinstate the worship of the One indivisible God upon Mosaic principles.<lb/>  Disappointed because they could not enjoy lucrative offices<lb/> as priests of the altars raised heretofore in every city&#59;<lb/> foiled&#44; perhaps&#44; in the attempt of indulging into the<lb/> immoral wanton diversions of neighboring heathens&#44; they resolved<lb/> that the new king should be of quite a different stamp<lb/> from his predecessor.  How they succeeded&#44; history could<lb/> not tell with more fearful significance&#44; than by saying declaring<lb/> that Menasseh led his subjects to do more evil than the<lb/> nations Canaanitish tribes&#44; whom the Lord destroyed before the children because of their crimes<lb/> of Israel&#44; had ever done&#59; and&#44; again&#44; that Menasseh shed<lb/> so much innocent blood&#44; as to fill Jerusalem with it&#44;<lb/> from one end to the other.  Even if his son Amon<lb/> had copied his grand&#45;Sire instead of having adhered so<lb/> closely to the destructive policy of his father&#44; little good<lb/> could have been achieved.  For over half a century&#44; Judah<lb/> had been sinking into dissolution.  To restore it to a nor&#45;<lb/>mal state&#44; it needed a greater upheaval&#44; than the efforts<lb/> of a single man&#44; however influentially strong and thoroughly<lb/> patriotic&#44; could might possibly create.<lb/></p>

            <p>If the endeavours of one person could have effected a<lb/> lasting change&#44; surely those made by Josiah would surely have<lb/> brought about a glorious regeneration.  For&#44; we may search look<lb/> among the annals of the sacred canon&#44; and we will not find<lb/> his equal for the unabated energy with which he blotted out every<lb/> vestige of idolatry&#44; for the unsparing &#40;some my term it<lb/> fierce&#41; determination of searching and rooting out the<lb/> adherents of debauching polytheism&#44; for his religious ardor in de&#45;<lb/>&#45;claring the supremacy of the book of the Law&#44; which<lb/> Helkiah the priest had found&#44; neglected in its original genuineness&#44; in a spot&#44; where<lb/> contributions for the repairing of the Temple had been de&#45;<lb/>&#45;posited.  But too enervated had the people become&#44;<lb/> to maintain itself by the moral force of its superior<lb/> tenets.  The whizzing of the arrow&#44; which struck Josiah<lb/> at Meggido&#44; when&#44; fearing an invasion&#44; he opposed the<lb/> march of Pharaoh Necho&#39;s army against the Assyrians&#44; was<lb/> the herald of the nation&#39;s fall.  Well might Jeremiah&#44;<lb/> the plaintive bard of Israel mourn over the event.  He O bewail the demise of personified Righteousness.<lb/>  He could see the fatal consequences of that event looming at a distance high.<lb/>   And how he&#44; the devoted patriot&#44; strove to mitigate&#44; at least&#44;<lb/> the evils arising form foreign subjugation&#44; and to prevent<lb/> the horrors of war&#44; and a protracted exile&#44; none that have a heart to feel can read without tears and weep not.<lb/></p>

            <p>Already <sic>Twenty</sic> three years&#44; he exclaimed &#34;I have I already been speaking to<lb/> you early and late&#44; but you would not listen&#34;......&#34;I said&#44;<lb/> pray turn away&#44; I pray&#44; each of you from his evil way course and wrong doing&#44;<lb/> and stay that you may abide in the land&#44; which the Lord gave unto you and your<lb/> fathers.&#34;  &#182; But Joachaz the son of Josiah&#44; madly rushed<lb/> into the arms of destruction.  Bent upon oppressing<lb/> his subjects&#44; he may have very possibly have so alienated their latter affection&#44; that<lb/> tey did not offer sufficient resistance against the army of<lb/> Necho.  They may have even welcomed the change&#44; which<lb/> the King of Egypt imposed upon them.  For having<lb/> carried Joachaz captive&#44; after the short reign of three months&#44;<lb/> he replaced the deposed ruler by an older brother.<lb/>  But it was a change&#44; not an improvement.  Joachim<lb/> <sic>yeilded</sic> himself to vice and sin.  He turned the capital<lb/> of his kingdom into a hot&#45;bed of depravity.  No one dared&#44;<lb/> without jeopardizing his life&#44; to raise a voice against<lb/> the enormities committed.  A prophet&#44; Uriah by name&#44;<lb/> whose lips condemned what his noble nature hated&#44; was<lb/> brought back from Egypt&#44; whither he had fled&#44; and<lb/> executed.  Jeremiah&#44; the type of the man he dolefully mournfully<lb/> describes in the third chapter of the book of lamentations&#44; of the<lb/> him man that gives his <sic>cheecks</sic> to the striker smiter&#44; and who is filled with contempt&#59;<lb/></p>

            <p>Jeremiah <sic>buffetted</sic> and cursed&#44; cast into the mire and<lb/> imprisoned&#44; still excited an reverential awe&#44; undefinable dread.  Neither<lb/> the iniquitous Jajachim&#44; nor his wily successor Zedekiah<lb/> found courage to put him to death. silence him by with a stroke of the sword.  He lived to witness<lb/> in all its horror terrific truth&#44; the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of what Isaiah had predicted&#44;<lb/> and he himself had tried striven in vain to avert or to temper down alleviate.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#182; Observe my hearers&#33; the scene has been shifted by an invisible hand.  It is not<lb/> Assyria that boastingly exclaims &#34;I can reach with my<lb/> numerous chariots the sides of the summit of Lebanon&#44; and hue down<lb/> its loftiest cedars.&#34;  It is not Nor is it Egypt that imperiously<lb/> cries &#34;Come up ye horses steeds&#44; raise a maddening noise ye chariots&#44;<lb/> let the mighty men advance &#44;the Ethiopians and the Lybians<lb/> who seize don grasp the shiled&#44; the Lydians&#44; that skilfully handle the<lb/> bow&#34;.....will destroy a city and those who dwell therein&#34;.<lb/>  Both powers have been shorn of their glory.  The allied armies<lb/> of Nabopolassar the Chaldean&#44; and of Darius&#44; or Cyascares&#44;<lb/> of Media have entered the famous Nineveh and brought it low razed it to the ground.  And<lb/> at Carchemith&#44; or Circaeium by the Euphrates&#44; the mis&#45;<lb/>tress of the Nile&#44; outwitted and routed had was constrained to renounce<lb/> her <sic>pretentions</sic> on Palestine.

            <p>A heavy tribute must be paid&#44; or the enfeebled nation<lb/> must bristle up and fight the foreigner to the bitter<lb/> end.  The &#91;&#63;&#93;&#45;hearted Jojachim promises to surrender his independence&#44;<lb/> and forward the annual impost to the city of prodigious walls&#59; but straining his looks for<lb/> the assistance of Egyptian horses and chariots and warriors expected&#44; he soon<lb/> plays false.  Jeremiah exhorts to fidelity.  He is jeered<lb/> at.  &#34;No fidelity needs be kept to the a detested foe.&#34;  The<lb/> prophet points with unerring finger to the two&#45;edged sword hanging<lb/> over the head of the whole nation.  He is branded with the<lb/> stigma of disloyalty.  &#34;That sword will yet be shattered<lb/> into fragments.&#34;  Eleven years of an storing <sic>ignominous</sic> reign<lb/> terminate with the death of the king&#44; whose profligacy<lb/> and dishonesty have dragged the country to the verge of<lb/> ruin. a precipice.  Happy he that dies is summoned hence before the giant of the<lb/> North has girded his loins.  For&#44; the son of Jojachim<lb/> has scarcely mounted the throne&#44; when Nebuchadnezzar<lb/> tears him away and chains his body into a Babylonian<lb/> prison.&#34;  As I live&#44; saith the Lord&#44; though Coniah the son<lb/> of Jojakim King of Judah were the signet upon my right&#45;<lb/>hand&#44; yet would I pluck him thence.&#34;.....&#34;O land&#44; O land&#44;<lb/> O land&#44; hear the word of the Lord.&#34;.....&#34;Write ye this man for as<lb/> a desolate being&#44; a man that can never prosper..&#34;.<lb/></p>

            <p>Zedekiah recorded in Holy Writ as the last king<lb/> of Judah&#44; would not have been so reckoned&#44; but for his<lb/> judgment which was glaringly weak&#44; and for his will which<lb/> was exceedingly wicked.  Having received his royal ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pointment as a gift from the mighty Ruler of Chaldea&#44;<lb/> he should not have broken faith.  He should ought to have<lb/> exercised his authority&#45;&#45;that shadowy authority still left&#45;&#45;&#44;<lb/> to collect the tax and forward the stipulated sum to the redeem his pledge.<lb/> exactor  But the rich smarting under the demand<lb/> for large contributions&#44; advised <sic>counselled</sic> rebellion&#59; fulsome courtiers&#44;<lb/> assuming the garb of prophets&#44; predicted a splendid<lb/> future to Judah&#44; when Ophrah&#44; who weilded the sceptre<lb/> in Mizraim&#44; would furrow the Mediterranean waves sea and bring<lb/> across his <sic>redoutable</sic> cavalry host.

            <p>If there is aught that can redeem atone&#44; in a measure for the<lb/> culpable folly of the last King of Judah and his mis&#45;<lb/>&#45;guided subjects&#44; it is the heroic resistance offered&#59; that<lb/> superhuman effort to force the assailant back by<lb/> enduring hunger and thirst rather than unfasten with <sic>darstardly</sic> hand the<lb/> gates through which he might make his victorious<lb/> entry.  If there is aught that can atone for expiate for the sins<lb/> of Zedekiah and his ill&#45;advisers&#44; it is the shocking death<lb/> they suffered.  For the princes of Judah were butchered<lb/> at Reblah&#45;&#45;&#44; a town where the general of the invaders held<lb/> his seat &#91;&#63;&#93; stallion&#45;&#45;and their king &#40;horrible to recount&#33;&#41; had the<lb/> sight of those eyes&#44; which were first made compelled to see&#44; the slaughter of the<lb/> royal household&#44; cruelly put out. and he was left In<lb/> that pitiable condition state was he left long to pine away in a prison cell in the dreariness of a dungeon.<lb/>  The land of promise had now&#44; literally&#45;&#45;as the great she&#45;<lb/>&#45;herd of Israel told it who had stood on the top of Sinai told it ages before&#44; cast out her inhabitants because<lb/> of their defilements.  A very small residue in a very lowly<lb/> condition was allowed to remain&#44; under the vigilance of a governor chosen<lb/> by the Babylonians.  Jeremiah the large&#45;hearted patriot&#45;&#45;<lb/> chose very unlike the Jewish polished but selfish &#91;&#63;&#93; of the second captivity dispersion of Israel&#45;&#45;preferred privations on his native soil&#44; rather than to the en&#45;<lb/>joyment of proferred honors in a foreign country.<lb/></p>

He that has given vent to it now disappears.  History<lb/> is silent touching the end of that hero of the olden faith.  Tra&#45;<lb/>&#45;dition does not point to the grave which has mouldered into dust<lb/> that heart ever&#45;throbbing with love for a Law despised and trampled on.<lb/>  But a residue of his disciples exist&#44; who have embalmed the Seer<lb/> in their tenderest thoughts.  Annually they undertake a pilgrimage.<lb/>  Upon the recurrence of the inauspicious ninth of Ab&#44; on which Jere&#45;<lb/>&#45;miah beheld the Sanctuary&#44; where the Divinity hovered above the Che&#45;<lb/>&#45;rubim&#44; a prey to devouring flames&#44; they bend low to listen to his plaintive<lb/> strains.  When they hear how through all tribulations the mercies of<lb/> the Lord to Israel have been unending&#44; they feel that the consolatory words are<lb/> a newly received message from the Sacerdotal Bard of Anathoth to<lb/> to the tribes he p reproved&#44; but for whom he yearned with all the depth of his great soul.<lb/></p>

            <p>Yes&#44; O Israelites&#33; dear coreligionists&#33;  The loving&#45;kindness of God has<lb/> been <sic>marvellously</sic> exhibited in the captivity of His chosen<lb/> witnesses&#44; not less than in their deliverance from thraldom.<lb/>  It became essential for the stability of Mosaism among<lb/> its heirs&#44; and for the <sic>developping</sic> of the principles destined<lb/> to permeate society&#44; that Judah should be plucked off<lb/> from whence it was first rooted in&#44; and be transplanted into<lb/> a foreign soil.  The atmosphere in which the moral life<lb/> of Judah breathed&#44; had become tainted with pestilential in&#45;<lb/>&#45;fluences.  Polytheism and its disintegrating organs&#44; were<lb/> busy at work to put out extinguish that existence.  True&#58; Babylon<lb/> also reeked with the fumes of oblations poured out at the<lb/> shrine of false deities&#44; but the exiles many among the captives turned away&#44; not to<lb/> inhale the air which wafted no longer the <sic>frangrance</sic><lb/> of Carmel and Lebanon.  They sought the solitary banks where<lb/> the Euphrates and the Tigris lay flowed&#44; and upon the weep&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing willows they hung the harp&#44; whose strings once responded<lb/> to the songs of Zion.<lb/></p>
            <p>The lapse of time&#44; which intervened between the first disper&#45;<lb/>&#45;sion and the restoration had not had a Josephus.  It is an historical<lb/> gap&#44; waiting for an able hand which can fill it.<lb/></p>

            <p>The Association that has assigned to me that task&#44;<lb/> has greatly overrated my capacities.  I cannot throw<lb/> any light upon that point.  I have diligently con&#45;<lb/>&#45;sulted authors within my reach&#44; but I have learnt nothing<lb/> positive&#44; nothing deserving to be presented as facts&#44; be&#45;<lb/>&#45;cause bearing the signet of truth seal of an incontestable authority.  It may&#44; however&#44; be<lb/> deduced from the writings of Ezekiel&#44; who probably was<lb/> taken young to Babylon and who lived and died there&#44; that<lb/> the captives exiles were allowed certain districts to dwell in&#44;<lb/> that they were governed by their own laws&#44; that their<lb/> chiefs and elders did not always set an example of piety&#44;<lb/> but that the teachings of the fearless Seer and his bold<lb/> oratory must have created an healthful impression.  It can<lb/> scarcely be disputed&#44; at all events&#44; that Chaldea was the<lb/> laboratory set apart by the Almighty Artificer to<lb/> remould the minds of corrupt Judah.  There&#44; was ido&#45;<lb/>&#45;latry against at which Jeremiah had <sic>levelled</sic>&#44; to no purpose&#44; the fire of<lb/> his inspired eloquence&#44; finally melted.  Without<lb/> instancing what is related of Daniel and his three asso&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciates&#44; it is evident that the bulk of the population<lb/> of Judeans&#44; grown to be very quite numerous&#44; was being weaned<lb/> away from polytheism&#44; and won over to the Monotheistic idea&#44;<lb/> which is the central pillar of the religion of Moses.<lb/></p>

Still Babylon was confessedly a school<lb/> of lasting reformation&#44; Babylon the flatterer seemingly &#91;&#63;&#93; pseudo friend of Judah&#44;<lb/> Babylon the destroyer of Judah&#44; was made by the<lb/> invisible Ruler of human events to effect His will in<lb/> Israel&#44; and through Israel in the world at large.<lb/>  The question But not in the Babylon under the dynasty<lb/> of that Sovereign&#44; who walking through a majestic<lb/> palace&#44; applauded his own might prowess and glory&#44; was the<lb/> working of a potent Judaism manifested.  The<lb/> race of Nebuchadnezzar made room  for another&#44; more<lb/> in sympathy with the creeds enunciated by Mosaism.<lb/></p>

            <p>At Belshazzar&#39;s impious banquet the feat went forth.  The<lb/> idols of Babylon&#44; will e cast to the moles and to the bats.<lb/>  Fire&#45;worship&#44; symbolic of an all&#45;vivifying Spirit&#44; said<lb/> to have been followed in Media and Persia at an early<lb/> date&#45;&#45;&#44; was a marked improvement on the deification of<lb/> nature material sensual objects.  Cyrus&#44; who after the death of Cyascares the<lb/> second&#44; or Darius&#44; his uncle and father&#45;in&#45;law&#44; placed<lb/> upon his head a double crown&#44; may have discovered<lb/> some analogy between his belief and that of his Judean<lb/> subjects.  He may have been shown by the latter&#44; the<lb/> passage in Holy Writ&#44; which announced the rising<lb/> of the Eastern Conqueror before whom Bel and Nebo&#44; the<lb/> idols deities of the Chaldeans would crouch.  He may have<lb/> felt exalted on seeing his name adorned with the title<lb/> of Messiah&#44; the Restorer of the house of the uncreated<lb/> spirit&#44; and the Deliverer of men who adored One Eternal<lb/> God.  We are too far from the time&#44; to judge with<lb/> precision&#44; touching the motives which led Cyrus to issue<lb/> his famous edict.  But the circumstance that scarcely<lb/> fifty thousand of those for whom it was issued&#44; in whose behalf it had been promulgated&#44; availed themselves of it&#44; has a significance.<lb/>  It brings home to forces the conviction upon the mind the conviction that the<lb/> Perso&#45;Medican King gave early evidences of favoring<lb/> the immense Jewish population scattered through<lb/> his empire&#44; and that they was on their part&#44; were loth to change habitation.<lb/></p>

            <p>Hence we read that when the chiefs of Judah and<lb/> Benjamin&#44; and the Priests and Levites&#44; together with all who<lb/> felt disposed to take possession again to the ancient<lb/> heritage&#44; entered into arrangements to that effect&#44; they<lb/> were supplied with silver and gold and voluntary offerings<lb/> for the future sanctuary by those around&#44; whom I understand<lb/> to be the Hebrews of settled in various localities.  Gladly they parted<lb/> with some of their substance to promote a righteous object&#44;<lb/> but the liberal sentiments of the new Ruler&#44; had inspired the<lb/> hope that the land of exile would offer them rest&#44; and the free<lb/> exercise of the religion endeared by trials&#44; therefore and there and in the midst of that<lb/> transformed Babylon would they cast their lot.  I advance it as my own<lb/> opinion&#45;&#45;and let it be considered as such&#59;&#45;&#45;I hold that the aged among<lb/> the Judean Community&#44; who still longed to revisit the sacred spot they<lb/> had stood upon in their childhood&#44; kindled up aroused the enthusiasm&#44; which<lb/> urged a portion of their younger brethren to undertake a fatiguing distant journey<lb/> and the difficult arduous mission of raising the Temple from its ruins.<lb/>  I fancy that I am supported in my theory by the Scriptural<lb/> sentence which says that &#34;many of the priests and Levites<lb/> and chiefs of the families&#44; the old people &#91;Hebrew&#93; Hazzekenen who had seen the<lb/> first house&#59; when the foundation of this house was laid before<lb/> their eyes&#45;&#45;wept with a loud voice.&#34;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="19"/>
            <p>And I am farther sustained by a chronology which<lb/> makes Jeshua the priest&#44; and makes Zerubabel the prince of Judah&#44;<lb/> and beyond question Jeshua the priest&#44; the immediate descendants of the parents whom Nebucadnez&#45;<lb/>&#45;zar had transported to Babylon.<lb/></p>
            <p>But of those two illustrious personages&#44; had passed a stage<lb/> of life&#44; in which bodily vigour is revealed in an un&#45;<lb/>&#45;bending form&#44; they evinced no sign of decrepitude.<lb/>  Strong they were in the will to resist obstacles&#44; and to<lb/> bring the whole force of their moral character to bear<lb/> upon the work of reconstruction.  Palestine&#44; though<lb/> formerly a dependency of Babylon&#44; submitted&#44; no doubt&#44; to<lb/> the Persian victor&#44; and the Judeans did not experience much<lb/> difficulty in establishing their claims to its possession.<lb/>  But neighboring tribes looked&#44; with jealousy&#44; upon the return<lb/> of the exiles.  From the hour that the leaders had rallied<lb/> the adherents of the Mosaic legislation round a common<lb/> altar&#44; hostilities began.  Harassed and distracted in<lb/> their endeavours&#44; Zerubabel and Jeshua still labored<lb/> for the realization for the promotion of the national project cause.  Shortly<lb/> after their arrival&#44; they convened a general assembly<lb/> in a provisionary Tabernacle&#44; and enforced obedience to<lb/> the laws&#44; by the observance of the solemn festivals which occur in<lb/> Tishri.<lb/></p>

            <p>They set about preparing materials for the re&#45;edi&#45;<lb/>&#45;fication of the Temple&#44; and in the month of Heshvan of the<lb/> following year&#44; was the corner stone thereof laid at the sound<lb/> of music&#44; and psalmody.<lb/></p>
            <p>Here&#44; with your permission&#44; I stop.  Not because the task<lb/> assigned to me is&#44; by any means&#44; complete&#44; but because to<lb/> proceed farther would be to enter a <sic>feild</sic> of literature vast and<lb/> rich&#44; from which I could not gather a single flower&#44; without<lb/> wrongfully depriving you of much that my reason and feelings<lb/> urge me to offer.  For&#44; to speak becomingly of the Haggai and<lb/> Neheme Zechariah&#44; of Ezra and Nehemiah&#44; of the stirring times and events<lb/> and adversities they shaped into a noble end&#59; to point to that con&#45;<lb/>stellation of human excellencies&#45;&#45;the men of the Great Synod&#45;&#45;<lb/> from whom we obtained the unquenchable light&#44; which illu&#45;<lb/>&#45;mined the path of Israel in the gloomiest days of persecution&#44;<lb/> and which will ever shed its splendor around us&#59; to fittingly<lb/> relate&#44; I say&#44; what we owe our immortal predecessors&#44; whom<lb/> the Talmud declares to have restored to the religion of the<lb/> Hebrews its priceless diadem&#44; would be to describe the <sic>de&#45;<lb/>velopping</sic> of ideas inherent in Judaism&#44; but mirrored in<lb/> institutions most wise and supremely beneficial.  In a<lb/> word&#58; it would be to delineate the history of the traditions&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>which have breathed into us a new and never&#45;dying<lb/> existence.<lb/></p>
            <p>But as I am addressing an Association&#44; that has taken the<lb/> initiative towards carrying out an object&#44; which our good<lb/> preceptors of old&#44; considered of vital importance&#44; I must ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;hibit to view the latent power by which a lasting reform&#45;<lb/>&#45;ation was effected in the days of the worthies just mentioned.<lb/>  Jeremiah spent all the energies of his soul&#59; all the glowing<lb/> spirit of prophecy&#44; in endeavouring to convince his contempo&#45;<lb/>&#45;raries that Idolatry is folly&#59; that Immorality is dangerous.<lb/>  He did not succeed.  But before a century had glided by<lb/> since the patriot had so preached&#44; a generation had arisen&#44;<lb/> that not alone had discarded Polytheism and its debasing<lb/> incitements&#44; but that was ready to stake life and substance for<lb/> the sake of God&#39;s Unity and the Prophet&#39;s pure teachings.<lb/>  What had created a change so wonderful&#63;  Schools and<lb/> Synagogues&#44; O Israelites&#33; two institutions&#44; which I&#44; using a<lb/> homely metaphor&#44; call the two sinewy arms wherewith Ju&#45;<lb/>daism works for its living&#44; and deprived of which it must<lb/> die of starvation.  Schools and Synagogues must have<lb/> seen their first dawn in Babylon.  Not schools of<lb/> prophets for an intellectual Aristocracy&#59; not a central<lb/></p>

            <p>place of worship with its imposing grandeur of<lb/> Priestly vestures and Levitish choruses for an occasional<lb/> national convocation of national character&#59; but popular establishments&#44; where<lb/> young and old&#44; the grand sire and the matron could go<lb/> with frequency and there be inspirited to fight the seduct&#45;<lb/>&#45;ions which gentilism offered.<lb/></p>
            <p>Without admitting in all particulars&#44; the Rabbincial legend&#45;<lb/>&#45;ary respecting the house of prayer&#44; set up by the son of<lb/> King Jojachim and his fellow&#45;captives&#44; and about the col&#45;<lb/>&#45;lege of Ezra that stood close by it&#44; we may perceive in<lb/> the fervor of the fifty thousand who returned to the holy<lb/> land&#44; and in their assent to the measures adopted by the<lb/> noble scribe at their head&#44; the influences of religious culture<lb/> more diffused than in former ages.  And thus it is that the<lb/> Association I have the honor to address must further with<lb/> assiduity.  We Israelites are not so Puritanic as to exlu<lb/> exclude light diversions&#44; as the temptations of a spirit of dark&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness.  We are allowed&#44; and even encouraged to gratify our<lb/> feelings&#44; while enlightening our minds&#44; but we cannot be<lb/> true to our faith&#44; true to ourselves&#44; if we make the<lb/> knowledge of Jewish history&#44; and literature secondary<lb/> to the pleasures of the hour.<lb/></p>

            <p>I judge it to be the principal mission of such<lb/> organizations as this&#44; to breed a race of Jews&#44; who<lb/> will acquire by serious studies&#44; by a thorough un&#45;<lb/>&#45;derstanding of the stages through which Judaism<lb/> has passed to be cleansed from the dross with which<lb/> heathenism tarnished its splendour&#44; a race of Jews<lb/> who will acquire by sacred learning a loftier conception<lb/> of their duty to mankind even now&#44; as God&#39;s chosen<lb/> apostles of Truth.  And I watch with lively<lb/> interest the doings of the Young Men&#39;s Hebrew<lb/> Association of Philadelphia.  I hail the intro&#45;<lb/>&#45;duction of instructive lectures&#44; and I thank my<lb/> Brethren for the patient hearing they have accorded granted<lb/> me this evening.<lb/></p>
