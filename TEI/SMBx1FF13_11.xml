            <p>Richmond December 7 1856<lb/>
                My Dear Mr Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>Your kind favor enclosing note to Mr &#38; Mrs<lb/> Levy &#38; also the papers are to hand.  Your discourse<lb/> is much admired and acknowledged by all to be<lb/> excellent and very appropriate to the occasion<lb/></p>
            <p>I perceive<lb/> you have <del>you have</del> touched upon the recent political<lb/> agitations of this county just sufficiently to make<lb/> it interesting&#44; the allusions are beautiful I<lb/> wish I were competent to comment upon many<lb/> parts&#44; that are highly engaging.<lb/></p>
            <p>You have doubtless received<lb/> both my letters.  I have often regretted having troubled<lb/> you with our domestic difficulties&#44; but was so worried as to<lb/> be actuated by momentary impulses had I deferred until<lb/> next day&#44; it would not have been done&#44; as I am<lb/> aware that matters of such a nature&#44; laid open to<lb/> a third party&#44; are never improved&#44; and only tend<lb/> to create an unpleasant feeling towards one without<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p><sic>benefitting</sic> the others  If you have not done so&#44; do not<lb/> see Mr Heiter&#44; as I feel justly indignant towards<lb/> him for his conduct to Levy&#44; let the faults of the latter<lb/> be what they may&#44; it was the duty of Mr H. to notify him<lb/> especially as he urged him so strenuously to leave a situation<lb/> where he would have acquired a thorough knowledge of book&#45;<lb/>keeping&#44; if the salary was not quite so large&#44; he would at least<lb/> have had a recommendation&#44; But as you often say &#40;He is a<lb/> <sic>german</sic> <del>assistant</del>&#41; you will either send Levys letter to<lb/> me by mail&#44; or burn it&#44; as I do not care again<lb/> to see that uninteresting document&#44; it caused me<lb/> much sorrow.  I am not posted up on the events<lb/> of the day&#44; further than Mr Leeser was at synagogue&#44;<lb/> which of course was a matter of surprise&#44; and I<lb/> feel exceedingly anxious to know what induced<lb/> his visit&#44; has any thing transpired in congregational<lb/> affairs since that momentous event&#44; what are the signs of<lb/> the times&#44; I am anxious to know for your sake.<lb/>  Mr Jacobs book was received at New York on the Sabbath<lb/> when he was from home&#44; it is safe however at Mr Hymans<lb/> he thanks you for your attention and desires kind regards.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>The approaching wedding ought indeed <del>to</del> contribute to my<lb/> cheerfulness.  In fact many other causes should have that effect&#44;<lb/> There is in my immediate circle a continual round of<lb/> enjoyment.  Our home is a Schrivers&#44; but all seem to<lb/> claim a right and between them I am seldom at<lb/> home would that I could be as they.<lb/></p>
            <p>My Sisters house<lb/> is frequented by all respectable Israelites who visit this city<lb/> I do not wonder at it&#44; as the whole family are<lb/> exceedingly agreeable&#44; some of them sing &#38; play well.<lb/>  They occasionally have private Theatrical performances&#44; at their house&#44;<lb/> and in short&#44; they deny their children nothing reason<lb/>able that conduces to their happiness.  I have succeed<lb/>&#45;ed in effecting a reconciliation between the families<lb/> of my sister and brother&#44; which is a source of much<lb/> gratification to many.<lb/></p>
            <p>Mr Jacobs delivered a very<lb/> good discourse yesterday&#44; from the 38 Chap 8 verse Exodus<lb/> I was <del>much</del> pleased&#44; but thought it rather prosg.&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>How are the<lb/> Finsis and other friends.  Poor Rachel Pisoa is gone<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>she will certainly be missed by many.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am expecting<lb/> Levy to day and naturally feel anxious until he<lb/> will have arrived.  Present my love to Clara&#44; <del>and</del><lb/> kiss her and the dear Nina for me.  Offer my regards<lb/> <del>also</del> to Miss Finsi and family to Miss Weil &#38; family<lb/> and accept the best wishes for the health and<lb/> happiness of yourself and family from<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours Sincerely<lb/>
                Adeline Hyneman<lb/>
                Rebecca and Family my sister &#38; Brothers<lb/> <del>families</del> Mailerts and all friends desire<lb/> kind regards&#44; and regret you cannot<lb/> be with us on Wednesday next<lb/>
