            <p>No 2 California St<lb/></p>
            <p>San Francisco March 7 1894<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. Dr. S. Morais<lb/>
                My dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>A letter from an old old acquaintance<lb/> from whom you have not heard for a very long<lb/> time will take you by surprise&#44; no doubt.  I have<lb/> now and then read about you in the papers as<lb/> you are thank God &#91;Hebrew&#93; and as you are a public<lb/> man.  I have in a moral sense passed from the world&#44;<lb/> though I am by the will of Providence&#44; and malgr&#233;<lb/> moi obliged to remain in it.  When I write to you<lb/> it involuntarily reminds me of our first meeting<lb/> in Philadelphia&#44; when you and I were candidates<lb/> for the position which you have so faithfully held<lb/> for forty&#45;three years&#44; while I have been a real wan&#45;<lb/>dering Jew&#44; having crossed the oceans about 20 times<lb/> and yet......I have on former occasions<lb/> quoted to you the saying &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> and this&#44; alas&#33; is still applicable to me&#44; but instead<lb/> of &#91;Hebrew&#93; it is &#91;Hebrew&#93; as you will see.  Now&#44; any<lb/> good old friend&#44; to come to the point and purpose<lb/> which induced me again &#91;Hebrew&#93; I must relate to you<lb/> the circumstances that lead me to do so.<lb/></p>
            <p>You know that I held a position in Denver Col. for<lb/> a number of years.  I might have continued at my<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>post&#44; but having passed the 70 I had to retire<lb/> to make room for younger powers.  I had in the<lb/> long course of my career gathered a few thousands&#44;<lb/> and these I invested in real estate&#44; as Denver was<lb/> then flourishing&#44; booming as it is called.  The revenue<lb/> from my property was not large&#44; but sufficient to<lb/> keep me comfortable&#44; as I thought for the rest of my<lb/> days&#59; so I retired to my native country where I could<lb/> do more with my limited income than I could in Ame&#45;<lb/>rica.  Shortly after my departure&#44; however&#44; there was<lb/> already a falling off in the value of real property<lb/> and consequently in rents&#44; and when the silver<lb/> prime set in&#44; the metal depreciated&#44; and the mines<lb/> closed my rents gradually decreased until at last<lb/> they were insufficient to pay the mortgage interest&#44;<lb/> taxes&#44; repairs and other expenses and I was obliged<lb/> to make an assignment of the property to my<lb/> agent to whom I was already indebted for<lb/> several hundred dollars.  In this deplorable<lb/> condition I find myself now&#44; my Rev. old friend&#44;<lb/> at the age of 76&#44; without property&#44; capital or po&#45;<lb/>sition&#44; without any resources whatever&#44; too old to<lb/> look for another engagement&#44; actually reduced to<lb/> beggary&#44; and yet I cannot beg&#44; I cannot if my<lb/> very life depend on it.  While in Holland I<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>could not keep up household expenses and was<lb/> obliged to part with good wife for the time&#44;<lb/> leaving her in care of a sister&#44; while I sold my<lb/> furniture and books to pay my <sic>travelling</sic> expenses<lb/> back to this country where I expected to find a<lb/> home with my son&#44; but times are hard&#44; business<lb/> is bad&#44; and he is not able to give me half nor<lb/> one third of what I absolutely need.  In this<lb/> <sic>embarassing</sic> condition what am I to do&#63;  On whom<lb/> to call for help.  Next to my relatives&#44; I think&#44; are<lb/> my brethren in the ministry.  I have a number<lb/> of acquaintances among them.  If each would<lb/> contribute a trifle for my support I could get<lb/> along.  I do not need much.  &#36;30 a month would<lb/> be sufficient for my wife and self.  If each would<lb/> kindly contribute say one dollar <hi rend="underline">monthly</hi> I would<lb/> be thankful.  From Dr. Pereira Mendes I have<lb/> received some encouraging words and a little mo&#45;<lb/>ney.  He said he brought my appeal before the New<lb/> York Board of Ministers and they expressed much<lb/> sympathy.  Perhaps you could do the same and<lb/> thus aid in procuring for me the necessary amount<lb/> for my living.  However little it may be will be<lb/> thankfully accepted.  I think it hardly neces&#45;<lb/>sary&#44; my friend&#44; to apologize for the liberty<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I take in asking from you the favor.  I know you<lb/> too well&#44; and feel assured that you will for me<lb/> what you can.  I close this &#91;Hebrew&#93; trusting<lb/> that it will find you and yours in the full<lb/> engagement of health and peace&#44; and anxiously<lb/> awaiting your answer I remain<lb/> yours very truly<lb/> J. Mendes de Solla.<lb/></p>
