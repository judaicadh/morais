            <p>A tribute to the memory of L. Sulzberger.<lb/></p>
            <p>If it is very true of that the practice of pronouncing a eulogy over the dead&#44;<lb/> would generally be more honored in the breach then in the observance&#44;<lb/> the present instance offers nevertheless a bright striking exception.  I do not<lb/> remember in the whole course of my ministry&#44; a case in which a<lb/> panegyric was more deservedly bestowed than it would be now.  I have<lb/> certainly buried members of our faith more distinguished&#44; more learned&#44; more useful members perhaps<lb/> of our faith&#44; and of to ourselves and to the community among whom we live&#44; but none<lb/> sincerer in piety&#44; humble gentler in feelings&#44; firmer in the principles of<lb/> honesty humanity and rectitude than my the venerable friend whom&#44; to my sorrow&#44;<lb/> I am about to lay into the grave.  Yet&#44; notwithstanding the<lb/> sterling merits which I have had abundant cause occasion to admire in the deceased&#44;<lb/> I am compelled to withhold all praise a due measure of praise.  First&#58; the joyful Tabernacle&#45;holi&#45;<lb/>&#45;day which Israelites celebrate this week&#44; forbids outward expressions and<lb/> signs of private affliction mourning&#59; secondly&#44; I am restrained by the wish of the<lb/> sainted dead.  Often in our long intercourse&#44; he deprecated funeral orations&#44;<lb/> apt as they are to degenerate with fulsome laudations.  As to himself&#59;<lb/> he had always lived in unostentatious simplicity&#44; so would he also prefer<lb/> that his burial be quietly perfectly plain.  And that which I learned drew from<lb/> his own lips&#44; his oldest son has confirmed.  We Israelites Hebrews are<lb/> taught to respect the will of the departed in whatever does not con&#45;<lb/>&#45;flict with the prescribed laws.  I dare not therefore trespass.<lb/>  But the melancholy satisfaction of which I am deprived at this hour&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>will he be gratified at another time and in another place.  I must<lb/> let this sad opportunity show tell why the gradual loss of a class of men&#44; alas&#33; so<lb/> reduced in number&#44; but among whom Leopold Sulzberger ranked foremost&#44; is a very<lb/> serious loss.  I must instruct a congregation by the sterling excellent qualities<lb/> of him who has gone from its midst.  Fortunately&#44; in the<lb/> present instance&#44; the bereaved family does not need words of advice and<lb/> consolation exhortation.  The life of the husband and the father has been<lb/> a lesson leading to practical righteousness and inspiring <sic> abinding</sic> hope in God&#39;s mercy.<lb/>  And when the pain of the separation&#44; naturally very keen&#44; despite<lb/> the ripe age of my friend&#44; shall have been relieved by the hand<lb/> of time&#44; the good name&#44; sweeter than precious out ointment&#44; left<lb/> behind by the deceased&#44; will prove a lasting comfort to the surviving relatives.  But the<lb/> Israelites whom he benefitted by bereft of his example must hear&#44; more publicly<lb/> than to day&#44; a rehearsal of the virtues of their old official.  So that<lb/> my people remembering them for their having been set forth conspicuously&#44; they my people may<lb/> repeat them to the children and young.  Aye&#58; the growing generation may should be taught to value<lb/> a religion of probity&#44; so clearly illustrated by our brother&#44; whose<lb/> soul has been called to the enjoyment of an everlasting<lb/> reward &#91;Hebrew&#93; even to the realms of bliss.  &#34;to walk before God<lb/> at the light of an imperishable life.&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
