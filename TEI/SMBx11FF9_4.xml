            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Under ordinary circumstances&#44; it is difficult to deliver<lb/> a funeral address without falling into exaggerations&#44;<lb/> and say things which are not strictly correct&#59; that is&#44; give<lb/> utterance to what savors of flattery&#44; or unintentionally<lb/> does the departed injustice.  This difficulty increases very<lb/> considerably&#44; when the speaker has no knowledge of<lb/> the character&#44; history and sentiments of the deceased&#44; who<lb/> is about to be buried.  In that weary position I my&#45;<lb/>&#45;self am placed this day.  Our sister in faith was a stranger<lb/> to me&#44; not a stranger of course&#44; in its literal sense&#44; for<lb/> she was a member of the faith religion which I am bound to<lb/> serve&#44; but as one whom I do not remember to have<lb/> met during her life&#45;time&#44; and learned to look upon as<lb/> she may have deserved to be regarded.  For I need<lb/> scarcely say that my presence here is due to the sad<lb/> circumstance&#44; that the minister of this Hebrew family<lb/> has died&#44; and I have agreed to act at the request of some<lb/> who mourn for the loss of this aged mother in Israel.<lb/></p>
            <p>But while I must be pardoned for not making<lb/> very extended remarks&#44; by reason of my unacquaintance<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>with the departed&#44; I am glad that I am enabled<lb/> to accord to her the merit of having been a consistent<lb/> Jewess.  So have I been assured by those who<lb/> claim to have known her well.  To some the qualities<lb/> I have just mentioned may appear of doubtful me&#45;<lb/>&#45;rit.  They might ask&#58; &#34;What virtue is there in<lb/> a person who professes a certain religion to adhere<lb/> to it&#63;  To be a Jew or a Jewess means to<lb/> follow Biblical and traditional ordinances without<lb/> deviation.&#34;  But as unfortunately the illustration<lb/> of such consistency is very rare at present&#44; therefore<lb/> when we find it&#44; we ought to praise it loudly<lb/> and greatly.  If it does not lie then in<lb/> my power to eulogise the character of Mrs.....in all<lb/> particulars and in detail&#44; I judge that my commend&#45;<lb/>ing her for her religiousness is&#44; nowadays&#44; a high<lb/> laudation.  Besides&#44; I hold that an individual<lb/> who keeps fidelity to God&#44; must necessarily<lb/> be faithful to her near and dear in every rela&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of life.  This venerable sister of ours could<lb/> not have observed her faith by half&#44; minding<lb/> the ceremonial rules&#44; and neglecting the moral injunctions.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>I must believe that besides attending to Sab&#45;<lb/>&#45;baths and festivals&#44; dietary laws and synagogual<lb/> rites&#44; she was a devoted wife&#44; and affectionate<lb/> mother and sincere friend&#59; for we cannot &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> the commandments by assigning to some more im&#45;<lb/>&#45;portance and validity than to others.  Brightly<lb/> have our Sages recommended that we be eager to ful&#45;<lb/>&#45;fil the light religious duties as the rigid ones&#44; for we are<lb/> ignorant of their respective recompense.  If Mrs<lb/>.....was a true Jewess&#44; her reward must be<lb/> very great in the regions of bliss.  But have<lb/> those to whom she behaved lovingly &#38; during<lb/> a long protracted existence&#44; repaid her according to her<lb/> worth&#63;  Has the husband been considerate and<lb/> kind&#44; and has he endeavoured to sweeten the life<lb/> of his companion&#63;  Have the children been<lb/> devoted to their mother&#44; have they solicitously<lb/> waited on her&#44; anticipated her by words&#63;  These<lb/> important questions may be answered by acquain&#45;<lb/>&#45;tances who have associated with the family&#44; and<lb/> have learned its habits&#44; feelings and practices.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I trust&#44; for their sake&#44; that the testimony is in<lb/> their favor.  I can only pray that their reward<lb/> be commensurate to their goodness.  I beseech<lb/> the Lord that they may feel experience the joy of having<lb/> carried out the principles of rectitude implanted<lb/> in our breasts by the Author of our existence&#44; and<lb/> ordained by the Lawgiver of Israel.  Thus will<lb/> they have in heaven a being propitiating divine<lb/> grace in their behalf.  As to the depart&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed&#44; whom her Maker permitted to reach a period<lb/> beyond the allotted term&#44; I offer supplications that<lb/> the trials which may have undergone be an atone&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment for all her shortcomings.  May the Father<lb/> of mercy bid his angels usher her soul into the<lb/> realms of beatitude&#44; and assign to her a seat<lb/> among the righteous and the saints who<lb/> have done His will.  May in her be verified the<lb/> sentence of the scriptures&#58; &#34;The Almighty shall be<lb/> the precious gold&#44; and powerful silver will He be to Thee.<lb/>  Then shalt thou delight in the Omnipotent and raise they face to God.<lb/>  Amen.<lb/></p>
