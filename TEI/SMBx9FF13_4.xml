            <p>Some explanatory remarks on<lb/>
                Parashat Itr&#243;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Dear Brethren&#33;  In the prefatory remarks of to my last address&#44;<lb/> I maintained&#44; that the opportunities of which a Jewish Minister can avail himself to afford religious instruc&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion&#44; beyond the limits of the Synagogue&#44; are&#44; for reasons al&#45; which<lb/> &#45;ready therein explained&#44; exceedingly rare.  But I did not presume<lb/> by that assertion to exclude the possibility of so desirable an<lb/> occurrence&#44; for&#44; my own social intercourse would bear testimony<lb/> against that presumption.  I have&#44; sometimes voluntarily&#44; at others fortuitously&#44;<lb/> exercised the privilege granted to my vocation&#44; and attained the<lb/> object prefixed in my mind.  In fact&#44; it is my design<lb/> that you should judge yourselves of my endeavours to succeed<lb/> in that respect&#44; by submitting to your mature reflection<lb/> a few strictures elected by a query propounded to me simply in<lb/> the course of conversation.  They are connected with that most<lb/> essential biblical passage we have perused this Sabbath.<lb/>  And although subsequently formed into an essay&#44; and illustrated<lb/> by appropriate quotations&#44; they are substantially the same<lb/> as they were colloquially imparted.  Lend me&#44; dear friends&#33;<lb/> your indulgent serious attention&#44; that you may dive into the<lb/> profound truths they are intended to unfold.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>The book of Ecclesiastes contains the following important ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;xim.  &#34;Be not with thy mouth&#44; nor let thy mind be<lb/> hasty to utter any thing concerning God&#44; for&#44; God is in<lb/> heaven and thou art upon earth&#44; let therefore thy words be<lb/> few&#34; I greatly apprehend that my efforts to elucidate a<lb/> theme in itself a very abstruse&#44; may occasion a contravention of<lb/> that salutary rule laid down by the wisest of men&#59; consequently<lb/> I will give utterance solely to that which I may deem necessary indispensable<lb/> in order to reconcile the idea of the incorporalityate of the Supreme with<lb/> the biblical passages which appear to contradict that verity&#59; and<lb/> especially with that which ascribes to Him the inscription of the<lb/> Decalogue.  That God is incorporeal&#44; both reason and<lb/> Holy Writ jointly teach us.  Reason tells us&#44; that whatever is<lb/> material&#44; is necessarily circumscribed within narrow limits&#44; and<lb/> liable also to continual alterations.  Now&#44; He who governs the whole<lb/> universe must needs be ubiquitary&#44; ergo God cannot be confined<lb/> within space.  He who has ever existed&#44; cannot be affected<lb/> by time&#44; ergo God is unchangeable.  Holy Writ likewise<lb/> repudiates the belief in God&#39;s corporeity&#59; firstly&#44; by<lb/></p>

            <p>emphatically charging Israel to be heedful lest they make<lb/> any image to represent the Deity&#44; for&#44; it says declares &#34;that on the day<lb/> He spoke in Horeb&#44; no form appeared to the assembled mul&#45;<lb/>&#45;titude &#40;Deut 4.15&#41; secondly&#44; by showing the impossibility<lb/> of portraying Him in any guise&#34; to whom can you liken<lb/> God&#44; and to what could you ever assimilate Him&#63; &#40;Isaiah 40.18&#41;<lb/> Thirdly&#44; by asserting his omnipresence &#34;Am I a God near at<lb/> hand&#44; but not from afar off&#63;  Can any one hide himself in<lb/> secret places that I shall not see him&#63;&#34; &#40;Jeremiah 23.23&#41;<lb/> fourthly&#44; by proclaiming his immutability &#34;For&#44; I the Lord have<lb/> never changed&#34; &#40;Malachi 3.6&#41;.  It then clearly ensues&#44; that<lb/> whenever the Scriptures apply to the Deity terms which denote<lb/> materiality&#44; they must be considered as words borrowed from<lb/> human language&#44; to suit human understanding.  Had&#44;<lb/> on the contrary&#44; superhuman expressions been employed&#44; to signify<lb/> the dealings of the Almighty with his creatures&#44; men&#44; who receive<lb/> all their impressions&#44; through the senses&#44; would have certainly<lb/> failed to unfold then purport.  For&#44; even the faculties of<lb/> the mind and of the soul&#44; mortal beings are constrained<lb/></p>

Now&#44; if such a contrivance<lb/> is indispensable in relation with the spiritual part of men&#44;<lb/>&#45;&#45;which is but a faint reflection of that pervad spirit which<lb/> pervades the universe&#45;&#45;how could they finite creatures have otherwise<lb/> conceived the actions of Him&#44; whose essence is unfathomable&#63;<lb/>  To reveal to teach us then what nature&#44; without revelation&#44; was incapable<lb/> to communicate&#44; namely&#44; the performance of good&#44; and the<lb/> eschewing of evil&#44; the law has needfully lowered the Most<lb/> High to the level of earthly beings&#44; and attributed to Him deeds<lb/> and qualities which appertain exclusively to the latter.<lb/>
                His providence is denoted by an all&#45;seeing&#45;eye &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Zechariah 4.10&#41;<lb/>  His mercy by an ever&#45;open ear &#40;Pslams 34.16&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93; he is said to be<lb/> ireful&#44; when He withdraws his blessing from sinners &#40;Deut 11.19&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> He is styled &#34;jealous&#34; when debasing idolatry estranges his in&#45;<lb/>&#45;telligent creatures from the worship due solely to Him &#40;Deut 32.16&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93; Oftentimes&#44; the<lb/> <sic>execusion</sic> of his will&#44; is signified by an issue of his mandate<lb/> or by his speech &#40;Psalms 33.6.9&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93;  When his interposition&#44; either<lb/> as a reward or as a chastisement to man&#44; is extraordinarily preternaturally visible&#44;<lb/></p>

Having hitherto briefly proved from reason &#38; Holy Writ that<lb/> God is incorporeal&#44; and that the biblical passages&#44; which at<lb/> first sight&#44; appear to gainsay that truth&#44; cannot be regarded<lb/> in a literal sense&#44; I shall proceed to solve the query arising which<lb/> from the delivery of the ten commandments&#44; and their<lb/> inscription upon the tables of stone&#44; give rise in our mind.<lb/>  I shall however preface my observations&#44; by stating that<lb/> whatever I may utter on this momentous topic&#44; will be<lb/> a mere hypothesis&#44; which I may succeed in substantiating&#44;<lb/> but which I would not dare to offer as an authority.<lb/></p>
            <p>When Moses recalls to the mind of Israel the appalling <sic>cir&#45;<lb/>&#45;circumstance</sic> of God&#39;s revelation upon Sinai&#44; he frequently<lb/> alludes to the fire that blazed on that hallowed mountain.  &#34;The<lb/> Lord spoke unto you in the midst of the fire &#34;His words thou didst hear from the midst of the fire&#34; &#40;Deut 4.36&#41; &#40;Deuto 4.12&#41;  &#34;These<lb/> words the Lord spoke to all your assembled multitude on<lb/> the mount from the midst of the fire&#34; &#40;Idem 5.22&#41; &#34;The ten<lb/> commandments which the Lord spoke to you on the<lb/></p>

            <p>mountain from the midst of the fire&#34; &#40;Idem 10.4&#41;  These and<lb/> similar sentences interspersed through the fifth book of the<lb/> Pentateuch have occasioned created the opinion entertained by sundry various authors&#44; that<lb/> each sound of the cornet&#44; emitted through the fire&#44; the words<lb/> which furnished the minds of the hearers with the sublime<lb/> ideas they conveyed.  God to whom nature is obedient&#44; bid the<lb/> air&#44; which issued from the loud instrument to shape itself<lb/> in such a form by which He might communicate his<lb/> will to the mortals.  But although Israel had previously<lb/> sanctified themselves for this awful advent&#44; they could not<lb/> long endure the divine manifestation.  It was too appalling terrific<lb/> to be witnessed by finite creatures &#34;And ye said&#44; behold the Lord<lb/> God hath showed us his glory and his greatness &#44;and we have<lb/> heard his voice out of the midst of the fire&#59; we have seen<lb/> this day&#44; that God doth talk with man&#44; and he liveth.  Now<lb/> therefore why should we die&#63; for this great fire will consume<lb/> us&#44; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more&#44; then<lb/> we shall die&#44; For who is there of all flesh&#44; that hath heard<lb/> the voice of the living God&#44; speaking out of the midst of<lb/> the fire&#44; as we have&#44; and lived&#63;&#34; &#40;Deut 5.24. 25.26&#41;&#92;And<lb/> the theory advanced&#44; would also explain a verse &#40;in Exodus 20.18&#41;<lb/> occurring in our Parasha<lb/></p>

            <p>which the authorized version has in all likelihood misinter&#45;<lb/>&#45;preted &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;And all the people saw the voices<lb/> &#40;not the thunders&#41; the flames&#44; the noise of the trumpet and<lb/> the smoking mountain&#34; for&#44; according to our rendering argument&#44; which is corroborated by the Hebrew text&#44; they<lb/> actually beheld the sound which unfolded to them&#44; already<lb/> elevated minds&#44; the basis of every religious and social duty.<lb/>  And the same truths which tended progressively to illumine all<lb/> the children of the same Eternal Father&#44; were twice in a wondrous<lb/> manner impressed upon two tables of stone.  Peculiarly<lb/> remarkable is the diction of Holy Writ touching the last&#45;named<lb/> communication.  It is said that the writing was the writing<lb/> of Elohim&#44; and by the finger of Elohim graven upon the<lb/> tables.  The word &#34;Elohim&#34; as it is familiarly known&#44;<lb/> is does not always stand as an appellation of the Deity&#44; but is likewise<lb/> with propriety applied to persons of distinction&#44; or to any thing object<lb/> imposingly great.  Of the former case we find&#44; &#34;Thou art a<lb/> prince of Elohim amongst us&#34; that is&#44; &#34;a mighty prince&#34; &#40;Gen 29.5&#41;<lb/> of the latter&#44; we meet &#34;And Nineveh was a vast city of<lb/> Elohim&#44;&#34; to wit&#45;&#45;&#34;an exceedingly large city.&#34; &#40;Jonah 3.3&#41; In addition<lb/> to our knowledge of this fact&#44; we must bear in<lb/></p>

            <p>mind&#44; that the term &#34;Haroot &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#34; rendered in the English<lb/> &#34;graven&#34; stands alone in the whole Bible&#44; and that we con&#45;<lb/>jecture its meaning merely by analogy with kindred words&#59;<lb/> so that even the construction and peculiarity of the verse which<lb/> records the incident under discussion&#44; justifys our saying&#44;<lb/> that as the azure vaults of heaven&#44; have been called by David&#34;<lb/> &#34;the work of the finger of God&#44;&#34; &#40;Psalms 8.4&#41; namely&#44; the effect of his<lb/> sovereign will&#44; so was the writing of Elohim&#45;&#45;that mar&#45;<lb/>velous writing&#44; <sic>marvellously</sic> imprinted upon the tables&#44;<lb/> through by the mere wish of Him&#44; who &#34;spoke and it was accomplished.&#34;<lb/></p>  
            <p>With the aforesaid observations I strove&#44; my dear Brethren&#33;<lb/> to satisfy the mind of an intelligent querist.  They are concise&#44;<lb/> but&#44; as I remembered the healthful aphorism of King Solomon&#44; I<lb/> judged them sufficient as an elucidation of a subject which is&#44;<lb/> after all&#44; above our reach&#44; for such is indeed the knowledge of<lb/> God&#44; of his attributes and actions.  But if nevertheless it is correct that<lb/> every Israelite should become the possessor of an enlightened reli&#45;<lb/>&#45;gious belief.  If it is desirable that every one who adheres to the<lb/> Mosaic code&#44; should endeavour to comprehend the sublime verities<lb/> wherewith it is replete&#44; still&#44; I confidently assert&#44; that the doctrines<lb/> continued in the Decalogue&#44; require not the outward support<lb/></p>
