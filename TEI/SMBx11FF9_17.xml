            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Israelites&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>The religion which we profess&#44; acknowledges the same truth that reason pro&#45;<lb/>claims&#59; I mean&#44; the existence of a life eternal&#44; where the highest of human<lb/> sentiments&#44; the noble thoughts and aspirations held and cherished&#44; while<lb/> we were clothed in flesh&#44; will abide with us everlastingly in a state<lb/> of pure spirituality.  That truth&#44; which underlies the pages of the<lb/> Bible&#44; and which the oldest preacher&#45;&#45;Ecclesiastes&#45;&#45;obviously declares&#44; when it says&#58; &#34;The<lb/> spirit shall return unto God that gave it&#44;&#34; is manifestly an unspeak&#45;<lb/>&#45;able source of consolation to mourners&#59; to those whom a Divine ordination<lb/> would decreed that they should consign the receptacle of noble sublime faculties&#45;&#45;the body&#45;&#45;to the grave<lb/> in which it will molder and gradually dissolve into its primitive elements.<lb/>  That comforting truth must in the present instance also allay the grief<lb/> which parents and loving p relatives feel because of a separation&#44; so<lb/> unexpected&#44; so sudden and untimely.  For had our young lamented brother left<lb/> this earth when riper in years&#44; or after a disease of a longer duration&#44; the<lb/> minds of his friends&#44; might have been somewhat prepared for his departure.<lb/>  To see him cut off in the very spring spring of manhood&#44; with the prospective<lb/> hopes of half a century of usefulness dashed against the stones of the<lb/> cold grave&#44; must of necessity cause intensity of sorrow&#44; and were it not<lb/> indeed for the assurance of a blessed immortality&#44; those who have suffered this<lb/> loss might continue for ever disconsolate.  But the religion which<lb/> agrees fully accords with reason in announcing a life better and ethereal&#44; loftier than that<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>which we now lead and which is perishable&#44; is not a gloomy religion.  It does<lb/> not teach&#44; as some erroneously imagine&#44; that to gain the heights<lb/> of immortality we must rise up upon mountains of troubles&#44; that<lb/> unless we suffer much here&#44; we cannot attain a blissful hereafter.  No&#44;<lb/> this terrestrial existence is a most precious gift from the Creator&#44;<lb/> and its rational enjoyment can but sink agree with the intentions of the<lb/> beneficent Bestower&#44; and because it surely does agree&#44; therefore He who<lb/> granted it&#44; sent with it two of His messengers to guide it aright.<lb/>  They are&#59; nature and revelation.  Nature tells us always in silent<lb/> eloquence that we dare not run counter to the rules which the<lb/> Almighty has made for the regulation preservation of our body&#59; revelation<lb/> cautions those&#44; who consult it in Holy Writ&#44; against abuses of<lb/> every character&#59; abuses apt to shorten our days&#44; or expose us to<lb/> sufferings and shame.  I have no desire to do not purpose casting reflect&#45;<lb/>&#45;ions&#44; on the contrary my f heart and a sense of duty urge me to<lb/> join in lamentations with the bereaved&#44; and to pray that they will may accept<lb/> this visitation with pious fortitude&#44; remember the promises<lb/> of reason and of faith&#44; and the bright qualities of the deceased&#44;<lb/> which will have earned for him bliss beatitude.  But seeing many<lb/> youths surround this coffin&#44; I am prompted by a longing<lb/> to do good&#44; to speak a friendly word.  The author<lb/> of the book of Proverbs&#44; wisely wrote that man&#39;s folly makes<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>his own way crooked&#44; and yet he will be angry with the<lb/> Lord&#44; because it is not straight.  We all are in duty bound<lb/> to study our health&#44; by abstaining from whatever is calculated<lb/> to injure it&#44; and by attending to whatever is conducive<lb/> to its preservation.  Often what we call enjoyment&#44; is<lb/> a slow disguised poison that enters our vitals and eats into them.  Often that in which we indulge with apparent impurity<lb/> once&#44; twice&#44; ten or even a hundred times&#44; is invisibly under&#45;<lb/>&#45;mining our physical powers&#44; and leaving us open to attacks<lb/> of sickness which cannot be overcome.  I shall not illus&#45;<lb/>&#45;trate my saying with instances that support it&#44; but too<lb/> closely forcibly your own experience&#44; my hearers&#44; may spare me<lb/> the painful task&#44; but facing now a dear dead one brought<lb/> early to the grave wit ha body seemingly vigorous in to an<lb/> exceptional degree&#44; I may not inopportunely warn my<lb/> young coreligionists not to trust themselves though they may<lb/> be of a stature like Goliath&#44; and of a physique like Samson.<lb/>  I may fittingly warn them to live comformably to nature and revelation&#44;<lb/> to follow moderation&#44; sobriety&#44; continence&#59; to check unmanly<lb/> impulses and cleave to righteousness.  Thus&#44; with the<lb/> help of the heavenly Director&#44; they will live long and pros&#45;<lb/>&#45;perously&#44; thus&#44; with the help of the Celestial Physician&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>they will overcome withstand diseases and exist during the allotted<lb/> term to enjoy the love of parents&#44; the affection of relatives<lb/> and the respect of friends.  Oh&#33; may the words of my lips&#44;<lb/> and the inspirations of my soul be acceptable and acted upon.<lb/>  And Thou Compassionate God&#33;  Deign to let Thy counten&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance shine upon a mother bent with grief by the loss of<lb/> her oldest son&#44; towards whom she looked with glowing hopes.<lb/>  Restore calmness to her mind&#59; bless her husband&#44; who deeply<lb/> mourns&#44; with the capacity to make her days pleasurable&#44;<lb/> and brimful of the sweets of home.
