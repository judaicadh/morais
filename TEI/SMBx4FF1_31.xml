            <p>Rev S. Morais<lb/>
                My dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>Though I am a little <hi rend="underline">post festum</hi> I hope<lb/> you will accept my most heartfelt felicitations upon the thirty&#45;fifth<lb/> anniversary of your ministry in the United States.  You occupy a &#91;&#63;&#93; posi&#45;<lb/>tion in the ministry.  There is not a man in our midst who does not feel that<lb/> even your opposition is an honor to the cause&#44; for you are moved by the<lb/> earnestness of conviction&#44; whereas others are moved solely by ambition<lb/> or more ignoble motives.  It must be satisfactory to you that even your<lb/> most <sic>imbittered</sic> opponents admire and respect your constancy.  Whilst<lb/> I&#44; personally&#44; have drifted away from your standpoint&#44; and right now<lb/> am as nearly allying myself to the radical party as I have ever been&#45;&#45;<lb/> thanks to the intolerance of a so&#45;called conservative press&#45;&#45;I feel towards<lb/> you as I have done since the happy day I learned to know you.  Believe<lb/> me&#44; that whatever zeal or earnestness I may have is largely stimulated<lb/> by the fine example you have set me and others&#44; and it often seems<lb/> to me that in the eternal fitness of things you are in your right place&#44;<lb/> as a rock of conservatism&#44; to deter young hotspurs from venturing<lb/> too far upon the slippery patch of inquiry.  You know that I<lb/> have ever been honest with you&#44; and that I have made you<lb/> the confidant of my mental struggles.  My &#34;intelligent conservatism&#34;<lb/> has&#44; by the sternness of events proven naught but a fond day&#45;<lb/>dream&#44; and the tables seem to be turned to the effect that<lb/></p>

            <p>whilst formerly the reformers were irreconcilable&#44; the aggressive&#45;<lb/>ness of the Mendez coterie makes it appear as if all who had<lb/> drifted away from the Shulchan Aruch had only to choose bet&#45;<lb/>ween &#91;Hebrew&#93; and &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  That you do not believe that I am fully convinced&#44;<lb/> but ignorant journalism&#45;&#45;why is Chumaceiro&#91;&#63;&#93; permitted to steer<lb/> the J. R. when he has false notions of every thing under the sun&#63;&#45;&#45;<lb/> has made it appear thus&#44; and to confess the whole truth I do not<lb/> like the alliance between yourself&#44; a pure Italian conservative&#44;<lb/> and Kohut who poses as an orthodox in this country where as in<lb/> Germany the orthodox anathematized him and the Hassidistic<lb/> Polish classes&#44; who seem to be the backbone of the Mendez agi&#45;<lb/>tation.  You will forgive me&#44; I know&#44; for speaking frankly and I<lb/> can assure you &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  You yourself I have naught<lb/> but the kindest of feeling; I thank God that I have known you<lb/> at the commencement of my career&#44; I am proud of your friend&#45;<lb/>ship and confidence&#44; and I admire your grit in facing an<lb/> organized opposition almost single handed.  I fervently hope and<lb/> pray that for many a decade you will yet be spared to the<lb/> cause&#44; which can act benefit by your constancy and that aside<lb/> from the cares and vexations of professional life your years<lb/> may be blessed by peace&#44; health and happiness &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> I conclude with the words of the sages of Pumibeditha<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#33;  With kindest regards<lb/> very truly yours<lb/> Jacob Voorsanger<lb/></p>
