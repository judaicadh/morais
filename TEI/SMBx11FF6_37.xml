            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Israelites.  Scarcely any one will believe that I stand here as<lb/> the interpreter of the sentiments of my brother&#44; whose<lb/> decaying body is enshrined in a narrow casket&#44; but whose<lb/> undying spirit ascends higher and higher through the illimit&#45;<lb/>&#45;able sphere regions of all eternity.  I recall his presence to my gentle looks<lb/> memory&#44; and think that I hear him he pleadingly urges me to speak.<lb/>  What are the utterances which this imparadised Hebrew<lb/> now imparadised dictates&#63;  You may say&#58; Perhaps J. R. would will rejoice in heaven that<lb/> heal if his praise be rehearsed upon earth.  We mortals<lb/> delight so much greatly in hearing our virtues acknowledged&#44;<lb/> and publicly extolled&#44; that we imagine it may be so also likewise with<lb/> those who have departed hence.  They may wish that<lb/> some will rise among a circle of mourning friends&#44;<lb/> and name the qualities of the heart or the endowments of the intellectual<lb/> capacities which distinguished them.  If it Were it so&#44;<lb/> my deceased coreligionist might becomingly ask that<lb/> I will point to the amiability of temperament&#44;<lb/> which&#44; according to the assurance of all who knew<lb/> him well&#44; was his characteristic&#59; or that I will<lb/> dwell on his affectionate disposition&#44; as exhibited at<lb/> home and beyond its precincts&#59; or that I will enlarge<lb/> upon his habits of industry&#44; his devotion to social duties&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>his total absence from pride&#44; or an undue self&#45;ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;preciation.  for&#44; those goodly traits&#44; which beautify hu&#45;<lb/>man existence nature&#44; have been depicted to me as the posses&#45;<lb/>&#45;sion of our lamented brother in faith.  But not to request<lb/> a panegyric&#44; however merited&#44; does his spirit com&#45;<lb/>&#45; mune now at present now with mine.  Not the laudation of a<lb/> fallible being&#44; whose &#91;&#63;&#93; must may either fall short of<lb/> the truth&#44; or offend truth&#44; and be&#44; at all wants&#44; profit&#45;<lb/>&#45;less to the departed&#44; J. R. seeks at my hands.<lb/></p>
            <p>I might follow the bent of my own mind and and delivery an elegy&#44; if not a eulogy&#44; de&#45;<lb/>&#45;ploring his a lingering death at an age when physical vigour is<lb/> mostly in its prime&#44; and life presents bright prospects&#44; the<lb/> brighter when offered by domestic surroundings&#44; by<lb/> the pleasurable anticipations of conjugal and parent&#45;<lb/>&#45;al ties.  But to do as I feel inclined&#44; would be<lb/> to tell what all within reach of my voice know and<lb/> sympathize with.  It would be to deepen sorrow<lb/> already keen and distressing.  My message is&#44; on<lb/> the contrary&#44; one of consolation.  He that expe&#45;<lb/>&#45;rienced evidences of the tenderest love&#44; when love alone<lb/> could smooth the aching pillow&#59; he that was<lb/> watched over with ceaseless care by day and by night&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>whose every motion&#45;&#45;was studied with the<lb/> view to chase away the dread terrors of approaching<lb/> death&#44; whose last hours were made painless by the<lb/> thought that his nearest and dearest would be<lb/> anxiously be provided for&#59; &#91;&#63;&#93; I mean&#44; our brother now eternized<lb/> in the realms of spirituality&#44; has but blessings and<lb/> thanks for her who proved herself a his tutelary angel&#44;<lb/> and for all who mercifully joined in acts of unwearied<lb/> attention.  In his name I express gratitude to<lb/> the living&#44; and bestow benedictions upon those living who did<lb/> him abundant good&#44; while he breathed the breath of this terrestrial<lb/> life. existence.  In his name I bide the bereaved to look<lb/> heavenward for the reward promised to deeds of<lb/> humanity.  It will surely crown the creatures who<lb/> copy their Creator exercise then such practical virtues of &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Let mercy and truth never forsake thee&#44; bind them&#44; &#40;as a<lb/> chain&#41; around thy neck&#59; write them upon the tablets<lb/> of thy heart&#59; so shalt thou find favor and good will<lb/> in the sight of God and man&#34;; and the Sages of Israel<lb/> have taught that to be God like is to alleviate the<lb/> the sufferings inherent in our nature&#44; is to be God&#45;like.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>The one among the mourners&#44; who specially considers<lb/> herself forlorn by reason of the a very sad loss&#44; should<lb/> recognize in her widowhood the sweet pledge of her husband&#39;s<lb/> love&#44; of that bond of affection&#44; surviving the grave.  In caring for<lb/> it that pledge&#44; she will obtain comfort.  May she rise above<lb/> her anguish of spirit&#44; and by training in righteous&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness the male child confided to her trust&#44; may<lb/> she find an exhaustless ever refreshing source of satisfaction.  May<lb/> the Almighty&#44; from whom all our powers for good<lb/> are derived&#44; vouchsafe proceed&#44; deign to endow the young mother<lb/> with bodily strength and mental capacities anguish capacities equal<lb/> to the task imposed upon her by nature and by the<lb/> sacred memories of recalling him that who has been translated summoned<lb/> to heaven.  May those who will aid her with counsel<lb/> and means share in the glory of having raised a Hebrew<lb/> fatherless Hebrew child to boy in the path of religion. and rectitude.<lb/></p> 
            <p>And Thou compassionate Lord&#44; forgive the tres trespas&#45;<lb/>&#45;ses which Thy servant J.
