            <p>An explanatory lecture<lb/> on Lech Lech&#39;a<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Dear hearers&#33;  An ancient author of renown&#44; &#40;Seadyah Gaon&#41;<lb/> remarked&#44; that the desire to attach to Holy Writ a<lb/> hidden meaning&#44; may lead to a rejection of its command&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments.  I will illustrate his saying.  The<lb/> mind which can be brought to look upon the bondage<lb/> of Israel in Egypt&#44; as a mere type of the enslaving<lb/> of our souls by the passions&#44; may be also made to<lb/> believe that the prohibition of having any leaven<lb/> in our houses during Passover&#44; is simply an admonition<lb/> against suffering our hearts to swell with pride.<lb/> And through a similar system of interpretation&#44; one may<lb/> also be induced to consider the inhibition to kindle fire on<lb/> the Sabbath&#44; as an exhortation&#44; that we may avoid&#44; on<lb/> the day of rest&#44; whatever may occasion strife in our<lb/> dwellings.  Nor would such a method be only calculated to<lb/> nullify Biblical precepts&#44; but it would likewise trans&#45;<lb/>&#45;form the account of God&#39;s miraculous dealings with his<lb/> people&#44; into a sheer myth.  So that&#44; for instance&#44; the<lb/> passage of the red&#45;sea&#44; might&#44; according to some&#44; signify<lb/> a transition from a state of servitude to that of freedom.<lb/>  The glorious manifestation at Sinai&#44; might stand&#44; as<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>according to others&#44; as a symbol of the brightening<lb/> of the human intellect.  In short&#58; Holy Writ would<lb/> be altogether enshrouded beneath a veil of bewildering <sic>mythcism</sic>.<lb/>  We must therefore&#44; dear Brethren&#33; be heedful not to<lb/> lest we fall into a practice&#44; which offers many attractions<lb/> to a speculative mind&#44; but which will lead it astray<lb/> from the path of revealed religion.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;The literal meaning of the text should principally engage our<lb/> attention&#59;&#34; is a maxim of our Biblical expositors&#44; worthy to be<lb/> remembered.  For&#44; man is so constituted&#44; that he will<lb/> frequently accept what is conveyed to him by figures<lb/> and <sic>imageries</sic>&#44; and set aside that which is presented<lb/> to his views in a plain&#44; unvarnished manner.  No<lb/> Unless the Scriptures speak in language&#44; that cannot<lb/> be otherwise rendered than allegorically&#44; we dare not<lb/> apply to it a sense differing from its primary construction.<lb/>  But let me be explicit.  I would not let you<lb/> suppose for a moment&#44; that I am an advocate<lb/> of the Sect of Caraites&#44; who discard oral interpretations.<lb/>  When I recommend a literal&#44; in preference to a figurative&#44;<lb/> meaning of the Biblical text&#44; I do not intend to say&#44;<lb/> that we can best learn the import of the Divine<lb/></p>

            <p>commandments&#44; by taking the words&#44; in which they<lb/> are expressed&#44; absolutely in their naked sense.  By no<lb/> means&#58; you are all aware&#44; that in every language&#44;<lb/> the popular understanding of many phrases&#44; is not<lb/> what they would appear to be at first blush.  So that&#44;<lb/> if I&#44; for example&#44; addressing any one in English&#44; were to<lb/> ask. &#34;How do you find yourself&#63;&#34;&#44; he would imme&#45;<lb/>&#45;diately perceive that I inquire after his health&#44; though<lb/> the expression I employed&#44; would&#44; <sic>primatively</sic>&#44; bear a<lb/> different construction.  Precisely for the same<lb/> reason&#44; I receive the interpretation of the ancients<lb/> about certain ordinances of the Law&#44; as correct beyond<lb/> doubt&#59; and when I am bid to &#34;afflict my soul&#34; on the<lb/> teath&#91;sic&#63;&#93; of Tishri&#44; I abstain from all sorts of food&#44; because<lb/> by such a diction&#44; is fasting expressed signified in Hebrew.  So<lb/> likewise&#44; I use a citron&#44; and not a pomegranate or an<lb/> orange&#44; at the service of the Tabernacle festival&#44; not&#45;<lb/>&#45;withstanding that the &#34;fruit of the tree of Hadar&#44;&#34; which<lb/> Holy Writ requires the Israelite to procure on that occasion&#44;<lb/> might be variously understood.<lb/></p>
            <p>In like manner&#44; as I would&#44; in studying a foreign language&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>be guided by the universal acceptation of a sentence&#44;<lb/> and not by its apparent meaning&#44; so do I rely upon<lb/> those whose knowledge of the sacred tongue was thorough&#44;<lb/> for an accurate teaching of its phraseology.<lb/></p>
            <p>What I deprecate in the explanation of the Scriptures&#44; is<lb/> our endeavoring to represent every part thereof under the<lb/> garb of symbols and types.  For&#44; that system of<lb/> interpretation&#44; followed by the founders of the Nazarene<lb/> creed&#44; caused the repudiation of Jewish laws and tenets.<lb/>  Whatever is said&#44; or prescribed in the old testament &#40;so<lb/> they styled our Bible&#41; foreshadowed the advent of a<lb/> divine redeemer.  The simplest narrative&#44; the plainest<lb/> command&#44; became to them a prefiguration of the new<lb/> doctrine they sought to inculcate.  They saw therefore<lb/> no reason for the performance of Mosaic ordinances&#44; be&#45;<lb/>&#45;cause what they represented&#44; had already been consum&#45;<lb/>&#45;mated&#44; by the coming of a celestial Messiah.  To offer<lb/> an illustration of the eagerness with which they seized<lb/> upon any passage which that might worked up be wrought<lb/> into a defence of their mystical dogmas&#44; I will<lb/> draw your attention to a transaction recorded in the<lb/> lesson of this Sabbath.<lb/></p>

            <p>Abram returning from the battle he had fought&#44; to<lb/> save his nephew from bondage and ruin&#44; was met<lb/> by a Canaanitish Chief&#59; or&#44; as Holy Writ habitually<lb/> calls every ruler&#44; a King.  The latter&#44; who&#44; amidst<lb/> the corruption of that idolatrous age&#44; acknowledged a Supreme<lb/> Power&#44; hospitably entertained the patriarch&#44; so signally<lb/> assigne assisted in his lot undertaking by the Divinity.<lb/>  Abram&#44; on the other hand&#44; recognizing in the indi&#45;<lb/>&#45;vidual&#44; who had generously &#91;&#63;&#93; supplied his wants<lb/> and those of his attendants army&#44; an object of respect&#44; and<lb/> anxious to compensate him for his outlay&#44; presented the<lb/> same with the tenth part of the spoil.  But this<lb/> account of mutual kindness&#44; between two distinguished per&#45;<lb/>&#45;sons&#44; forms&#44; in the theology of the Nazarenes&#44; a main<lb/> point of support to a theory as startling as it is<lb/> unjewish.  According to it&#44; Malchizedek is the<lb/> prototype of a man&#45;god.  As we are nowhere<lb/> informed about his extraction&#44; he must needs be a<lb/> spiritual being sent on earth for a special purpose&#44;<lb/> which was&#45;&#45;we are led to infer&#45;&#45;that the father<lb/> of the faithful should do him homage.<lb/></p>

            <p>His own name and that of the place over which he<lb/> reigned&#44; are also made to be symbols of his character.<lb/>  &#34;Malckizedek Melech Shol&#232;m&#44;&#34; is rendered thus&#58; &#34;the<lb/> righteous king&#59; the king of peace.&#34;  And inasmuch<lb/> as the Bible attests that he was a &#34;Coh&#232;n&#34; priest&#44;&#34;<lb/> therefore&#44; he could only be looked upon as the model of the one pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;destined to atone by his own blood for the sins of all mankind.<lb/>  You observe&#44; my Brethren&#33; how the recital of an<lb/> incident&#44; which has no further bearing on our<lb/> history&#44; than it demonstrates in bringing to light Abraham&#39;s upright<lb/> <sic>demeanour</sic>&#44; is&#44; by an allegorical interpretation&#44; rendered<lb/> the basis of a creed incomprehensible and subversive of that which<lb/> the righteous son of Terah strove to disseminate.<lb/>  Let no one interpose that the Rabbis also have<lb/> mystified somewhat the character of Malchizedik.<lb/>  verily Their aim was mainly to find a clue for the existence<lb/> of a believer in the Almighty among a heathen<lb/> world.  Unwilling to award to any man the merit<lb/> of having known the great Creator&#44; except to one from<lb/> whom Abraham could claim this descent&#44; they thought<lb/> that the king of Salem might have been the same as the founder<lb/> of the Shemitic family&#44; Shem the son of Noah.<lb/></p>

            <p>Thus paying no regard to the distance of time which<lb/> separated those two individuals.  But if the<lb/> teachers of our people&#44; forgot&#44; in their zeal&#44; to reckon<lb/> the days long past&#44; they never entertained the thought<lb/> of according to a human being divine honors.<lb/></p>
            <p>Were I&#44; however&#44; asked for my views on the passage<lb/> at issue&#44; I would say&#58; that neither the ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pellation nor the description of the personage there&#45;<lb/>&#45;in auspiciously brought forward&#44; warrants the<lb/> learned disputations it called forth.  For&#44; no one<lb/> familiar with Scriptural names&#44; ought to be<lb/> surprised at finding among idolaters&#44; &#34;Malchizedek&#44;&#34;<lb/> viz &#34;a king of righteousness&#34; any more than when he meets with &#34;Adonizedek&#44;&#34;<lb/> &#34;the lord of righteousness&#34;&#45;&#45;a heathen ruler whom Joshua<lb/> conquered&#59; or &#34;Tobiyah&#34; the pleasure of God&#34;; an<lb/> Ammonite inimical to the Jews.   Rightly have our sages said &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;We cannot ascribe a reason for the adoption of this or that name.&#34;  And as to<lb/> the title of &#34;priest to the most high God.&#34; I have strong<lb/> grounds for conceiving that it means&#44; &#34;the adorer<lb/> of a higher power&#44;&#34; than the stars and planets then<lb/> <sic>worshipped</sic> as <sic>seperate</sic> deities.  For &#34;Coh&#232;n&#34;<lb/> has been in Biblically used in that sense&#44; not less<lb/> than in that of prince&#44; of chief and of counsellor&#59;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p>and I need not say that &#34;El&#34; signifies &#34;power&#34;.<lb/>  Malchizedek&#44; like Socrates and others in later<lb/> ages&#44; discovered without immediate revelation&#44; that the heavens<lb/> and the earth are the work of an all&#45;mighty<lb/> Being&#44; and Him be revered&#44; and recognized as the<lb/> protector of Abraham.  But that notwithstanding<lb/> this fact his knowledge of the Supreme was not<lb/> equal in purity extent and purity to that possessed by the father of the<lb/> Hebrew nation&#44; is clear to my mind.  For&#44; I read<lb/> that when our patriarch swore to the King of Sodom&#44;<lb/> that he would not receive even a thread of the<lb/> property he had recovered from the enemy&#44; he spoke<lb/> as follows &#34;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#34;  I lift up my hand unto<lb/> Adona&#239;&#44; the highest Power&#44; creator of heaven and earth&#59;&#34;<lb/> prefacing the ineffable name of the Lord&#44; to the<lb/> expression made by his friend&#44; as if to intimate that<lb/> besides the Being he invoked&#44; there exists neither<lb/> intermediate nor superior gods.<lb/></p>
            <p>But even conceding that the King of Salem had<lb/> a perfect knowledge of the one everlasting Lord&#44; from whom Ab&#45;<lb/>&#45;raham drew inspiration&#44; that could not surely<lb/> exalt him to the position he has been assigned<lb/></p>

            <p>by the Nazarenes.  He might&#44; at the utmost&#44;<lb/> be entitled to an equal share of honor with the<lb/> father of the faithful&#44; who the memory of whose<lb/> piety is cherished by his descendants&#59; but who is&#44;<lb/> nevertheless&#44; considered the child of human parents&#59;<lb/> born as other men&#44; and like them turned into dust.<lb/>  What has lent support to the mystical ideas which<lb/> the Nazarene Church connected with that historical per&#45;<lb/>&#45;sonage&#44; is a misapprehension of a psalm&#44; in which<lb/> his name occurs again.  I said a misappre&#45;<lb/> &#45;hension&#44; but I might have applied to it a stronger<lb/> term&#44; and called it a &#34;misrepresentation&#34;&#44; for such<lb/> it certainly is.  Judge yourselves&#58; The Hebrew<lb/> words with which that composition begins run<lb/> thus &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Now&#44; my Brethren&#58; a person<lb/> must be ignorant of the very rudiments of the sacred<lb/> language&#44; who does not know&#44; that the word &#34;Adona&#239;&#34;<lb/> as written&#44; but not allowed to be pronounced&#44; means&#59;<lb/> &#34;the everlasting God&#34;; while &#34;Adoni&#34; is an epithet&#44; equivalent<lb/> to the English term&#44; &#34;Sir&#44;&#34; exclusively used in speaking<lb/> to a human being.  Yet the&#44; so styled&#44; authorized<lb/> version writes both words with capital letters&#44; and<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>renders the phrase just quoted in this manner.<lb/>  &#34;The Lord said unto my Lord.&#34; implying that he<lb/> who has been named second&#44; is precisely like the first&#44;<lb/> or&#44; he partakes of the same divine nature.<lb/></p>
            <p>I will not detain you&#44; my dear hearers&#33; with a<lb/> comment upon the whole of the 110th psalm&#44; proving<lb/> that&#44; according to the opinion of the most accredited<lb/> among our expositors&#44; it is an address to David by<lb/> some of his subjects&#44; in which the Almighty is<lb/> described as bidding his <sic>annointed</sic> King to rest<lb/> from his toils&#44; while He Himself&#44; would from<lb/> heaven combat his adversaries.  I will simply<lb/> request your careful perusal thereof&#44; for&#44; its<lb/> true meaning cannot be mistaken.  When<lb/> you read&#44; &#34;Out of Zion will the Lord stretch forth<lb/> the rod of thy strength&#59; or&#44; &#34;thy people willingly<lb/> come in the day of thy power&#34;&#44; you will intui&#45;<lb/>&#45;tively perceive that only to a human Potentate&#44;<lb/> and such as David was&#44; could that writing be<lb/> addressed.<lb/></p>
            <p>But as the mentioning of Malchezidek in that<lb/> psalm&#44; has been a rock upon which the<lb/></p>

            <p>believer in a messiah coexisting with God&#44; built<lb/> some of their theories&#44; I will explain its purport.<lb/>  From various sentences in Holy Writ&#44; we gather&#44; that<lb/> the Almighty vouchsafed to promise David a<lb/> durable dominion&#59; as&#44; where it is declared &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#34;thy throne shall be established always&#34;.  Hence&#44;<lb/> the author of the 110th psalm&#44; <sic>apostrophising</sic><lb/> his Sovereign said hyperbolically &#34;The Lord hath sworn<lb/> and will not repent&#59; thou art a prince for ever&#44; ac&#45;<lb/>&#45;cording to the manner of Malchizedek&#34; proposing to<lb/> signify&#44; that as that ancient Chief bore the sway&#44; became<lb/> sustained by the higher power he acknowledged&#44; so<lb/> would David&#44; a new Malchizedek&#44; or &#34;King of righteousness&#44;&#34;<lb/> be upheld by the mighty Lord he <sic>worshipped</sic>; and<lb/> as it immediately follows &#34;The Lord&#44; at thy right&#45;hand&#44;<lb/> strikes down kings in the day of his wrath.&#34;  In<lb/> this instance as in others&#44; the term &#34;Coh&#232;n&#34; must<lb/> be rendered &#34;Prince&#34; and not &#34;priest&#59;&#34; and the expres&#45;<lb/>&#45;sion &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; as I have translated it&#44;<lb/> and not as <sic>intrepreted</sic> without authority&#44; by<lb/> King Jame&#39;s authorized version.<lb/></p>
            <p>This last remark of mine&#44; is the disclosure of<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="13"/>
            <p>the object I intended to reach by the present<lb/> lecture.  Brethren&#33;  I feel assured that<lb/> you stand <sic>immoveably</sic> firm in the ancestral creed.  All the<lb/> arguments speciously drawn from the Bible&#44; could<lb/> not convince you&#44; that the everlasting Creator&#44; shares<lb/> His glory with another.  But your children&#39;s ideas<lb/> of upon religions dogmas are not yet well formed&#59; while their sur&#45;<lb/>&#45;roundings are calculated to divert their minds from<lb/> the channel.  You would desire they may be directed.<lb/>  The schools they generally most frequent&#44; the youths with<lb/> whom they associate&#59; the books they read&#44; will re&#45;<lb/>present to them Judaism&#44; as an old decayed structure&#44; upon<lb/> the ruin of which a more beautiful and lasting edifice<lb/> has been erected.  They will even be asked to seek<lb/> shelter within its broad isles&#59; and means will not be neglected<lb/> to excite the wish.  And if to this undeniable fact&#44;<lb/> be added the consideration&#44; that the authority of the<lb/> Scriptures will be invoked to show reasons for the belief<lb/> of the majority&#44; who can then predict that the sons<lb/> and daughters of Israel&#44; will cling fast to their faith&#63;<lb/>  It is imperative on us to counteract the influences at<lb/> work against Judaism.  We cannot alter society&#59;<lb/></p>

            <p>nor&#44; wisely&#44; recommend exclusiveness and<lb/> seclusion.  We must live among and associate<lb/> with our gentile neighbors.  We must cultivate<lb/> their good&#45;will&#44; and act towards them kindly<lb/> and considerately.  But we must withal furnish<lb/> our offspring as with an armour of steel&#44; upon which<lb/> all the arguments advanced by the adherents of the man<lb/> of Nazareth&#44; will make no impression.<lb/></p>
            <p>That armour&#44; my dear friends hearers&#33; is a correct knowledge<lb/> of their Bible.  They will not&#44; likely&#44; acquire it<lb/> from the original&#59; for&#44; in this age the Hebrew lan&#45;<lb/>guage is cast aside as a useless study.  We must<lb/> then endeavour to place in their hands&#44; a translation<lb/> free from bias.  Without denying to that habitually<lb/> read&#44; the merits of a terse style&#44; and general accuracy&#44;<lb/> I must declare it dangerous&#44; because of its leaning<lb/> to sectional interests.  Apart from the version itself&#44;<lb/> which lends its weight to peculiar tenets&#44; the headings<lb/> of various chapters tend to forestall one&#39;s judgment<lb/> in favor of doctrines&#44; which we must for ever reject.<lb/>  That for instance&#44; the psalm to which I have referred&#44;<lb/> in the course of my lecture&#44; has for its caption&#44;<lb/></p>

It should be superseded by some other.<lb/>  But it this must be obtained cheaply.  To popularize<lb/> the Bible&#44; its cost must be but nominal.  The<lb/> poorest among our brethren should possess a copy&#44; which<lb/> his family may safely peruse.  Is there no public<lb/> spirit in the Hebrews of America&#63;  Churches of<lb/> other denominations&#44; expend millions to disseminate<lb/> the principles of their faith.  We bestow fabulous<lb/> amounts to rear temples to vanity&#44; but cannot find<lb/> a coin in our rich purses to devote to the perpe&#45;<lb/>&#45;tuation of our precious heirloom&#58; the heavenly volumes.<lb/>  Oh&#33; let us give liberal and personal aid to a publica&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion society.  It is high time that the Jews should<lb/> be distinguished for their intellectual progress&#44; as they<lb/> are known for their worldly <sic>acquisions</sic>.<lb/></p>
            <p>This country wherein we safely dwell in peace is that fittest for the in which we<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93; can most successfully labor for our mental improve&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment.  Let us go earnestly to work&#44; and the<lb/> blessing of God will attend our endeavours.<lb/></p>
