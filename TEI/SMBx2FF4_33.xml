            <p>Washington D. C. &#91;Hebrew&#93; May 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1877<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. S. Morais<lb/>
            Revd Dear Sir&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>Just now I find a quiet half an hour to write you a<lb/> letter to my heart&#39;s content.  I must ask you in advance to<lb/> prepare yourself with a goodly amount of patience as<lb/> I am determined to tell you almost everything I know<lb/> in the way of personal and general news.  Let me com&#44;<lb/>mence with myself.<lb/></p>
            <p>As much as I prefer to address you in Hebr. yet I fear<lb/> I do not possess the fluency of writing on so many<lb/> various subjects&#44; and therefore address you this time<lb/> in English.  Perhaps this is a curious confession in a<lb/> Hebrew minister but as you have already seen specimens<lb/> of my writing&#44; I think you will judge me charitably<lb/> and confess that compared with others of equal<lb/> age &#38; better standing I can stand my ground.  Besides<lb/> to use your own words „it is only by dint of constant<lb/> practice we can prosper.„  And I to my shame confess<lb/> I have not practiced and consequently lost many<lb/> of my earlier ability of writing the Hebr.  It will<lb/> please you to learn I am progressing <sic>finaly</sic>.  My congre„<lb/>gation apparently like&#44; I would say love&#44; me and<lb/> they deeply appreciate any of my efforts in their be&#44;<lb/>half.  Our late Fair&#44; gotten up through my efforts&#44; netted<lb/> them 1000 dollars and they recognized my efforts<lb/> in a handsome set of parlor furniture &#38; carpet Fi<lb/>nancially I am little better off than in Philadelphia&#44; ex&#44;<lb/>cepting that I live comfortably &#38; without trouble.  My<lb/> school is prospering&#44; the children are learning well&#44;<lb/> as please God I will be able to prove at the exa&#44;<lb/>mination&#44; Sunday after &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  I will send you<lb/> an account thereof at the proper time.  My ser&#44;<lb/>mons are &#40;according to my critic&#39;s Mr. Wolf&#39;s opinion&#41;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p><sic>are</sic> gradually improving.  After reading my last printed effort&#44;<lb/> which I regret you did not peruse carefully&#44; he emphatically<lb/> assured me that I need not be afraid of making my way<lb/> in this country.  That this was no flattery I am convinced&#44;<lb/> since at the same time he pointed out to me several mis&#44;<lb/>takes in style &#38; language.  I need not tell you I study<lb/> day &#38; night&#44; and the more I study the more I like it<lb/> I know this will please you&#44; as there is not a shadow<lb/> of doubt in my mind that you take a lively interest<lb/> in my welfare.  All I pray for is&#44; that I will continue<lb/> to deserve it.  Here I must state to you&#44; which I have<lb/> already done quite imperfectly in a former letter&#44;<lb/> that my religious convictions have underwent con&#44;<lb/>siderable since I left you.  I have carefully weighed<lb/> and studied the subject&#44; read various works pro &#38;<lb/> con and I now have arrived at the conclusion&#44;<lb/> which henceforth will be in me firm and unshaking&#44;<lb/> that the safeguard of all religions consists <del>and</del><lb/> in a strict conservative course.  Bringing this<lb/> into practice with our own dear religion I firmly<lb/> hold&#44; that while I nevermore can be an ardent<lb/> advocate of ultra&#45;orthodoxy&#44; Judaism can never<lb/> thrive under the present radical system&#44; which<lb/> professes to leave the ancient doctrines untouched<lb/> and simply aims at changes in ceremonial worship<lb/> It is not so.  There is a serpent pawing at the<lb/> heart of our religion everywhere&#44; a serpent called<lb/> indifference&#44; <del>in</del> a disease superinduced by too<lb/> radical teachings&#44; Catholicism retains its hold<lb/> by its orthodoxy&#44; Methodism ide&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; and if Judaism<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>has &#91;Hebrew&#93; lost its hold in its worshiper&#39;s it is because<lb/> its conservative tendencies have been tampered with.<lb/>  And yet&#44; singular phenomenon&#44; orthodox Judaism<lb/> is vastly disappearing from the face of the earth.<lb/>  Even in my own congregation&#44; to whom I constantly&#44;<lb/> like Cato with his <hi rend="underline">carthago delenda esse</hi>&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; preach<lb/> that conservatism is our only stronghold&#44; there<lb/> is a little commotion&#44; which ultimate theaters<lb/> to become a great uproar.  I will picture to you<lb/> the state of affairs&#44; but of course in the strictest<lb/> confidence.  There are three parties in our little commu&#44;<lb/>nity.  The first &#38; strongest party is composed of a set<lb/> of as intelligent gentlemen as there is to be found<lb/> in this country.  They are not at all orthodox but are<lb/> rather tolerant in order not to encroach upon the<lb/> religious convictions of the other two parties.  Still<lb/> they among themselves regret the hyperorthodoxy&#44; which<lb/> compels them to recite long &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; without they un&#44;<lb/>derstand them &#38; which unnecessarily prolong the<lb/> already too lengthy services&#44; and while they would<lb/> not advocate an organ&#44; they would love to see some<lb/> abbreviation in the prayerbook.  This party as stated<lb/> before&#44; keeps itself aloof of any controversy&#44; simply<lb/> contenting themselves with paying their dues.  The<lb/> general government of school &#38; congr. however is in<lb/> their hands&#44; and they always act like gentlemen just<lb/> &#38; fair.  The second party&#44; who have no leader&#44; <del>but</del><lb/> consists of a set of ignorant Polanders&#44; who<lb/> see in every trifling departure from <del>lan</del> centenarian<lb/> landmarks a transgression against the Lord.  They<lb/> are however easily to be ruled and willingly listen<lb/></p>

            <p>to my advice.  They profess to like me and I believe they do.<lb/>  I forgot to mention that the neutral party are my sup&#44;<lb/>porters one &#38; all.  The thin party is dangerous.  They con&#44;<lb/>sist of a few ignorant Bavarians&#44; with empty heads&#44;<lb/> <sic>illitirate</sic>&#44; without culture &#38; a good deal of brass.<lb/>  They&#44; so to say&#44; pull God Almighty by his ears from<lb/> Heaven.  I never in my life saw more superstitious<lb/> and bigoted race&#44; and although I am on good terms<lb/> with all except their leader&#44; who voted against<lb/> my election&#44; because he saw me take a drink at<lb/> a friend&#39;s house bareheaded&#44; yet I do not like them<lb/> for I am disgusted with their bigotry&#44; and any<lb/> attempt of mine to convince them would tend<lb/> towards vigorous opposition.  Now&#44; strange to say&#44;<lb/> there is constant war between the second &#38; third<lb/> parties&#44; war to the knife &#38; why&#63;  Because both of them<lb/> are a set of ignorant men.  A Polander for instance<lb/> contends that &#91;Hebrew&#93; must be said after &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> a Bavarian contends the reverse&#44; and there<lb/> is war.  <del>Constant</del> Bitter feeling &#38; animosity has this<lb/> present moment become so frequent&#44; that there<lb/> is fear of a rupture&#44; which I may yet be able<lb/> to avert&#44; owing to my influence with the neutral<lb/> &#38; Polish party.  Between us&#44; I think it would<lb/> be a blessing for the congregation if these foul<lb/> Bavarians would leave.  The <sic>polish</sic> people are<lb/> tractable&#44; they aren ot &#38; never will be.  Their<lb/> leader&#44; a Mr. Oppenheimer&#44; a man of sixty&#44; who<lb/> has had as much Jewish or other education<lb/> as my baby&#45;boy&#44; has already at my arrival<lb/> denounced me as a reformer&#44; without the least pro&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>vocation.  This &#91;Hebrew&#93; is a firebrand&#44; a man who has no<lb/> peace and constantly troubles the congregation.  He is on<lb/> intimate terms with the sexton&#44; a Russian&#44; a Mephisto in<lb/> disguise.  This fellow&#44; who was jealous of my election has<lb/> been dogging my footsteps&#44; and instead of keeping on<lb/> friendly terms with me has also denounced me for not<lb/> being hyper orthodox.  Thank God&#44; the congregation have<lb/> always sustained me against this scoundrel&#44; who is<lb/> just at present under charges for incapacity &#38; slandering<lb/> the members.  It is actually deplorable to behold these two<lb/> orthodox wings consuming each other and battling for what<lb/> they call &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; but which is actually &#91;Hebrew&#93; for<lb/> their first threat is always to break up the congre&#44;<lb/>gation.  As I said before I may be able to avert the danger&#44;<lb/> but if they are bound to leave so much the better&#44; for<lb/> then the congregation will be ridden of turbulent<lb/> spirits and many others will join&#44; who refrain at<lb/> present&#44; owing to their dislike of these fellows.  I have<lb/> to do actual pioneer work in order to bring the con&#44;<lb/>gregation in proper standing&#44; but with the help of<lb/> my God&#44; I shall not shrink of doing my whole duty.<lb/>  My position is secured&#44; unless their numbers would<lb/> considerably diminish&#44; but this I fear not&#44; for neither<lb/> party is strong enough to have a congregation of their<lb/> own&#44; and they are too pious &#91;&#63;&#93; to remain without<lb/> a <hi rend="underline">shool</hi>.  The attendance on Friday evening and<lb/> Sabbath is all I could wish for.  We have regularly<lb/> from fifty to sixty worshipers&#44; which numbers is<lb/> still greater on Holy days.  The decorum ought to be<lb/> better.  I cannot conceal to myself that the<lb/> fact of my lectures being more substantial<lb/></p>

            <p>Enclosed you find a letter from an old friend&#44; Heham&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> Charbon.  The old gentleman is already two weeks<lb/> in W. but has met with decided ill&#45;luck&#44; the<lb/> people at large having no sympathy with his cause.<lb/>  He is my guest&#44; and has insisted upon sending<lb/> you a letter.  He makes no friends here&#44; for he has the<lb/> same fault that unfortunately so many have&#44; his<lb/> tongue is just a bit too long.  He upbraids the people<lb/> for not giving him enough&#44; and this of course&#44; pre&#44;<lb/>possesses them against him.  If you will be kind<lb/> enough to answer&#44; within 48 hours he will receive<lb/> your response.  Between us&#44; I will be glad if he<lb/> is once safely ensconced in a Pullman car.<lb/>  Apropos of <sic>travellers</sic>&#44; last week I was cheated<lb/> nicely.  Mr. Lazarus&#44; a kind of teacher whom you<lb/> must know&#44; paid me a friendly &#91;&#63;&#93; visit.  He<lb/> told me a pitiful story&#44; to which I paid no<lb/> attention.  All he demanded was his fare to<lb/> Philadelphia.  The chacham being my guest&#44; I<lb/> told him I could not retain him in my house&#44;<lb/> but gave him money&#44; insisting upon it he should<lb/> go to a Kosher Boarding house of which I<lb/> gave him the address.  From Thursday to Sunday<lb/></p>

            <p>I think&#44; dear sir&#44; I have taxed your patience long<lb/> enough already.  I could write much more filling<lb/> lots of pages&#44; but I reserve to myself the pleasure.<lb/>  In the mean time I shall be honored with<lb/> your response&#44; if you deem one necessary.<lb/>  I send you the respectful <del>respectess</del> regards of my<lb/> family &#38; add my profound wishes for your<lb/> health &#38; well being.
