            <p>Rev. Dr. S. Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Sir&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>I was very glad to have you visit<lb/> me this week &#38; wish to thank you sin<lb/>cerely for the kindly interest you have<lb/> manifested in my unfortunate behalf.<lb/>  During the last few years when fate<lb/> seems to have been against me&#44; when<lb/> nothing but hardships and ill luck<lb/> have continuously fallen to my lot&#44; I<lb/> had almost come to the conclusion<lb/> that in this wide world of ours there<lb/> was but little hope for me to rise<lb/> again to that level of social life&#44;<lb/> which I once occupied.  When I say<lb/> this&#44; I mean to convey the idea&#44; that<lb/> considering the difficulties&#44; both<lb/> material &#38; social&#44; which rise up be&#45;<lb/>fore my mental vision&#44; seemed to<lb/> me so great &#38; surrounded by such<lb/> peculiar circumstances&#44; that it would<lb/></p>

            <p>be an almost impossible task to over&#45;<lb/>come them all.  It is not necessary<lb/> to moralize or philosophize&#44; or for me<lb/> to tell you dear Dr that this is a<lb/> cold&#44; apathetic&#44; nay even relentless<lb/> world where selfishness is the<lb/> general rule and true humanitarian<lb/> love or real sympathy &#40;not merely light<lb/>&#45;ly expressed from human lips and<lb/> which consists too often in words<lb/> lightly spoken devoid of true sin&#45;<lb/>&#45;cerity&#41; are only exceptional.<lb/>  I am glad to be able to say that<lb/> during all my trials &#38; adversity<lb/> I have not become a convert to<lb/> the philosophical teachings of a<lb/> &#34;Schopenhauer&#34; that is an absol&#45;<lb/>ute &#34;Pessimist&#34; in all my views<lb/> of life and its concomitant<lb/> surroundings&#44; for I cannot bring<lb/> myself to the point of denial<lb/> that there is not some real<lb/> goodness&#44; or that there are not<lb/> at least a few real true human<lb/></p>

            <p>the most lowly of human begins&#44; es&#45;<lb/>pecially one of their own race&#44; should<lb/> be worthy of their thoughts &#38; attent&#45;<lb/>ion.  To a certain extent <sic>therefor</sic><lb/> in that respect dear Dr I&#39;ll con&#45;<lb/>fess that I am a sceptic in as far<lb/> as the sincerity &#38; motives of the afor&#45;<lb/>mentioned gentlemen is concerned&#44;<lb/> for in my own mind I am satis&#45;<lb/>fied that they <hi rend="underline">do not practice</hi> what<lb/> they preach &#38; as far as I am con&#45;<lb/>cerned individually&#44; I hold the<lb/> belief that although some of the<lb/> good deeds of certain people may<lb/> be heralded to the public in<lb/> papers or contribution lists&#44; yet<lb/> if the motives &#38; spirits of their<lb/> hearts could be tested which<lb/> induces them to do these acts&#44; then in<lb/> a good many instances the truth&#45;<lb/>ful answer would be not one<lb/> &#34;true Philanthropy or brotherly<lb/> love&#44;&#34; but nothing but love of<lb/> notoriety &#38; the desire to appear<lb/></p>

            <p>benefactors of the human race &#38; let<lb/> every one know it.  But enough of<lb/> that now Dr.  You kindly offered<lb/> to render me whatever little assist<lb/>ance you could as I told you<lb/> that my time here expires on Nov.<lb/> 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> next &#38; that with God&#39;s help<lb/> I will be liberated again on that<lb/> day.  Now I think I explained to<lb/> you dear Dr. that none of my relatives<lb/> know my present whereabouts &#38; that<lb/> I do not want them to know either.<lb/>  There are plenty of Jehudim in this<lb/> city some of the most prominent<lb/> merchants in town who all co me<lb/> from my native province&#44; some of<lb/> them from the immediate vicinity<lb/> of my native town &#38; I am sure<lb/> all of these know or heard of<lb/> my father &#38; relations.  However<lb/> <hi rend="underline">I know that it would not be<lb/> a good or safe policy for me</hi><lb/> to communicate with these people<lb/> &#38; let them know where I am<lb/></p>

            <p>because eventually my sad lot &#38;<lb/> disgrace would not be kept a<lb/> <hi rend="underline">sacred secret</hi> &#38; thus leak out &#38;<lb/> become known at my distant home<lb/> causing not alone a disgrace to<lb/> myself <del>alone</del> but to all my<lb/> dear ones &#38; their children.  I<lb/> wrote home to my dear old father<lb/> about 16 months ago&#44; but failed<lb/> to receive a reply from him.<lb/>  Still I was happy to learn through<lb/> an indirect source that he was<lb/> alive at that time &#38; I hope &#38;<lb/> pray to the Almighty that he may<lb/> be alive today and that I<lb/> may be enabled to go to him<lb/> &#38; see &#38; embrace him once more<lb/> as soon as possible after my<lb/> release.  Now then all I would<lb/> like you to do for me dear Dr.<lb/> is&#44; to get some one of your friends<lb/> in whose discretion you have<lb/> absolute confidence to write a<lb/> letter &#40;in the <sic>german</sic> language&#41; to<lb/></p>
