            <p>Funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>My friends&#33;  If I&#44; at this sad hour&#44; followed the prom&#45;<lb/>&#45;ptings of my heart&#44; I would only add to the lament<lb/> which resounds round this coffin&#59; for the image of<lb/> the once blooming creature now enshrined therein&#44; stands<lb/> before my vision.  I cannot evoke but thoughts of<lb/> blighted hopes and blasted anticipations.  True&#44; they<lb/> who well understood human nature said&#44; that no<lb/> mortal ever departed hence&#44; who had compassed half<lb/> of his desires &#91;Hebrew&#93;; but to die in the spring<lb/> of life&#44; while the breast is glowing with virginal love&#59;<lb/> to bid the earth an everlasting farewell when it assumed<lb/> a brighter aspect&#44; ans promised durable joys&#44; is that<lb/> which must forcibly draw tears from the eyes of the<lb/> most apathetic.  Alas&#63;  my friends&#33; that such was the<lb/> fate of our lamented sister.  In those practical days of<lb/> our existence&#44; when the heart opens to delightful emotions&#44;<lb/> she had plighted her hand to a man of her choice.<lb/>  She was perhaps contemplating an early consummation<lb/> of her ardent wish&#44; when seized with a distemper&#44; unfor&#45;<lb/>tunately too long neglected in its incipient state.<lb/>  Consuming daily in the fire hidden within her&#44; she<lb/> never desponded.  The buoyancy of her youth&#44; lent<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>extraordinary vigour to her decaying frame.  On the verge<lb/> of dissolution she spoke but of prospective happiness.<lb/>  What eye&#44; my friends&#33; save that of the Omniscient God&#44;<lb/> saw the racking of her soul&#44; when the awful truth<lb/> was disclosed to her&#59; when she learnt that the light of<lb/> her existence was very nigh extinguished&#33;  Yet she<lb/> murmured not&#44; and the assurance of the ever&#45;watchful<lb/> mother that she had been a dutiful child&#44; soothed the<lb/> dying daughter&#44; and reconciled her to her melancholy<lb/> fate.  Oh no&#44; I feel totally disqualified to offer<lb/> words of consolation under circumstances so harrowing.<lb/></p>
            <p>But if my deep sympathy for their loss&#44; denies me<lb/> the satisfaction of comforting the mourners&#44; I am nevertheless<lb/> enjoyined by the office I hold&#44; to point out the lessons which<lb/> this sad event teaches.  My friends&#33;  The effect<lb/> of death must be to bring us the living nearer to God.  When the<lb/> heart bleeds we must apply to the merciful Physi&#45;<lb/>&#45;cian&#44; that he may restore us to health.  Bereft of<lb/> the darling object&#44; on whom we lavished our affection&#44; we<lb/> must cast ourselves into the arms that sustain the<lb/> universe.  They will raise us aloft.  We shall not<lb/> sink in despair&#59; for &#34;the name of the Lord is a tower<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>of strength&#59; let the righteous only fly to it<lb/> and they shall be saved&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> We will then learn that the Father of all&#44; afflicts but<lb/> to instruct&#59; that He designs to purify us from the<lb/> dross of the world and render us more spiritual.<lb/>  In this light did the royal Psalmist regard his innu&#45;<lb/>&#45;merable sorrows&#44; and therefore he exclaimed &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;It is good that I was afflicted&#44; that I might<lb/> learn thy statutes&#34;  If you will&#44; my friends&#44; so under&#45;<lb/>stand and accept this trial&#44; it will prove your healing<lb/> balm&#59; the means of obtaining divine protection here below&#59;<lb/> eternal beatitude above.<lb/></p>
            <p>But another lesson which you must derive from this deplorable<lb/> incident&#44; is&#44; that death levels down all inequalities.<lb/>  Alike the powerless and the great are commingled in<lb/> the dust of the grave&#44; and there shall we also find the<lb/> slave free from his master &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/> This idea should remind us of our common brotherhood.<lb/>  How ill does haughtiness become the same frail and<lb/> perishable beings.  Pride&#44; hatred&#44; rancour&#44; ill&#45;feelings&#44;<lb/> all those low passions that separate brother from<lb/> brother&#44; must appear th but the creatures of demons.<lb/>  When ushered together before the tribunal of Him<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>whose eyes are too pure to behold evil.<lb/>  Then will we be ashamed of our follies&#44; then<lb/> would we fain be enabled to atone for our past<lb/> trespasses.  My friends&#33;  If any among you<lb/> has harbored such baneful sentiments&#44; let him banish<lb/> them away ere he stand on the brink of another<lb/> existence.  Let the thought of death&#44; now vividly<lb/> represented before his mind&#44; draw him nearer to his<lb/> fellow&#45;mortals.  Aye&#44; over the remains of this<lb/> spotless creature&#44; whose spirit has been wafted to the<lb/> regions of bliss&#44; vow you each other a lasting reconciliation.<lb/>  Swear also to be faithful to God&#44; kind to all his creatures&#44;<lb/> meek and forbearing in your dispositions&#44; and the severe<lb/> trial you have sustained&#44; will be the bitter portion that<lb/> will restore all to spiritual health and happiness.<lb/>  So may it be.  Amen.<lb/></p>
