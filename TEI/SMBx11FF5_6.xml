            <p>For the 1st Sabbath of the 3 weeks&#44; it being also the 4th of July<lb/></p>
            
            <p>When all mankind shall celebrate a day&#44; like this American<lb/> anniversary&#44; Israel will cease to weep.  When the air of freedom&#44;<lb/> which blew refreshingly on this new world&#44; shall purify every&#45;<lb/>&#45;where the atmosphere tainted by the breath of autocracy absolutism and<lb/> priest&#45;craft&#44; the three weeks of mourning for the loss<lb/> of the Jewish polity and for its accompanying sorrows subsequent horrors&#44;<lb/> will change into a period of festivity.  Religious pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;scription will then be unmeaning words&#44; and the ideal<lb/> people&#44; that people who hailed martyrdom as the<lb/> sanctification of principles&#44; will be set nationally high.<lb/>  Such is the soul&#45;sustaining belief of the worshippers<lb/> of Thy Unity&#44; O God&#33;  Therefore grateful emotions now<lb/> pervades our beings.  For&#44; on this self&#45;same day<lb/> were cast the germs of a future&#44; pregnant with hap&#45;<lb/>&#45;piness to the afflicted.  Thou&#44; O Lord&#33; didst pity<lb/> those that hungered after liberty independence&#44; and sentest forth<lb/> the great Sower of righteousness.  He invited<lb/> all in Thy name to cull of the fruits of his planting&#59; as<lb/> in later times the strong&#45;sinewed worker in the <sic>feild</sic> of<lb/> humanity&#44; was commissioned inspired by Thee to hedge it in&#44; against<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>the incursions of <sic>savegeness</sic>.  Washington and Lincoln<lb/> predestined to level the way for the approach of sal&#45;<lb/>&#45;vation&#44; we recognize as the ministers of Thy loving&#45;<lb/>kindness to the a remnant of Judah.  Illustrious was<lb/> their existence&#44; and the influence of their immortal deeds<lb/> will reache the uttermost parts ends of the earth.<lb/></p>
            <p>The shouting for joy&#44; which breaks forth spontaneously<lb/> upon this day of remembrance Thou hast made.  O Lord&#33;<lb/> will finally be the death&#45;knell of oppression.<lb/>  Then Zion will join her younger sisters in the march<lb/> of freedom liberty&#44; and she shall be given prominence under<lb/> the leadership of a scion of the Davidian stock.<lb/>  Speed that even O Compassionate Father&#33;  For&#44; what<lb/> to our short&#45;sighted understanding&#44; seems beyond the<lb/> range of possibilities&#44; Thou canst swiftly draw nigh<lb/> to our vision.  Less than a century has sufficed<lb/> Thee to form a royal nation&#44; to strengthen&#44; enlarge beautify and<lb/> enrich her boundaries to a degree baffling all human<lb/> calculations.  Yet&#44; eighteen centuries of wrongs unredressed&#44;<lb/> and of persecution bitter and relentless&#44; Thou hast suf&#45;<lb/>&#45;fered&#44; O God&#33; to pass over the heads of Thy faithful&#33;<lb/>  Even this month&#44; which to us&#44;&#45;&#45;the coheirs of a matchless<lb/></p>

            <p>legacy&#45;&#45;&#44; is the reminder of past and present glories&#44; awaking<lb/> in many of our brethren the sad reminiscence of the origin<lb/> of their unabated calamities sorrows.  For in it the Roman eagle<lb/> whose talons were thrust in our sides&#44; carried the exiles far<lb/> beyond away from their ancestral borders&#44; and delivered them a prey to monsters&#44;<lb/> that tore their flesh&#44; and drank their life&#45;blood.<lb/></p>
            <p>Almighty God&#33;  Thou who hast made America the ensign<lb/> to which all tearful eyes look with hope&#44; let the device<lb/> inscribed upon its folds&#44; become the guide of the human race.<lb/>  We long for a universal festivity like that which is parti&#45;<lb/>&#45;cipated in by the millions of the natives of this land&#44; and<lb/> of the strangers.  We pray that others may enjoy that<lb/> security which fears no tyrannic molestation&#44; that progress<lb/> which is unchecked by foreign dictation&#44; that thriving<lb/> prosperity which is the effect of honored handicraft.<lb/>  Grant that country the favored republic whose birth&#45;day is now jubilantly observed&#44;<lb/> be the harbinger of the world&#39;s deliverance&#59; and as she<lb/> has proved a shield to the oppressed&#44; so may she be<lb/> the fosterer of Judah&#39;s greatness.  Then will be verified<lb/> Thy declaration of to Jeremiah rehearsed this Sabbath &#34;Thus saith the Lord&#44; I remember<lb/> unto thee the kindness of thy youth&#44; the love of thy espousals&#44;<lb/> thy going after me in the wilderness&#44; through a land<lb/></p>

            <p>that was not sown.  Israel is holiness unto the Lord&#44;<lb/> the first fruits of his increase&#44; all that devour him<lb/> shall offend&#44; evil shall come upon them&#44; saith the Lord.&#34;<lb/></p>
