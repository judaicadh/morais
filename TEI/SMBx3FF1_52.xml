            <p>REVEREND AND DEAR SIR&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>You have doubtless seen in the public prints the appeal for aid<lb/> made by the Executive Committee charged with the duty of founding a National Garfield<lb/> Memorial Hospital&#44; in the City of Washington&#44; as a most fitting monument to the memory<lb/> of our late President.<lb/></p>
            <p>In furtherance of this purpose we beg to call your attention&#44; in a special manner&#44; to the<lb/> enclosed appeal referred to&#44; and to the accompanying recommendation of the Executive Com&#45;<lb/>mittee&#44; which has been endorsed by a pastor of each religious denomination in this City&#44; nam&#45;<lb/>ing November 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>&#44; or a day as near thereto as practicable&#44; be fixed for discourses<lb/> and collections in the usual places of worship&#44; by all the ministers and religious bodies through&#45;<lb/>out the United States.<lb/></p>
            <p>Believing that the measure will meet with your approval&#44; and hoping it may receive your<lb/> hearty co&#45;operation&#44; the appeal is made personal to you and your congregation.<lb/></p>
            <p>The names and character of most of the Executive Committee are known to the whole coun&#45;<lb/>try&#44; and will give assurance to the public that whatever funds may be contributed will be faith&#45;<lb/>fully and judicially applied&#44; and that they will at a proper time&#44; select a suitable and command&#45;<lb/>ing site for the nation&#39;s Garfield Memorial Hospital.  They may also be trusted with the<lb/> charge of seeing that the Institution in its architecture&#44; its construction&#44; and all its appoint&#45;<lb/>ments&#44; shall be equal to the best of its kind&#44; and commensurate in its dimensions and manage&#45;<lb/>ment with the generous contributions and the humane purposes of a patriotic people wishing to<lb/> erect an enduring and beneficent memorial to the late President GARFIELD&#44; and to <sic>empahsise</sic><lb/> their adherence to the principle of respecting persons in rightful authority&#44; and their abhor<lb/>ance of the crime of assassination.<lb/></p>
            <p>Contributions&#44; whether from individuals or by organized bodies&#44; should be sent to the Hon.<lb/> JAMES GILFILLAN&#44; Treasurer of the United States&#44; who is Treasurer of the Fund&#44; and by whom<lb/> they will be duly acknowledged.<lb/></p>
            <p><emph rend="italics">Should you deliver a discourse upon the theme and for the purpose suggested&#44; which may in whole<lb/> or in part be published&#44; be so good as to mail a copy to the Secretary of this Committee for its use.<lb/></emph></p>
            <p>Information bearing upon the founding of the national Garfield Memorial Hospital&#44; not<lb/> embraced in the enclosed appeal and recommendation&#44; will be cheerfully given when requested.<lb/></p>
            <p>With sentiments of the highest regard&#44; we remain yours very truly&#44;<lb/></p>

                APPEAL.<lb/>
                OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE<lb/>
                NATIONAL GARFIELD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL&#44;<lb/>
                1324 <emph rend="italics">F Street&#44; Washington&#44; D. C.&#44; October&#44;</emph> 1881.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Hon. JAMES G. BLAINE&#44; as Chairman of a Special Committee&#44; submitted the following<lb/> appeal&#44; which was unanimously adopted&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>The citizens of Washington and officials having residences here&#44; have united in a move&#45;<lb/>ment to do marked and enduring honor to the name of the late President&#44; whose great life was<lb/> so sadly and so tragically ended.<lb/></p>
            <p>His reputation as a statesman&#44; legislator and Executive was acquired in this Capital.  Be&#45;<lb/>yond his claims to admiration and gratitude&#44; he was personally beloved by all classes of citizens<lb/> throughout the whole country in a degree that rarely falls to the lot of any public man.<lb/></p>
            <p>Reflecting his own wishes so far as they may be inferred from his career and his charac&#45;<lb/>ter&#44; the memorial designed&#44; that of a National Hospital&#44; to be located in the District of Colum&#45;<lb/>bia&#44; to be known forever by his name&#44; is most suitable and appropriate.<lb/></p>
            <p>It will be a provision for the relief of human suffering&#44; from the cup of which he drank the<lb/> bitterest dregs&#44; and in the breadth of its human charity it will fitly typify the noble nature and<lb/> exalted aims of the hero and martyr.  The hospital is designed to be as wide in its scope of benef&#45;<lb/>icence as was the kindly heart of the dead President in its outstretch of human sympathies.  It<lb/> will be open to those needing its aid and ministrations without regard to class&#44; caste&#44; creed or<lb/> color.  To be a sufferer in need of help will be the only passport required to enter its doors and<lb/> secure its aid.  Such an institution&#44; founded in the cause of charity and bearing the name of<lb/> &#34;Garfield&#44;&#34; appeals to the generosity of every one&#44; and to every one the appeal is made.<lb/></p>
            <p>Contributions&#44; small and great&#44; are solicited&#44; and may be safely remitted to the Hon. JAMES<lb/> GILFILLAN&#44; Treasurer of the United States&#44; who has consented to act as Treasurer of the fund.<lb/></p>
            <p>He gives twice who gives quickly.  Let the response be prompt&#44; generous and universal.<lb/></p>
            <p>Very respectfully&#44;<lb/>
                General W. T. SHERMAN&#44; <emph rend="italics">Chairman</emph>.<lb/></p>
