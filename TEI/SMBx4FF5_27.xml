            <p>450 W. Randolph St.<lb/>
                Chicago&#44; July 5. 1887<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr. S. Morais&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Philadelphia.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear and sincerely venerated friend&#58;&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>Most heartily do I thank you for your kind letter.<lb/>  It is time&#44; there is that passage in the &#91;Hebrew&#93; to which<lb/> Zunz referred&#44; and which reads&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But Zunz<lb/> referred to Sec. <hi rend="underline">557</hi>&#44; and there I did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> find that pass&#45;<lb/>age in the edition Frankfurt &#91;&#63;&#93; Oder &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; 1783&#44; before<lb/> me.  However in a letter of Dr. Bettelheim&#44; Baltimore&#44;<lb/> which reached me this afternoon at the same time with<lb/> yours&#44; I was told to look in Sec. <hi rend="underline">603</hi>&#44; and there I would<lb/> find the sentence quoted above.  In explanation B. wrote<lb/> to me that 16 years ago Prof. Rosin&#44; Breslau&#44; published<lb/> a special work on the &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; its author&#44; its contents&#44; &#38;c.&#44;<lb/> &#40;a work which I do not possess&#44;&#41; and therein the<lb/> professor set also forth that the later editions of the<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; are differing from the three earliest editions<lb/> in their enumeration of the &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  And as it was<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p><hi rend="underline">2.</hi><lb/></p>
            <p>that Zunz&#44; who no doubt had the <hi rend="underline">editio princeps</hi><lb/> before him&#44; referred to Sec. 557&#44; while in my<lb/> copy the passage is in Sec. 603.  You&#44; dear Dr.&#44;<lb/> have now evidently a copy of one of the earlier<lb/> editions in your possession &#40;Venice 1523&#63; or ib. 1600&#63;<lb/> or Amsterdam 1721&#63;&#41;<lb/></p>
            <p>The book &#91;Hebrew&#93; to which you called my<lb/> attention&#44; I have never seen. The few extracts you<lb/> quoted from it in your esteemed letter&#44; are highly<lb/> interesting.  They are of the <hi rend="underline">very</hi> few passages<lb/> known to me which presuppose the existence somewhere<lb/> of a biennial cycle in &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The whole matter &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your questions&#44; my dear friend and<lb/> colleague&#45;&#45;please permit me to address you as &#34;my<lb/> friend&#34;&#45;&#45;your questions regarding the origin and<lb/> differentiation of the various manners and methods<lb/> of the Reading of the Torah&#44; of Dividing the same into<lb/> Parshiyoth&#44; of the selection of the Haftaroth&#44; &#38;c.&#44; can<lb/> hardly be answered forthwith and within the limits of<lb/> one letter&#59; at least not by me.  The subject is<lb/> rich&#44; and its study requires much time.  The<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p><hi rend="underline">3.</hi><lb/></p>
            <p>Guemara already offers very rich material.  There<lb/> is not only that well known passage&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Meg. 29&#44; b.&#41;&#44; from which we have<lb/> to conclude that in Palestine they read the Torah<lb/> in a Triennial cycle&#59; there are also witnesses<lb/> coming forward from whose testimony we must follow<lb/> that the One&#45;year&#45;cycle was also not unknown.  See&#44;<lb/> f. i.&#44; the Baraitha in Megillah 31&#44; b&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> There were in some congregations&#44; in the times of the &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> evidently still other methods of &#91;Hebrew&#93; <hi rend="underline">en vogue</hi>&#59; so in<lb/> some congregations they continued &#91;Hebrew&#93; where they<lb/> had stopped on &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and on the following Monday<lb/> they continued where they had stopped on Saturday after&#45;<lb/>noon&#44; &#38;c.&#44; while in other congregations it was other&#61;<lb/>wise&#44; similar to our present methods.  It seems<lb/> that not before the times of the &#91;Hebrew&#93; the methods<lb/> of &#91;Hebrew&#93; became fixed and settled.  However&#44; as I<lb/> said&#44; the matter is a rich one&#44; and I am not<lb/> equipped enough that I could treat it &#34;off&#45;hand.&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>And now permit me to ask you a question.<lb/>  Why will you not propose your questions to the<lb/> readers&#45;&#45;I mean to the scholars among the<lb/> readers&#45;&#45;of the <hi rend="underline">Menorah</hi>&#63;  I have your consent<lb/> already&#44; dear friend and colleague&#44; to publish<lb/> your letter either entirely or parts thereof in the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Menorah</hi>&#44; and I intend to do it.  But I would<lb/> greatly prefer it&#44; if you would send directly<lb/> your questions to the Editor&#44; Mr. Peixotto.<lb/></p>
            <p>Believe me&#44; if I sometimes write<lb/> for one or the other of our periodicals&#44; I do not<lb/> do it for any impure motive.  I do not do it<lb/> to satisfy a childish vanity to see my name in<lb/> print&#59;&#45;&#45;or in the belief that I am able<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  I write because<lb/> I am <hi rend="underline">urged</hi> to do it by befriended editors.  And<lb/> as I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> write&#44; I think I should at least<lb/> not offer such common thrash&#44; as is mostly done<lb/> by our Jewish papers&#44;&#45;&#45;&#34;mostly&#34;&#44; not by all.  My<lb/> query in the last number of the <hi rend="underline">Menorah</hi> was also<lb/> intended to induce some of our Rabbis and &#34;Rabbis&#44;&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p><hi rend="underline">5</hi><lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;there are two kinds of Rabbis&#44;&#45;&#45;Rabbis with and<lb/> Rabbis without quotation marks&#41; to turn their<lb/> minds towards earnest studies&#44; and not to squander<lb/> their time entirely with &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; with hateful<lb/> polemics &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38;c. &#38;c.<lb/></p>
            <p>But I must close now.  I see&#44; I<lb/> am getting a garrulous old man&#44; but you<lb/> must pardon me.<lb/></p>
            <p>Thanking you once more for your<lb/> kind letter&#44; I am remaining&#44; dear Sir&#44;<lb/> yours truly<lb/> B. Felsenthal<lb/></p>
