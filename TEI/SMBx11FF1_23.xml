            <p>For a Bar Mitzvah in connection with Austin Corbin&#39;s<lb/></p>
            <p>proscriptive declaration at <sic>Manahattan</sic> island.<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren.  Were I inclined to detain you with a lecture&#44; because<lb/> of the inauspicious day approaching&#44; I would direct your atten&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion not to my strictures&#44; but to the sermon preached in a sister<lb/> city.  That tells why the fast of Ab should still be observed&#44;<lb/> why we ought yet to lament the inefficacy of our fathers he&#45;<lb/>&#45;roism to in their struggle and to retain country and nationality.<lb/>  That sermon discloses how incredible as it may seem&#44; humiliating as it may be surely is&#44; Jews<lb/> remain even in America a proverb and by word&#59; a football<lb/> to multitudes.  We say it yearly Yearly&#44; under the shade of the Philadelphia state house I say it&#44; in the language of one of our<lb/> poets and utter but the truth &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/>  &#34;Whoever hears the name of Hebrew&#44; bears the stigma of reproach.&#34;<lb/>  No land is so free from that it has emancipated itself from the inveterate prejudice.  But is the contu&#45;<lb/>&#45;mely deserved&#63;  Aye&#58; a thousand times&#44; by reason of our recreancy&#44;<lb/> and because of our shameless lack of self&#45;respect.  I expressed<lb/> the thought this week to an esteemed correspondent&#44; and I<lb/> repeat it on this Sabbath preceding the memorial season of our<lb/> trespasses and sore trials.  Our people misled by their leaders&#44;<lb/> fancy that they will liberalize gentilism by casting at its<lb/> feet Mosaism and the traditions&#44; but nothing is accomplished<lb/> thereby&#44; nothing&#44; save <sic>apostacy</sic>proscription.  The closer we try to<lb/> draw to Christians by aping their practices&#44; the more are we<lb/></p>

            <p>repelled and contemned&#44; by under&#44; and the greater is the divine wrath at<lb/> the our unfaithfulness. of our trust.  Mark it well&#58; the<lb/> Synagogue where the name of the indivisible Duty is proclaimed&#44;<lb/> has been lately prostituted by its having invocations to the trinity&#44; invoked therein&#44;<lb/> but the popular feelings did not undergo a change.  Shepherds whose<lb/> sole duty it is to watch over the welfare of our their own flock<lb/> have wandered to strange fields and attended to sheep not<lb/> belonging to our their fold.  Each may say with the typical<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93; of the book of Canticle.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;They set me as a guardian of the vineyards&#44; but my own vineyard<lb/> I have not kept.&#34;  They have lectured to Protestants and to<lb/> Catholics&#44; to Unitarians and Free&#45;thinkers&#44; using the minor San&#45;<lb/>&#45;ctuary merely as the source&#44; whence to derive their revenue.<lb/>  All that and more has been done to conciliate and to win favor.<lb/>  Have those who differ from us in dogmas recognized through it then errors &#38;<lb/> acknowledged as their spiritual superiors preceptors&#63;<lb/>  Let Saratoga and Manhattan island &#91;&#63;&#93; answer.  Oh that<lb/> my poeple were wise and understood&#44; at least&#44; self&#45;respect&#33;<lb/>  They would not crave for the forbidden mess of pottage to<lb/> prove their liberal views&#45;&#45;thus exposing the whole race<lb/> to opprobrium.  Our heavenly Legislator is merciful.  Twice has the Ruler of Israel<lb/> sent given us a warning of his displeasure &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>

            <p>&#34;Behold all these things God will do twice&#44; thrice to man&#44; to<lb/> deliver men his soul from b destruction.&#34;  We have not heeded<lb/> the first sent two years ago will we mind the second founded in the same season&#44; or shall the third be necessary<lb/> to assure us that we can only lie at security in the bosom<lb/> of our venerable mother&#45;&#45;the Law of Sinai&#63;  Oh&#33;  Let us<lb/> not tempt the Lord&#44; like our ancestors&#44; lest He deprives<lb/> us of the stanchion of our support&#45;&#45;a republican America&#45;&#45;and make<lb/> the land of our boast a land of Nod&#44; in which we will be<lb/> regarded as aliens and intruders.  Remonstrances and conventions will not ward off the anger of our offended Lord.  But let us pacify Him by learning Let us learn<lb/> self&#45;respect socially not less than religiously.  I dare not<lb/> deny that the undignified conduct of some of our brethren<lb/> breeds prejudice and ill&#45;will.  Who can gainsay the<lb/> accusation of vulgarity in language and manners made advanced<lb/> by our adversaries&#63;  Pity that the innocent should<lb/> suffer with the gently&#44; but such has been our fate always<lb/> and so it will continue&#44; notwithstanding all that a<lb/> strained liberalism on our part may attempt to perform.<lb/>  Brethren&#33;  I did not intend to say even the little I have detained you<lb/> with&#44; but this subject coincident with the sad time of<lb/> our year has beguiled me into a semi&#45;sermon.  My ob&#45;<lb/>&#45;ject was to exhort our Bar Mitzvah to keep fast to the<lb/> promises he tacitly made&#44; being instructed by current events.<lb/></p>

            <p>My young brother friend&#33;  The Rabbis tell us that God holds<lb/> in His hand a seal upon which the word Emet &#91;Hebrew&#93; three letters are engraved.  They are the first<lb/> as engraved.  It means Truth&#44; and it is composed of three the middle and the last letter of the Hebrew Alphabet.  They denote Truth &#34;Emet&#34;.<lb/> letters which are the first&#44; the middle and the last of the<lb/> Hebrew Alphabet.  You understand the lesson that our Sages<lb/> mean purpose to teach by that figure of speech.  If you wish that<lb/> the Almighty gave put the signet of His approbation to on your deeds&#44; you must<lb/> begin&#44; continue and end your life with honesty. of purpose.  To day<lb/> you have signified&#44; by the ceremony you have gone through&#44; that<lb/> you intend to adhere to Judaism.  Had I not often&#44; too often alas&#33; in vain<lb/> lectured to your coevals on occasions like yours&#44; I would detain you with<lb/> explaining what I mean by honest Judaism&#44; but as you must<lb/> have heard me before&#44; I will limit my remarks by saying that the<lb/> principle to which I allude is to act up to your professions.  To<lb/> be a Jew and to despise the rules binding upon us&#59; to work when you<lb/> should rest&#44; and eat when you should fast&#44; and then claim that you<lb/> are as good as the best Israelite&#44; is to falsify your life and dishonor truth.<lb/>  Let me pray that you will not become culpable of that fault so rife<lb/> in our age.  Love your parents who&#44; after God&#44; have given you existence&#44;<lb/> support &#38; education&#44; but more than even your father and mother love that Being<lb/> who gives all His creatures numberless blessings&#44; and who commands nature to be our<lb/> servant&#44; obey our ordinances&#44; and procure us comforts&#44; pleasure &#38; delights.  May you merit<lb/> to enjoy them all&#44; &#38; the eyes of those to whom love are very dear you&#44; sparkle at the sight of the happiness<lb/> reserved for you in this land of the living.<lb/></p>
