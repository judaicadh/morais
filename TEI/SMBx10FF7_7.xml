            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Life is a gift from God&#44; and we should en&#45;<lb/>&#45;deavour to enjoy it within lawful bounds&#44; not<lb/> selfishly&#44; but broadly humanely&#44; fraternally.  Cloisters&#44;<lb/> mendicant orders&#44; celibacy are institutions that<lb/> never could strike root in Judaism.  To withdraw<lb/> from the world&#44; and devote the years allotted to<lb/> us by Providence here below&#44; to self&#45;imposed privations&#44;<lb/> in the hope of that we will ascending heaven&#44; by turning our<lb/> backs upon the earth&#59; to direct our minds eyes to the<lb/> contemplation of a future that has been most wisely<lb/> been veiled from human vision&#44; is the to misunder&#45;<lb/>&#45;stand religion&#44; in its spirit and in its very letter. &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/>  The sect of The Essenes&#45;&#45;whom we may term Jewish monks&#45;&#45;formed a sect which at one period of<lb/> our history existed in Judea but it was an excrescence on<lb/> our body politic.  The unfortunate condition of the<lb/> time gave it origin&#44; but and it was lost&#44; or it merged<lb/> in nascent Christianity&#44; because it was un&#45;Jewish.<lb/>  Its members who separated themselves from the com&#45;<lb/>&#45;munity&#44; and some of whom vowed not to marry&#44; were<lb/> in open war with the faith&#44; which this fancied to serve&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>and they were cut off perished from our midst because<lb/> their doctrines ill&#45;accorded with the principles underlying Mosaism.  You<lb/> have it heard your religion speak&#44; my Brethren&#44; and never has it<lb/> spoken more clearly than in connection with the<lb/> festival that Israelites greet everywhere this day.<lb/>  Let me quote once more in full the words of the archpro&#45;<lb/>&#45;phet as they occur in Deuteronomy Chap XVI. v. 14.<lb/>  &#34;Thou shalt rejoice in thy feast&#44; thou and thy son&#44; and<lb/> thy daughter and thy man&#45;servant&#44; and thy maid&#45;<lb/>servant&#44; and the Levite and the stranger and<lb/> the fatherless and the widow that are in thy<lb/> gates.&#34;  Mark it well.  In families&#44; not in<lb/> a state of voluntary and deliberate solitariness<lb/> can we enjoy the blessings of Him that makes the<lb/> soil smile with plenty.  In families&#44; which<lb/> Isaiah in his sublime outpourings&#44; calls the working<lb/> of God&#44; the very aim of the Creation &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> In families&#44; which the psalmist in his splendid<lb/> effusions prayed that pictured as they might increased innumer&#45;<lb/>ably &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But what constituted a man&#39;s<lb/> household in Israel&#44; simply those to whom he<lb/> gave material existence&#63;  O Ye that heedlessly<lb/> charge Judaism with the sin of which the world<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>is not yet purged&#33;  Pause and bethink yourselves.<lb/>  When slavery was every where engrafted on the<lb/> codes that governed society&#44; when Rome that<lb/> gave laws to the known world declared one<lb/> born in bondage pro quadrupedibes&#45;&#45;brute&#45;like&#44; the<lb/> Hebrews possessed a legislation&#44; coeval with the<lb/> ancient empire of Egypt&#44; which commanded<lb/> that the man&#45;servant and the maid&#45;servant receive<lb/> considerate attention and be cared for like the child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren of the family.  And here let me observe in passing&#44;<lb/> that the word &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;&#45;&#45;translated &#34;slaves&#44;&#34; is a term<lb/> free from any opprobrious meaning&#44; for it is ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;plied even to the highest officer in the kingdom&#44;<lb/> and &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; mostly used to signify a bond&#45;woman&#44;<lb/> is derived from &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; denoting family&#44; of which<lb/> she is a recognized member&#44; enjoying Sabbath<lb/> rest&#44; the national festivities&#44; and the same privi&#45;<lb/>&#45;leges that the Levite&#44; who did not possess an estate&#44;<lb/> could claim&#44; and the stranger who sought shelter<lb/> in Judea&#44; and whom we were enjoined to love like<lb/> ourselves&#44; and the orphan and the widow&#44; who<lb/> did not look for the alms doled out&#44; but expected bro&#45;<lb/>&#45;therly and sisterly beneficence in obedience to the Law.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Oh that they who have a noble heritage would<lb/> adequately value it &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Would that<lb/> they studied the code before whose spiritual bright&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness the statutes of the most renowned nations<lb/> pale.  Often &#38;c<lb/></p>
