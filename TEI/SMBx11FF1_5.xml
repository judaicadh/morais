            <p>Preface to a discourse for a Bar Mitzv&#225;<lb/></p>
            <p>Have you ever seen the confirmation&#63; a gift newly presented to your<lb/> age&#63;  I have not&#59; but I heard a flattering description thereof.<lb/>  You of course&#44; dear Brethren&#44; fully understand to what I have reference.<lb/>  I mean the introduction into the Synagogue of a practice&#44; with which<lb/> Hebrew ministers seek to conciliate the spirit of the time.  Now&#59;<lb/> I can readily imagine how gratifying the appearance of our young<lb/> daughters arrayed in spotless white&#44; wreathed and flowered must<lb/> be&#45;&#45;especially to their parents.  We all have more or less a leaning<lb/> to that weakness.  We all b are affected with a degree of vanity<lb/> touching the mental and bodily attractiveness of our offspring&#44; and<lb/> I could not condemn that failing without being myself in all like&#45;<lb/>&#45;lihood adjudged guilty.  But in determining about the admission<lb/> of a novel ceremony in religion we should consult higher feelings<lb/> than personal gratification.  We should inquire whether the<lb/> imposing sight&#45;&#45;if you desire so to term it&#45;&#45;bears corresponding<lb/> effects&#44; for&#44; if it is barren of happy results&#44; then the momentary<lb/> impression it creates&#44; should not suffice to decide in its<lb/> favor.  Dear Brethren&#33;  I believe that were we to follow<lb/> that process of reasoning regarding the matter at issue&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>we would soon discover the hollowness of that practice so much<lb/> extolled.  For&#44; divested of all its trappings&#44; it resolves itself<lb/> into this&#58; During a series of months young Jewesses are taught<lb/> a certain number of answers respecting the beauty and superiority<lb/> of their faith.  An invocation to the Deity or a brief address is<lb/> written for such as can display some elocutionary ability&#44; and<lb/> it is as often repeated as necessary to commit it to memory.<lb/>  On the festival of Pentecost our future wives and mothers are<lb/> presented with pomp&#44; before a large assemblage of their seniors&#44;<lb/> to the Rabbi preacher.  They are catechized&#59; they are<lb/> exhorted to remain faithful&#44; and a benediction is pronounced<lb/> over them all.  Now&#44; admitting that the examiner and those<lb/> whom he questions are true Israelites&#45;&#45;though I heard of instances<lb/> when the initiated were regaled with forbidden viands&#45;&#45;admit&#45;<lb/>&#45;ting&#44; I say&#44; that they are sincere&#44; can it be reasonably supposed<lb/> that that scene will conform the minds of the young in<lb/> the verities of Judaism&#59; confirm their hearts in righteousness&#63;<lb/>  Will not all the surroundings yield a contrary effect&#63;<lb/>  Will not those who by a long and weary teaching were prepared<lb/> exclusively for the occasion&#44; who were instructed how to<lb/> stand erect and how to bend&#44; will they not look upon the<lb/> performance&#44; as a mere pageantry&#44; intended to entertain<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>the spectators&#63;  And if&#45;&#45;as practised by some&#45;&#45;a<lb/> solemn pledge&#44; which they are incapable of appreciating&#45;&#45;<lb/>is exacted from the young&#44; a pledge that they will perpetrate<lb/> the Hebrew faith&#44; will that ceremony command itself to univer&#45;<lb/>&#45;sal acceptance&#63;  I think not.<lb/></p>
            <p>But I hear some of you observe that the objection I have<lb/> advanced regarding the confirmation&#44; applies equally to the<lb/> attaining of religious age or becoming Bar Mitzv&#225;h.  It is<lb/> painful for me to admit it&#44; but I have to acknowledge the<lb/> correctness of the remark.  Yes&#44; that time&#45;honored practice<lb/> also&#44; as performed in our days&#44; is unproductive of any moral<lb/> advantage.<lb/></p>
