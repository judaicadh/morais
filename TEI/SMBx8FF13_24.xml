            <p>My dear sir<lb/></p>
            <p>The veneration which I entertained for your mother &#40;of blessed memory&#41; and<lb/> the filial affection which you ever evinced&#44; prompt me to condole with you<lb/> for the loss you have sustained.  But although that sad <del>bereavement</del> event must naturally<lb/> be felt more keenly by the nearest relatives of the deceased than by others that are not<lb/> connected by the ties of consanguinity&#44; yet it evidently has cast a gloom over the whole<lb/> congregation.  The rare virtues which adorned your sainted mother&#44; had&#44; as you are fully<lb/> aware&#44; endeared her to every heart.  Even persons that might have differed from her<lb/> touching some religious practices&#44; could not but admire and respect her unassuming<lb/> piety.  And that amiability of temper&#44; that exquisite sense of charity which she<lb/> exhibited at all times and under all circumstances&#44; worked so beneficially on almost<lb/> every one who engaged her friendship&#44; that they will long lament her death.<lb/></p>
            <p>But I less than all can forget one&#44; whose character I admired and who had repeatedly<lb/> given me tokens of motherly attachment.  I look in vain for one that can replace<lb/> her&#44; for I sincerely declare that I do not know any that can equal her.  Still it is<lb/> to me some gratification to know&#44; that my attention towards that dear friend of mine&#44;<lb/> was consolatory to her.  The prayers which I recited for her&#44; and my replies to her eager<lb/> questions&#44; were the means of tranquillizing her mind&#59; for&#44; I cannot deny to you that<lb/> that pure soul which feared even the <hi rend="underline">shadow</hi> of sin&#44; accused herself for the dereliction<lb/> of some of her offspring&#59; and was disquieted by the thought that the Sovereign Judge of<lb/> human actions would visit upon her the errors they committed.  I endeavored to persuade<lb/> her that on that score she was clear from guilt&#44; and I hope successfully&#44; for subsequently<lb/> to that&#44; we could perceive from the motions of her lips&#44; when she was unable to give utterance<lb/> to her feelings&#44; that she communed with her God&#44; and besought this pardon for those<lb/> that have erred&#44; and for his continual protection to those of her children that kept the<lb/> path of Judaism.  May the Father of all have granted her petition&#44; and may He<lb/> afford heavenly consolation to those that mourn for the loss of one so righteous.<lb/></p>
            <p>I shall rejoice to learn that you are well&#44; and remember with a kindly thought<lb/> yours truly<lb/></p>
            </body>
