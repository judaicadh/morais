            <p>To the President and Trustees of the Jewish<lb/> Theological Seminary Association<lb/></p>
            <p>Gentlemen<lb/></p>
            <p>On Monday&#45;&#45;June 25th&#45;&#45;<lb/> a private examination of the students of<lb/> our institution was held in Room 31 of Cooper<lb/> Union.<lb/></p>
            <p>Of the ten pupils in the <sic>Preparotory</sic><lb/> class only seven were present.  I learnt<lb/> with regret that Isidor Cohen had been to<lb/> irregular as to warrant his being stricken<lb/> from the roll&#59; that Solomon Bernstein<lb/> is nearly as irregular&#44; and Raymond<lb/> Rubenstein&#44; though not so much at fault<lb/> in his attendance&#44; behaves badly.<lb/></p>
            <p>The examination was conducted principally<lb/> by myself in conjunction with Dr Kohut.<lb/></p>  
            <p>Emanuel and Joseph Hertz gave <del>the</del><lb/> <del>best</del> evidence of diligent appreciation to their <del>to</del> studies and<lb/> of natural capacities to retain what is<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>taught them.  They stood the<lb/> highest in their average in all branches&#59; viz&#44;<lb/> in 20 chapters of Genesis with Baslin&#59; 50<lb/> psalms&#59; history from Joshua to the death<lb/> of David&#59; Grammar&#59; Mishnah <hi rend="underline">Shabbath</hi> from chap 9 to 11<lb/> and Talmud Baba Mitzia&#44; from p 8 to 11.<lb/>  <del>Elias Barowsky&#44; may be placed next to the</del> David Wittenberg might rank with the<lb/> two brothers aforenamed&#44; <del>as regard history&#44; Mishna</del> were it not that <del>his</del><lb/> <del>and Ghemara English being very imperfect&#44;</del> he<lb/> cannot express his thoughts intelligibly owing to<lb/> his imperfect acquaintance with English.<lb/>  Elias Barowsky may be placed next as regard<lb/> history&#44; Mishnah and Ghemara&#44; and Bernard<lb/> Blankford stands somewhat below.  The latter<lb/> has a pleasing appearance&#44; but evidently<lb/> his looks betrayed excitement when he was<lb/> under examination.  Myer Levy and<lb/> Arnold Greenfield were found less proficient<lb/> than the rest.<lb/></p>
            <p>I can never too strongly recommend the<lb/> enforcing of Grammatical rules and diacritical marks in the<lb/> reading of the Hebrew&#44; and I would even<lb/> suggest that whole chapters and psalms<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>be memorized weekly and recited distinctly aloud so as to render<lb/> the pupils familiar with the original <del>text&#44;</del><lb/> <del>was about to and in the correct quotation of the</del> text readily and correctly&#44;<lb/> qualifying them&#44; in the Junior class&#44; Levias&#44; Fron<lb/> Frohnsen and Iron are equal respecting<lb/> the 16 chapters of Exodus with comments Heb<lb/>rew Grammar and Ghemara Challin&#45;8 pages&#45;&#38; Berachoth 106 but not equal<lb/> respecting the capacity <del>ability</del> of expression.  I was<lb/> pleased to notice an improvement in the<lb/> appearance and general address of Simpson&#44;<lb/> as I remembered how wanting he was in<lb/> both when admitted into the seminary.<lb/>  Friedlander did not average as high <del>Specker&#44; or Speaker&#44; is anxious to be en</del><lb/> as the rest but he is anxious to rise up <del>rolled among our students.  He has often</del><lb/> to the same standard.  Speaker&#44; or Specker has<lb/> often applied to me and begged that he<lb/> may be enrolled among our students.  <del>His</del><lb/> <del>address</del> Clearly he has a good knowledge<lb/> of Talmud and&#44; I might add also&#44; of Bible&#44; but<lb/> his English is very bad&#44; and his appearance<lb/> is not prepossessing.  He may possibly<lb/> be of service hereafter <del>in the cap</del> as teacher.<lb/>  I doubt his ability to as use the pulpit<lb/></p>

            <p>with &#91;&#63;&#93; to himself and with benefit to<lb/> Judaism in America.  I met for the<lb/> first time at the private examination Halper.<lb/>  He is a young Talmudist&#44; needing a better<lb/> acquaintance with other branches of our litera<lb/>ture&#44; and our vernacular language.  I believe he is<lb/> simply a listener at the seminary<lb/> Drs Drachman in the Preparatory class and Dr<lb/> Lieberman in the Junior devote themselves<lb/> with zeal to the <del>performance</del> <sic>fulfilment</sic> of their task&#44;<lb/> but it is natural to all who are engaged<lb/> in the performance of so responsible an<lb/> undertaking as theirs&#44; to feel encouraged by<lb/> the occasional visits of Directors and Trustees<lb/> at the sessions.  I crave for that en&#45;<lb/>couragement given by all who have united<lb/> with me in the promotion of a holy cause.<lb/>  Yours faithfully<lb/> S. Morais<lb/></p>
