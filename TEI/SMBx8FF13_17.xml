            <p><hi rend="underline">In the Ledger</hi><lb/></p>
            <p>Mr &#91;&#63;&#93; Tyons paper noted for its caution in circulating reports<lb/> of doubtful authenticity has&#45;&#45;inadvertently&#45;&#45;on Tuesday last trans&#45;<lb/>ferred to its columns a piece of news of a character as false<lb/> as it was startling to the Jewish public.  My coreligionists<lb/> must have indeed rubbed their eyes&#44; imagining they were not<lb/> fully aroused from their slumbers&#44; when they read <del>on Tuesday</del><lb/> last that a government of their own has&#45;&#45;for the last<lb/> three years&#44; existed within the borders of North America.<lb/>  Strange&#33; that a knowledge so important to the house of<lb/> Israel&#44; should have been withheld from those who spiritually<lb/> guide it.  Myself and colleagues ought early to have been<lb/> made acquainted therewith.  For we might have prepared<lb/> our respective congregations against the day of a general exodus<lb/> from America towards the land of &#91;&#63;&#93;.  We might<lb/> have <del>employed</del> exercised our persuasive eloquence in urging them<lb/> to invest largely in the &#34;loans&#34; about to be issued by<lb/> their &#34;government&#34; rather than a U. S. bond.<lb/></p>
            <p>The idea is supremely ludicrous&#44; and yet fraught with<lb/> mischief.  It <del>may</del> must have emanated either from<lb/> a diseased brain&#44; or from a spirit intensely malignant.<lb/>  In either case&#44; I regret its having found unmerited accep&#45;<lb/>&#45;tance among respectable journalists.  Many of<lb/> my christian neighbors may have a hearty laugh<lb/> over it&#59; but some more credulously inclined&#44; will<lb/> perchance put faith in it&#44; and be induced to look<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>suspiciously on their Jewish fellow&#45;man <del>and</del> may well distrust<lb/> his professions of loyalty to the constitution.  I have<lb/> therefore been impelled to say&#58; that American Israelites<lb/> own allegiance solely and exclusively to the laws that<lb/> govern this union&#59; that they are not engaged in any<lb/> emigration scheme by which Palestine may be repeopled<lb/> of its ancient possessors.  Without doubt may the future<lb/> <sic>fulfilment</sic> of what their prophets <del>the</del> have foretold they<lb/> leave the advent of their national reconstruction in the<lb/> hand of Him who will bring it to pass in His own good time.<lb/>  Meanwhile they desire attending&#45;&#45;unmolested&#45;&#45;to the<lb/> cultivation of the arts of peace in a country which has<lb/> recognized their manhood&#44; and where&#45;&#45;in common with all<lb/> its inhabitants they enjoy civil and religious freedom.<lb/>  They are grateful to God that their lot has been cast in<lb/> pleasant regions&#34;&#44; and proud of being able to acknowledge<lb/> themselves citizens of this republic.  In a word&#58; they are<lb/> Jews in the Synagogue and at home&#58; Americans in all<lb/> their social and political relations.<lb/>  S. Morais<lb/></p>
