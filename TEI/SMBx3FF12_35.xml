            <p>Rev. S. Morais<lb/>
                Most esteemed Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I was very <lb/> pleasantly <sic>surprized</sic> by the unexpected receipt<lb/> of your letter and felt myself extremely honored<lb/> to be asked to cooperate in such a valuable <lb/> and desirable undertaking as the estab&#45;<lb/>lishment of the Rabbinical Seminary in<lb/> question&#44; by one whose long and faithful<lb/> services have gained him such a good and<lb/> widely extended name&#44; The pleasure which<lb/> the receipt of you letter gave me was much<lb/> heightened by the fact that I have been ex&#45;<lb/>tremely anxious to enter into correspondence<lb/> with you&#44; dear Sir&#44; upon this very subject and<lb/> similar ones and would long since have<lb/> done so had not a natural diffidence lest<lb/> such action upon the part of one so comparatively<lb/></p>

            <p>young an unknown in American Judaism<lb/> as I be looked upon as unbecoming and<lb/> out of place presented me. But now that you&#44;<lb/> Reverend Sir&#44; have opened the matter I feel happy<lb/> to assure you that I am entirely willing&#44; in fact<lb/> eager to do all in my power to further the<lb/> matter in hand as well as any other move&#45;<lb/>ment tending to unite and strengthen the<lb/> cause of Conservatism. It is my firm<lb/> conviction that the cause of a true and<lb/> faithful Judaism can only be jeopardized<lb/> and injured by whole <del>and</del> or partial alliance<lb/> with Radicalism as it shows itself in this <lb/> land. Radicalism has entirely departed from<lb/> the historical path&#44; it is entirely our of sympathy<lb/> with the past&#44; it is practically nothing but<lb/> the ratification of caprice and license. Theor&#45;<lb/>etically the Union of the conservative elements<lb/> in this country is possible and I hope and pray<lb/> that personal or particular consideration will<lb/></p>

            <p>not be allowed to render it practically impossible.<lb/> We know now what conservatism means&#44; it in&#45;<lb/>cludes all who acknowledge the bindingness<lb/> of revelation and the Law&#44; מאהאפת ותורתו אמת and<lb/> it would be a great pity if petty differences<lb/> of a subordinate nature would render impracticable<lb/> the fusion of these elements. If the proposed Rabb&#45;<lb/> inical Seminary be established&#44; I hope it will<lb/> be modeled upon the Breslau Seminary &#94; at which<lb/> I have had the honor of going through my<lb/> course of studies and whose methods I am<lb/> convinced are the best adapted for doing jus&#45;<lb/>tice both to the spirit of the age and of Jud&#45;<lb/>aism. But this is merely a suggestion. In<lb/> any event I am prepared to &#94; do all I can in the<lb/> way of teaching or financial assistance as<lb/> far as my time&#44; the location of the institut&#45;<lb/>ion or the means of the congregation will<lb/> allow. As for my personal convictions you<lb/> may be sure that they are in full accordance<lb/></p>

            <p>with my writings and I have always en&#45;<lb/>deavored to live as far as possible in the<lb/> way  &#94;  which the examples of our ancestors have<lb/> made dear to believing and observant Israelites.<lb/> My congregation&#44; Oheb Shalom of Newark&#44; is<lb/> managed on strictly conservative principles and<lb/> according to the  &#91;Hebrew&#93; with no change except<lb/> the introduction of family pews&#44; kaddish by both<lb/> sexes &#38; the omission of some &#91;&#63;&#93; on the holidays.<lb/> Even these changes were made before my election and I<lb/> shall use every effort to keep the congregation on the<lb/> old lines. Thus far I am happy to state that I have the<lb/> sympathy of the congregation which <del>numbers&#91;&#63;&#93;</del> contains quite a<lb/> number of sincerely pious and well informed members.<lb/> Thanking you for the favor of your letter and assur&#45;<lb/> ing you of my cordial cooperation&#44; I am<lb/></p>                <p>very truly &#38; sincerely yours<lb/>
