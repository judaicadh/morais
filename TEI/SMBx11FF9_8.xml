            <p>For a funeral.<lb/></p>
            <p>The most remarkable illustration of optimism in<lb/> the Jewish religion&#44; is the very initial chapter of the<lb/> Hebrew Bible.  Six times we are made to read in it that<lb/> the Creator declared every thing issued from His sovereign<lb/> will&#44; &#34;good&#34;&#44; and at the completion of His handiwork<lb/> God put his seal upon it&#44; stamped with the indelible<lb/> words &#34;very good&#34;.  Why&#44; is this world of ours free from<lb/> evils&#63;  Do our eyes rest on frequent causes of satisfact&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion&#44; pleasure&#44; and delight&#63;  Pessimists will deny that.<lb/>  Men who use a telescope which may not discover glories&#44;<lb/> but only black spots in the quickening fortifying and cheer&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing messenger of light&#44; men who look through a micro&#45;<lb/>&#45;scope that may find poison in delicious fruits&#44; insects<lb/> in refreshing drinks&#44; such individuals insist that Moses<lb/> ought to have ended his panoramic description thus&#58;<lb/> &#34;God saw all which He had done&#44; and lo&#33; it was very bad.&#34;<lb/>  Again&#58; religionists who believe with a firm faith that<lb/> this life is only probationary&#44; and that mortals are pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;destined to be tormented&#44; in order that they may be happy<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>hereafter&#44; contend that gloom and suffering become so&#44;<lb/> that the ladder which leads heavenward&#44; has narrow steps&#44;<lb/> round which biting snakes and scorpions are coiling.<lb/>  Not so we who believe in a God of love&#44; not we who behold<lb/> in nature the product of beneficent Maker&#44; supplying<lb/> inexhaustible springs of delights &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> But leaving aside the beauties that charm our vision&#44;<lb/> the grandeur in nature that fills us with profound reverence&#44;<lb/> can any of us reckon the hours&#44; the days&#44; the weeks&#44; per&#45;<lb/>&#45;haps the months and years which greatly flowed&#44; carrying<lb/> us through unruffled tides of prosperity and felicity&#63;<lb/>  Ah&#33; we are too apt to recall what gave us pain&#44; and<lb/> become perfectly oblivious of the occasions which brought<lb/> us joy&#33;  Hence it is that we have constant mur&#45;<lb/>&#45;murings&#44; and few thanksgivings.  Nay more&#44;<lb/> we&#44; who may not&#44; like our deceased brother&#44; have ex&#45;<lb/>perienced numerous reverses&#44; lament when we should<lb/> offer praises to Providence&#44; for we are fertile in inven&#45;<lb/>&#45;tions&#44; very able in magnifying causes for regret.  What<lb/> is the love and fidelity of a wife&#44; the endearments of child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren&#44; the respect of the upright&#44; in comparison with the<lb/> gratification attending the possession of wealth&#63;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>So we falsely reason&#59; but when I read my bible<lb/> I find that prophets and psalmists and moralists<lb/> in unison of sentiments extol the blessings of home&#44;<lb/> the affection of our life companion&#44; the devotion of<lb/> our sons and daughters&#44; the regard of the righteous&#44;<lb/> deeming them veritable happiness&#44; and content&#45;<lb/>ment imperishable riches &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p> 
            <p>But then we must die&#44; we cry&#44; we that complain<lb/> of the tribulations which beset us in this life&#44; mourn<lb/> in anticipation because we have to quit it&#44; but what<lb/> of that&#63;  Tell an infant that he will grow to be<lb/> a man with bright faculties&#44; capable of rendering<lb/> his tiny being remarkable in future years&#44; famous<lb/> perchance&#44; immortal upon earth.  He will not<lb/> realize that possibility&#44; neither can we&#44; children<lb/> of an older growth&#44; realize how the spirit within<lb/> us&#44; the spirit which impels us&#44; for surely there is<lb/> a spirit in man&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; the spirit<lb/> without which we would be simply automatons&#44;<lb/> he cannot realize&#44; I say&#44; that we will live in a higher<lb/> and more <sic>developped</sic> existence.  But even here&#44;<lb/> to have reached a stage beyond the term usually<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>allotted to mortals&#44; to have died with light pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;monitions&#44; not terrifying&#44; not agonizing&#44; and to have<lb/> passed from earth to heaven instantaneously&#44; is a well<lb/> founded cause for satisfaction.  Even more&#44; to feel that<lb/> wife and children and relatives will drop tears of affect&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion&#44; that they will embalm the memory of the departed<lb/> in their hearts&#44; that it will remain ineffaceably as that<lb/> of a cherished husband and father and friend&#44; is a foretaste<lb/> of paradise.  Well&#58; I shall not intrude upon the sor&#45;<lb/>&#45;row of the bereaved&#44; nor will I weary with an oration&#59; I ea&#45;<lb/>&#45;gerly wish that my desultory remarks suggested by the me&#45;<lb/>&#45;lancholy occasion&#44; may prove some restorative balm to<lb/> those who have lost an object of conjugal and filial<lb/> solicitude.  May the mourners derive comfort from the<lb/> belief of our indestructibility&#44; in from the faith of Moses<lb/> who taught us that God&#44; is the Author of the spirit of all<lb/> flesh and from deeds of goodness.  Grant O Lord that<lb/> the soul of Thy servant G V A may have ascended the<lb/> realms of eternity purified of all dross&#44; cleansed by trials&#44;<lb/> imparadised by virtues will which it practised while clothed<lb/> in flesh&#44; &#38; in the language of David it may say&#58; &#34;Yea tho&#39;<lb/> I walk through the valley of the shadow of death&#44; I shall fear<lb/> no evil&#44; for Thou &#40;O Lord&#41; art with me&#34;  Amen<lb/></p>
