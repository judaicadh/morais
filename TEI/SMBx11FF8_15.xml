            <p>For a funeral<lb/>
                Brethren.<lb/></p>
            <p>Those who&#44; like myself&#44; know the history of Jules A.<lb/> Ephraim since his arrival in this land&#44; will agree<lb/> that my silence respecting it&#44; is an act of kindness to a<lb/> disconsolate family.  I might&#44; now that unhappily that history<lb/> has so untimely indeed&#44; eulogize industry and perseverance&#44;<lb/> early meeting with due reward&#44; but I would be unavoidably<lb/> led to describe subsequent reverses&#44; and losses and trials<lb/> of mind and body&#44; under which the human frame<lb/> at length sank irrecoverably.  I would thus deepen a sore<lb/> wound.  Far be it from me to add to the distress&#44;<lb/> which desolate hearts experience.  If I cannot<lb/> elicit tears which will relieve suffering&#44; I shall not<lb/> draw forth tears of anguish.  But while<lb/> compassionate feelings&#44; which you all share with me&#44;<lb/> ask that I shall say nothing about the temporal concerns<lb/> of our deceased brother&#59; neither a bout the causes of prospe&#45;<lb/>&#45;rity nor those of adversity&#44; a sense of justice demands<lb/> that I shall speak of qualities which will secure to<lb/> Jules A. Ephraim a remembrance for good among his<lb/> people and the community in whose midst he<lb/> lived.<lb/></p>
            <p>It was a belief with some of our ancient teachers that<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>the lips which have closed in death&#44; will open and move plea&#45;<lb/>&#45;surably&#44; when the living repeat the religious sayings of<lb/> the departed.  I have no maxim or law to tell in<lb/> the name of our lamented brother.  He was not a sage&#44;<lb/> nor a saint whom I may quote&#44; but I have evidences<lb/> of his generous character to show&#44; and I trust that<lb/> my pointing them out&#44; will gladden his immortal<lb/> spirit&#44; and that this will respond approvingly to my<lb/> truthful utterances.  Jules A. Ephraim was<lb/> benevolent.  To contribute largely to institutions of charity<lb/> was to him a necessity.  He must respond to follow his heart&#39;s<lb/> best instincts&#59; to refuse would have been to do violence<lb/> to his nature.  Therefore his name appeared not simply<lb/> on the list of donors&#44; but on that of active workers&#44;<lb/> always leaning towards on the side of mercy&#44; even when the appli&#45;<lb/>&#45;cants had but doubtful claims to assistance.<lb/>  It might be thought that to give of his means to public organiza&#45;<lb/>&#45;tions which aid the poor&#44; and orphans&#44; the sick and<lb/> the aged&#44; and to further benefit them by personal coo&#45;<lb/>&#45;peration&#44; was considered by our brother the completion<lb/> of his duty.  But if the recipients of his private<lb/> kindness could gather here&#44; we would see throngs<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>come forth and lay crowns of charity over this coffin.<lb/>  For our brother could not refuse deny the humblest among<lb/> his fellow creatures succour&#44; and never minding personal<lb/> discomfort he would make room at his own table for<lb/> the stranger and the wayfarer&#44; receiving all affably.<lb/>  And this is the trait most laudable in Jules A. Ephraim&#39;s<lb/> character.  When in the height of success&#44; he remained<lb/> lowly in spirit.  No act betraying assumption or an<lb/> arbitrary disposition emanated from him.  Posts of honor<lb/> in societies he received as offices of sacred trust&#44; and not<lb/> as means for self&#45;aggrandizement.  To the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;gregation with which he became connected&#44; at the beginning<lb/> of his career in this country&#44; and to which he remained<lb/> attached from principles&#44; my deceased friend was indeed<lb/> a liberal member.  And what is more noticeable and<lb/> more praiseworthy in this age of utilitarianism&#44; when all<lb/> is sacrificed to an imaginary happiness&#44; which after all<lb/> is but a will of with a wisp&#44; Jules A. Ephraim attended<lb/> Divine service&#44; and set aside worldly pursuits&#44; he became<lb/> a live worshipper and not a mute spectator&#44; and felt pride<lb/> in preserving a house of prayer in its imposingness.<lb/>  Hence it is that his absence from the Sanctuary by<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>reason of physical disability was a loss sensibly<lb/> felt.  I lamented it because few are those who&#44; like Jules<lb/> A. Ephraim can or will join understandingly and heartily in<lb/> the national offering of Israel to their God.  He has now been<lb/> transferred above where the choral hymns of the righteous<lb/> extol the universal Creator&#44; but his congregation will<lb/> miss him&#44; a numerous circle of friends will miss him&#44; and<lb/> who more than his sorely tried wife&#44; and his bereaved children<lb/> shall look to fill the void created&#44; and long feel distressed<lb/> because Jules A. Ephraim is no more&#63;  For them my<lb/> heart yearns.  I who have watched the risinge and the fall&#44;<lb/> the joys and the sorrows&#44; I that have participated in<lb/> the pleasures&#44; and grieved at the afflictions of my friend&#39;s<lb/> household&#44; wish it were in my power to lessen the burden<lb/> of misfortune.  But I can only pray&#44; and that I fervently<lb/> do for the consolation of Mrs Ephraim.  May she find some<lb/> compensation to her past suffering in the devotion of her child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren and her children&#39;s children.  May all who belong to<lb/> her vie with each other in making her latter days calm and<lb/> serene.  May the practical sympathy of friends and relatives prove<lb/> a solace to her heart.  Eternal Lord&#33;  Vouchsafe to bestow Thy loving<lb/> kindness on the family of Thy servant Ephraim son of Joseph&#44; &#38; apportion to him abundant mercies&#44;<lb/> as a reward for his beneficence&#44; his love of Thy Law&#44; and his endeavour to perform<lb/> its precepts.  Grant that his name be perpetuated in Israel&#44; through there &#38; &#38;c &#38;c.<lb/></p>
