            <p>Sheriff before when Victoria was<lb/> a maiden.&#41; I am astonished at<lb/> the Reformers do they ever forget<lb/> how bitter Sir Moses was against<lb/> reform many years ago when poor<lb/> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Raphael &#40;I mean D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hershell<lb/> may his soul rest in peace was alive&#41;<lb/> why even in this very city many many<lb/> years ago when they first wanted<lb/> Reform I said if Sir Moses would<lb/> countenance it I should not  &#38; they <lb/> all laughed me to scorn. Altho I had<lb/> done so much for them &#40;Today they make<lb/> a great celebration it  is the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Anvers<hi rend="sup">y</hi>.<lb/> of <hi rend="underline">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

            <p>Mr. A.A. Marcus.<lb/>
                Dear Sir.&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>The model of an Engine<lb/> which you considered so appropriately <sic>suted</sic> for a<lb/> gift to the venerable Sir Moses. I am happy to say<lb/> is near completion. I hope within two or three weeks<lb/> to have the same ready for shipment. You desire<lb/> me to give a description which is a model of Steam<lb/> Fire Engine made by George William Clark<lb/> formerly apprenticed to Messrs Lambert &#38; Son<lb/> London. Residing in Boston 16 years&#44; it took<lb/> seven months to make it from a model Salem St.<lb/> Steamer No. 8. The boiler is copper works&#44; parts are<lb/> steel&#44; the bulk in brass&#44; nickel plate&#44; the height to<lb/> the top is 18 inches&#44; length abou 20 inches&#44; with 16th<lb/> hole in the <sic>nozle</sic> pipe. It will throw twenty&#45;seven<lb/> feet stream. It has double active pumps&#44; steam<lb/> whistle&#44; safety valve and can be attached to any<lb/> steam boiler&#44; it has a fluted boiler&#91;.&#93; Although I am<lb/> maker of the model I doubt if any other Mechanic<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="6"/>
            <p>can equal or if there is patience enough in the brain<lb/> of any other mechanic to duplicate it&#44; the price you<lb/> paid I will give as a bonus to any other fellow<lb/> craftsman who will undertake to make so perfect<lb/> a model in one year&#44; you think probably that seven<lb/> months is a long time to perfect it. The designs<lb/> were first made of wood.<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours truly&#44;<lb/>
                George W. Clark.<lb/></p>
