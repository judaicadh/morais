            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>The seat in the house of prayer is vacant&#59; the hand which<lb/> gave a friendly pressure lies motionless&#59; the lips which that<lb/> spoke kindly are sealed in death.  My feelings have been<lb/> wrought up by this sudden decease departure&#59; my sympathies are<lb/> deeply stirred&#59; yet&#44; I must hold back the sentiments which<lb/> would force out laments.  One thought alone shall rule my<lb/> speech&#44; the thought that the family of Wolf Steppacher have<lb/> cause for comfort in their sore bereavement.  The Israelite&#44; the<lb/> husband&#44; the father&#44; lives and will continue to live in among the com&#45;<lb/>&#45;munity of his brethren&#44; in whose midst he dwelt and acted.<lb/>  I shall not venture upon a comparison which might justly<lb/> be deemed overdrawn even may&#44; even unbecoming but as I but in bringing back to mind the<lb/> closing portion of in the book of Genesis read last Sabbath&#44;<lb/> I instinctively recalled the allegorical teaching of an olden<lb/> sage of Israel our people.  He declared that Jacob&#44; the father of<lb/> the chosen tribes&#44; did not die&#44; and still the description of<lb/> his having passed away&#44; of his having been prepared for<lb/> burial&#59; the description of the lamentations uttered by the survivors&#44; and<lb/> of the seven days of mourning kept&#44; is given in detail in the same<lb/> portion of the first holy volume.  Can it then<lb/> be said true that Jacob the patriarch did not share the fate of all other<lb/> mortals&#63;  No&#58; if in his demise nothing was had been left<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>save the embalmed flesh&#44; bones and sinews powerless&#44; &#38; senseless&#44; then<lb/> the patriarch was dead&#44; stone dead&#44; but he did leave<lb/> behind the elements of a deathless existence&#58; even<lb/> upon earth&#44; his progeny kept him alive on earth by<lb/> eternizing the faith which had sustained their father.<lb/>  How touching the legend connected with relating to the parting<lb/> of Jacob with his children&#33;  A thought disturbs<lb/> the parent in his last hour.  Perhaps his offspring<lb/> are not of the same mind in the belief of the<lb/> Unity&#59; perchance the association of gentilism has<lb/> shaken them in their attachment to their creed.  But he is soon<lb/> reassured.  With singleness of heart&#44; his sons exclaim<lb/> &#34;Hear O Israel&#44; the Lord is our God&#44; the Lord is One&#34;<lb/> and the expiring sire said joyfully adds&#58; &#34;Blessed be the name of<lb/> His glorious Kingdom for ever and ever.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Now I shall not commit the impropriety of likening<lb/> my deceased coreligionist Wolf Steppacher to the sainted pa&#45;<lb/>&#45;triarch&#44; whose departure from this world is<lb/> graphically pictured in the section of last Saturday&#44;<lb/> but I am justified&#44; so I do hope&#44; I am justified<lb/> in declaring that while his spirit will exist imparadised<lb/> in a higher sphere&#44; his three sons will not suffer<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>his memory to die from among the community of<lb/> Israel in the city of Philadelphia.  Judged by<lb/> the Mosaic standard&#44; the deceased departed was not irre&#45;<lb/>&#45;proachable&#45;&#45;and who can boast so to me&#63;&#45;&#45;&#44; but of being spotlessly pious&#44; still he<lb/> rejoiced because those who have issued from him&#44; stand firm<lb/> in the ancestral belief.  One month ago&#44; I<lb/> visited this house&#44; now overspread with the gloom<lb/> of affliction.  Gladness shed its light therein<lb/> upon that day&#44; and that now he who lies enshrouded<lb/> in this coffin&#44; felt happy because his young&#45;<lb/>&#45;est son had attained his religious majority.<lb/>  He spoke of his children in the fulness of right&#45;<lb/>&#45;eous anticipations.  He was sustained by the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;viction that they would not degenerate&#44; and cast their<lb/> lots among strangers to the belief for whose pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;servation our predecessors suffered untold trials.<lb/>  And I rejoiced with him.  The Israelite the tender father<lb/> has gone&#44; the affectionate husband had to res&#45; received<lb/> &#45;pond to the summons which transferred him<lb/> above&#44; but could I become the interpreter of his<lb/> sentiments when I would say&#58; in his language Sons of Wolf Steppacher&#44;<lb/> a sad but sacred task has this melancholy event<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>imposed upon you by this melancholy event.  Your widowed mother must<lb/> partly find in you the arm on which she leaned for support.<lb/>  You are bound by the laws of God&#44; and the dictates of hu&#45; nature<lb/> &#45;manity to exercise profound devotion that the sorrow<lb/> under which she bends may be relieved&#44; but you owe<lb/> it also to your father&#39;s memory to show everlasting<lb/> fidelity to the religion which acknowledges God as the<lb/> sole Creator&#44; the Lawgiver and saviour of mankind.  Vow<lb/> at this solemn hour eternal allegiance to the faith<lb/> of Jacob&#44; promise to resist the allurements which<lb/> beset the path of our youths&#44; as they proceed<lb/> in the career of manhood&#44; and you will have<lb/> given secured for the Israelite&#44; who delighted in being called your<lb/> father&#44; a name which will never die in the commu&#45;<lb/>&#45;nity of our people.  Give the lie to the charge that<lb/> American Jews desert their ranks with facility&#44; to<lb/> enter array themselves against the defenders of Monotheism&#44;<lb/> for the sake of gaining popularity.  Be true to your<lb/> ancestry&#44; and let this very trial&#44; so severe&#44; and<lb/> so grievous&#44; purify your hearts sevenfold&#44; and make<lb/> you worthy children of a father immutably<lb/> attached to the religion of Israel.  &#40;Here follows a prayer.&#41;<lb/></p>
