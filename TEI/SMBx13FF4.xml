            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen.<lb/></p>
            <p>A curious book came out of issued from the press in Am&#45;<lb/>&#45;sterdam 230 years ago.  Its author had enjoyed a<lb/> world&#45;wide reputation through an act&#44; which had been historical event<lb/> credited mainly to his courageous piety&#44; till within eleven<lb/> months ago.  It was a surprise to me to have<lb/> read a positive assertion&#44; that the resettlement of<lb/> Jews in Great Britain in the middle of the XVIIth century is not<lb/> principally due to be ascribed to Menasseh Ben Israel&#59; that an<lb/> English woman&#44;&#45;&#45;a widow named Johannah Cartwright<lb/> and her son Ebenezer&#44; residents of Holland&#44; took the<lb/> initiative to bring it about&#44; with a by a petition to the lord Protector&#44; possibly with<lb/> a <sic>proselytising</sic> object&#59; and that a certain Manuel<lb/> Martinez Dormido&#44; evidently a Marrano or secret<lb/> Jew&#44; sent a memorial to the Cromwell to the explain&#45;<lb/> &#45;ing the commercial advantages of the readmission&#44; one<lb/> year before the Amsterdam Rabbi wrote his own in<lb/> the French language.<lb/></p>
            <p>Modern researches are&#44; in all reality&#44; busily engaged in<lb/> reshaping history.  Accordingly&#44; our knowledge of<lb/> of old <sic>ocurrences</sic>&#44; is&#44; at best&#44; clothed in severe doubts.<lb/>  It even stands  the danger of being proved bare fiction.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>But leaving aside the question of precedence<lb/> or effectiveness&#44; touching that transaction of so much<lb/> importance to our own people&#59; Menasseh Ben Israel de&#45;<lb/>&#45;serves well of the literary world&#44; by reason of his<lb/> untiring exertions.  He should ought not to be lightly<lb/> esteemed.  If he is wanting in originality&#44; none<lb/> dare deny his versatility&#59; because he was impract&#45;<lb/>&#45;ical in some of his views&#44; I will not admit im&#45;<lb/>&#45;putations reflecting upon his sincerity.  Menasseh<lb/> Ben Israel loved his religion and his people profoundly&#44;<lb/> and in their service he wrote voluminously and<lb/> learnedly&#44; in various languages of which he could<lb/> claim perfect mastery.  The curious book<lb/> to which I have reference and which he entitled<lb/> Esperanza de Isr&#224;el&#44; or &#34;Hope of Israel&#44;&#34; was pu&#45;<lb/>&#45;blished in Spanish.  I have not seen it tran&#45;<lb/>&#45;slated&#44; though I am informed that many a<lb/> version exists.<lb/></p>
            <p>We may be apt to smile at the credulity of the<lb/> writer&#44; as disclosed in that production&#44; but in<lb/> judging our predecessors without bias&#44; we must measure<lb/> them by their standard&#44; not by ours own.<lb/></p>

            <p>At a time when the heavens with their comets<lb/> and eclipses&#59; the earth with its physical and political revolu&#45; quackings<lb/> &#45;tions&#59; when the Eastern continent was brimful<lb/> of prognostics&#44; encouraging in the Jew the idea<lb/> of a coming the approaching advent of the Messiah&#59; when even the now<lb/> idolized phantheist&#44; Benedict Spinoza of Amster&#45;<lb/>&#45;dam&#44; hearing of the daring acts of Shabbethai Zebi&#45;&#45;<lb/> the imposter&#44; half credulously conceded the possi&#45;<lb/>&#45;bility of an approaching a speedy <sic>fulfilment</sic> of some prophetic<lb/> predictions&#44; the Esperanza de Isr&#224;el&#44; or &#34;Hope of<lb/> Israel&#44;&#34; must have been inspired by strong faith.<lb/>  The volume opens with a weird report brought<lb/> to Holland in 1644 by Aaron Levy of Villaflor<lb/> in Portugal&#44; a Marrano who bore the Christian name of Anto&#45;<lb/>&#45;nio de Montecinos.  Our author asserts to have<lb/> conversed with the tourist and have heard him swear<lb/> to the truth of his story in the presence of several<lb/> Portuguese Jews of high character.  The <sic>traveller</sic><lb/> narrated&#44; that in the course of his journeys through<lb/> the West Indies and South America he had hired an<lb/> escort&#44; who was a Creole named Francisco Del Castillo.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>On a very stormy day while crossing the<lb/> Cordillera mountains&#44; he over heard some Indians who<lb/> were jaded out&#44; complain of their ill&#45;fate&#44; and<lb/> attribute it to former misdeeds.  His guide tried<lb/> to comfort them by holding out the hope of coming<lb/> rest&#44; but they refused to be comforted saying&#44; that<lb/> they did not deserve pity&#44; since they had pitilessly<lb/> used a righteous people&#44; and that the harsh<lb/> treatment they endured at the hands of the Spaniards&#44;<lb/> was a requital due to their sins.  The <sic>traveller</sic> con&#45;<lb/>&#45;tinued&#44; that the night after this occurrence&#44; he<lb/> took some refreshments out of his satchel and offered<lb/> them to Francisco saying&#58; &#34;Although you also think<lb/> hard of the Spanish people&#44; you are welcome to these<lb/> from me.&#34;  Still But the Creole would not qualify his<lb/> condemnation&#44; still insisting with emphasis that the Spaniards were<lb/> very tyrannical&#44; but and adding with a significant<lb/> look&#58; &#34;Soon a people not cared for will become<lb/> the instruments of God&#39;s vengeance.&#34;  Some Subsequently<lb/> time after to that&#44; Antonio De Montecinos having reached<lb/> Carthagina on the Carribbean sea&#44; was seized by<lb/> the Spanish Inquisition as a secret Jew.<lb/></p>

            <p>He fervently prayed that he might be delivered<lb/> from the thumb&#45;screw and the hot iron thrusts.  and<lb/> Making his morning devotions in the dismal prison cell it wherein he had been kept&#44;<lb/> it happened to him repeatedly to have thanked the<lb/> Lord for not having instinctively recalled the last<lb/> word with a degree of compunction.  What he had<lb/> once overheard had left a deep impression on his mind&#44;<lb/> and he vowed that if he ever came out out alive out from<lb/> his gloomy dungeon&#44; he would go in search of Francisco<lb/> Del Castillo&#44; and ask a full explanation of the<lb/> words which he had could never forgotten.  He was fortunate&#59;<lb/> enough to be the bloody hand of the Inquisition did not strike him.  Being On being set at large&#44; and he immediately<lb/> started in quest of his former escort.  He suc&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceeded at length in his endeavours&#44; and engaged  the Creole<lb/> to take an long extended journey with him in his company.  <sic>travelling</sic> on&#44;<lb/> Montecinos said on one occasion to his guide&#58; &#34;Would<lb/> you believe that I am a Hebrew of the tribe of Levy&#63;  Aye.<lb/>  Yes.  My God is Adona&#239;&#44; and all other gods creeds are<lb/> vanity and falsehood.&#34;  At this Francisco appeared<lb/> astounded&#44; and inquired further into the speaker&#39;s ancestry.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>Having elicited the confession that Israel was<lb/> the acknowledged the father of all the tribes&#44; Francisco<lb/> said&#58; &#34;If you are a man of nerve&#44; and can summon<lb/> enough courage&#44; to follow me&#59; you will learn what<lb/> you wish&#44; but you must travel on foot&#44; submit<lb/> to privations and abide entirely by my directions.&#34;<lb/>  On the Monday after this conversation&#44; Francisco Del<lb/> Castillo asked of Antonio De Montecinos to get ready&#44;<lb/> to put on sandals&#44; lay hold of a staff&#44; and walk on.<lb/>  Far off they went&#44; till the sun of Friday evening&#39;s sun was about to set.  They<lb/> rested to resume their journey on Sunday.  When the morning of Tues&#45;<lb/>&#45;day came&#44; dawned&#44; they looked&#44; and lo&#33; a vast river intercepted their travel.<lb/>  &#34;Halt&#44;&#34; cried out Francisco&#58; &#34;To day you will be shown<lb/> your brethren in faith.&#34;  Making Shaping into a flag out of<lb/> some cloths which they wore round their waist&#44;<lb/> Francisco waved it high.  A column of smoke<lb/> arose from a distance&#44; as a signal of recognition.  Then<lb/> Said Francisco&#58; &#34;The know that we are here.&#34;  Another<lb/> flag  was waved again aloft&#44; and soon a canoe came in sight with three men and<lb/> a woman. advanced in a canoe  The woman stepped<lb/> out and the men remained behind.  After she had spoken aside<lb/> to the Montecinos Francisco&#44; the three men&#44; drew near closer and saluted Montecinos.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>Then One returned to the canoe&#44; and the woman with<lb/> the two men stayed where Francisco was.  The latter<lb/> bowed reverently&#44; but the was addressed by them strangers raised him kindly.<lb/>  Then facing Montecinos each both of the strangers said loudly and distinctly<lb/> in the Hebrew tongue&#58; &#34;Hear O Israel&#44; Adona&#239; is our God&#44; Adona&#239;<lb/> is One&#44;&#34; and they continued&#58; &#34;Our forefathers are Abraham&#44;<lb/> Isaac and Jacob&#44; or Israel&#34;&#44; and making signs with their<lb/> fingers as they counted mentioned the patriarchs.  Again they<lb/> spoke&#58; &#34;We have abundance of land for those who wish<lb/> to live as we do.  Joseph abides in the midst of our<lb/> sea.&#34; and thus they proceeded to speak long mysteriously<lb/> to speak&#44; and making mysterious signs as they spoke.  Montecinos<lb/> felt vexed at not being able to draw from them<lb/> the require a longed for information about their history origin and history&#59; nor to cross over<lb/> to their side&#44; beyond the river.  Attempting to<lb/> jump set foot into the canoe&#44; he was thrust back&#44; and<lb/> might have been drowned&#44; if they had not hastened<lb/> to his rescue.  Our tourist describes the looks<lb/> of the hundreds of the persons who went to and fro&#44; during<lb/> three consecutive days&#44; all evidencing an origin lineage<lb/> totally different form that of the Indians.<lb/></p>

            <p>On the evening of the Tuesday following his<lb/> arrival&#44; after having convinced himself that the<lb/> people he had seen&#44; enjoyed a life of plenty in<lb/> a remote region&#44; Montecinos said to Francisco&#58;<lb/> &#34;Do you remember that those who called them&#45;<lb/>&#45;selves my brethren&#44; promised that I would be fur&#45;<lb/>&#45;ther enlightened by you on what their enigmatic words<lb/> meant&#63;  Let me hear&#44; I pray you&#44; what I am<lb/> eager to learn.&#34;  To which Francisco answered&#58;<lb/> wh &#34;Without your urging me unduly&#44; I will tell the truth&#44;<lb/> as I have it from tradition.  Your brethren&#44; the<lb/> children of Israel&#44; were brought over to this country<lb/> by their God&#44; who wrought great wonders in their<lb/> behalf.  But we Indians that settled here&#44; set arrayed<lb/> ourselves against in opposition to those of your faith&#44; used them<lb/> worse more cruelly than the Spaniards are now treating us.  We<lb/> invaded their distant territories&#44; killed them unmercifully&#44; leaving<lb/> only the women&#44; the aged and children.  But<lb/> finally some of our Indian chiefs bethought<lb/> themselves and arrived at the conclusion that what was<lb/> told them was so&#44; namely&#44; that the God of Israel is<lb/> Allmighty&#45;mighty&#44; that at the fulness of time&#44; His <sic>worshippers</sic><lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p>will gain supremacy&#44; that a universal redemption&#44;<lb/> of all His adorers from dispersion&#44; will take place from hence and<lb/> everywhere.&#34;  Having spoken thus so Francisco pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceeded to say&#58; &#34;My progenitors were Indian chiefs&#44;<lb/> and knew those declarations which they had heard<lb/> from Hebrew Sages.  They tried hard to establish<lb/> themselves in those far off sections of our continent&#44;<lb/> in the expectation of holding free intercourse<lb/> with your brethren&#44; but they did not succeed.<lb/>  At length it was agreed that five among the descend&#45;<lb/>&#45;ants of our chiefs&#44; might come over once every twenty<lb/> moons to greet your brethren where you met them&#59; hold converse with a meeting with the elders of your brethren&#44;<lb/> that only at such distant stated intervals&#45;&#45;except when<lb/> great events called for a special interview&#45;&#45;those<lb/> chiefs should venture out there&#59; and moreover<lb/> that no the person to whom this secret compact is im&#45;<lb/>&#45;parted should be at least three hundred moons old&#59; that<lb/> nothing spoken on these rare occasions should be<lb/> divulged abroad&#44; and that when such meetings take<lb/> place the five chiefs should be come together.  Thus we<lb/> have kept the secret&#44; in the hopes of receiving a reward<lb/> hereafter.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>Now&#44; during my lifetime no special tidings<lb/> had we to report&#44;&#45;&#45;justifying an extraordinary<lb/> meeting interview&#44; save three.  First&#44; the arrival of blood<lb/> thirsty Spaniards&#44; second&#44; the arrivals of huge vessels<lb/> in the South Sea&#44; third&#44; your arrival.  Each<lb/> of these events your brethren have interpreted as<lb/> Providential&#44; towards the <sic>fulfilments</sic> of prophecies.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Montecinos told likewise also his coreligionists in Amsterdam that having returned to<lb/> the place he had started from&#44; Francisco brought<lb/> to him three Indians&#44; men far advanced in years whose<lb/> names he would not reveal&#44; and said&#58; &#34;You can speak<lb/> to them&#59; they are my associates to whom I have alluded<lb/> before.  There is a fifth one besides us&#44; but he is too old&#44;<lb/> he could not walk be present here.&#34;  The three kissed Montecinos&#44;<lb/> and put some questions&#44; to which he replied regarding<lb/> his origin and parentage.  They assured him that no<lb/> fear could be entertained about of the Indians&#44; that they<lb/> were friendly to the Hebrews&#59; that when the ruthless<lb/> Spaniards would be condignly dealt with&#44; the dwellers on<lb/> of the other side of the river would issue from their<lb/> habitations to the deliverance of Israel from out of a<lb/> dire captivity.  For the will of God&#44; whose word<lb/> is infallible&#44; must be come to pass.<lb/></p>

            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen.  Without translating to To spare you the fatigue of listening&#44;<lb/> the latter in order to spare you and myself that of making a literal translation I have brought to your notice the pith of the long narrative<lb/> with which Menasseh Ben Israel prefaces his book.<lb/>  I have brought to your notice its full contents.<lb/>  You will doubtless ridicule it&#44; and so do I&#44; who<lb/> live in the United States of America nearly over full two<lb/> centuries and a half later than the Portuguese Rabbi<lb/> of Amsterdam&#44; and at an age of the world&#44; in<lb/> which science has dispelled the clouds of senseless<lb/> omens and portends and prognostics whilom firmly believed in even<lb/> by the most learned and when the globe has been repeatedly &#91;&#63;&#93; traversed by land and water&#44; but our author was ingenious&#44; he held in perfect<lb/> faith that the ten tribes of Israel&#44; carried by Assyrian<lb/> Kings to Eastern Asia&#44; had providentially been led<lb/> to this newly world discovered continent and Providentially preserved for<lb/> a final reconstruction of the Jewish nationality.<lb/>  I shall not detain you with the arguments advanced<lb/> by the writer of the Esperanza De Isr&#224;el.  He un&#45;<lb/>&#45;questionably brings to his aid a vast erudition derived<lb/> from secular not less than sacred studies&#59; an ingenuity<lb/> really stupendous&#44; directed to the vindication of a number of prophecies&#44;<lb/> which he construes as favoring his theories.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="13"/>
            <p>The book will repay a perusal.<lb/>  What attracted me to it years ago&#44; is a sentiment<lb/> of fraternal deep compassion that I cherish thowards my<lb/> brethren of the Hebrew race&#44; cut off from civilization fraternal association.<lb/>  Not with regard to the ten tribes who do not exist&#44;<lb/> but for others who do exist and are open exposed to baneful<lb/> influences.

I recalled the prophecy<lb/> which&#44; according to the best most accredited authorities&#44; alike both Christ&#45;<lb/>&#45;ians and Jewish&#45;&#45;&#44; names as points to such of our Hebrew brethren.<lb/>  &#34;Behold these shall come from afar&#44; and behold<lb/> those from the North and the West&#44; and those<lb/> from the land of the Sinim&#44;&#34;&#45;&#45;or Chinese.  &#40;Is.

            <p>preservation maintenance of a branch of Abraham&#39;s stock<lb/> torn away from the rest of mankind&#44; and cast adrift&#44; and how<lb/> that circumstance should inspire the faithful<lb/> with confidence in Scriptural predictions.  But<lb/> if in the XVIIth century&#44; the Jesuit Father Ricci had<lb/> found our brethren in Kae Fung Foo already in a state<lb/> of declension&#59; ignorant of the Hebrew language&#59; easily<lb/> deceived by propagandists&#59; the beginning of the<lb/> XVIIIth century showed them still nearer to the<lb/> brink of extinction.  Father Gozani gained obtained some<lb/> information which aroused the interest of Europeans&#44;<lb/> but whatever effort could be made by non&#45;Israelites<lb/> in the face of tremendous difficulties&#44; it was with<lb/> one sole object&#45;&#45;the Christianizing of our unhappy to graft a shoot patriarchal shoot on<lb/> coreligionists. the stem of Christianity.  Only in the first quarter of this<lb/> century&#44; some London Jews dispatched a Hebrew letter to China.<lb/>  Possibly&#44; it was not n received&#45;&#45;notwithstanding assertions to the contrary or more probably on being received<lb/> it remained a sealed book&#59; incomprehensible.<lb/>  Much I had anticipated from the Alliance Isra&#233;lite<lb/> Universelle at Paris.  Her mission is preeminently<lb/> educational&#44; and she proved herself worthy of the trust<lb/> reposed in her government.<lb/></p>

            <p>She exercises it to the elevation of the benighted<lb/> and the illiterate among those who have given in past ages gave<lb/> the world Seers and Sages.  When she the Alliance commis&#45;<lb/>&#45;sioned Joseph Halevi to convey her encouraging<lb/> greetings to the noble stout hearted Falashas in Abys&#45;<lb/>&#45;sinia&#44; anciently converted to our belief&#44; I greatly rejoiced.<lb/>  But more would I have delighted to be assured that<lb/> the scheme to raise from degradation our fellow&#45;religionists<lb/> of the seed of the patriarchs Israel forsaken in the Cesb Chinese<lb/> empire&#44; was consummated.  The proposition has<lb/> remained a vague aspiration.  Meanwhile&#44;<lb/> Mohammedanism and Protestantism will turn to<lb/> their advantage our sad neglect.<lb/></p>

He felt proud of being the first Jew&#44;<lb/> since the famous Benjamin of Tudela of the XIIth<lb/> century&#44; whose travels embraced so vast a<lb/> circuit of the globe.  Ill&#45;natured persons&#44;<lb/> cast dark suspicions on his narratives&#59; charged him<lb/> with having palmed off as facts inventions borrowed<lb/> from imaginary journeys travels&#59; with being so too illiterate to<lb/> write a book in any living language.<lb/></p>

            <p>I cannot tell the original language in which<lb/> our Benjamin II prepared his manuscript.<lb/>  Possibly it was German&#44; for I see his accounts<lb/> honored with the approval of such authorities as<lb/> Alexander Von Humboldt&#44; Carl Ritter&#44; Heinrich<lb/> Peterman and other eminent leading German scholars.  Possibly<lb/> also the diction was corrected and beautified by<lb/> experienced stylists.  I possess printed copies in Hebrew<lb/> and in English&#44; which confessedly did not emanate<lb/> from the author&#44; and I feel morally certain<lb/> that the French redaction was not his writing.<lb/>  At all events&#44; I have no reason to impugn his<lb/> veracity.  &#34;Eight years in Asia and Africa&#34;<lb/> is not a volume of fiction&#44; even if the merit of<lb/> having presented it to the public intelligibly&#44; does<lb/> not belong altogether to the <sic>traveller</sic>.  What I fear is that&#44;<lb/> like many tourists in search of information&#44; Benja&#45;<lb/>&#45;min II&#44; accepted things &#34;second hand&#34; so to say&#44;<lb/> and therefore he was inaccurate in some of his<lb/> statements&#44; lack the stamp of accuracy.<lb/></p>

            <p>Respecting China&#44; I found him provokingly dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;appointing.  Having reached Canton&#44; a climatic<lb/> fever which he contracted terrified him into a speedy<lb/> retreat.  and he contented himself with  In the absence Instead of a scrupulous investigation&#44; he accepted as trustworthy an improbable<lb/> story furnished by an Alsatian claiming Israelite&#44; who claimed to be a<lb/> permanent resident in the Celestial empire.<lb/>  As an illustration of self&#45;contradictions&#44; I may cite<lb/> the circumstance that the same Israelite tells us in<lb/> one breath that how the Chinese Jews he met conversed<lb/> with him in Hebrew&#44; and immediately after that how for<lb/> the last forty years they had no Rabbis and could<lb/> not pray in the holy tongue.  So at least&#44; I read<lb/> in the Hebrew and English edition&#44; but even if in that instance the<lb/> printer is at fault and not the writer&#44; the latter&#39;s<lb/> assertion that in 1855 there lived in Kae Fung Foo<lb/> alone ten thousand Jews is incredible&#44; since in 1866&#44;<lb/> only eleven years later&#44; the colony reckoned but<lb/> seven families&#44; according to the accredited report<lb/> of Professor Martin to the North China Branch<lb/> of the Royal Asiatic Society of England.<lb/></p>

            <p>children of our race&#44; emanated from strangers<lb/> to it.  They sought it to the glorification of<lb/> the Church&#44; or for the advancement of science.  We<lb/> have looked on inactively.

With a polluted tongue<lb/> it told the world that material interest must<lb/> govern human actions&#44; and that to crush the defence&#45;<lb/>&#45;less in order to promote our private ends is pleasing to<lb/> our Lord.
