            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Friends.  My words cannot remove the anguish of the<lb/> separation.  It will be felt&#45;&#45;because for God has so ordained&#45;&#45;<lb/> until time&#44; a messenger of goodness mercy&#44; shall have relieved the<lb/> intensity of grief.  Then the absence of the loved one<lb/> will be partly compensated for by the presence of dear<lb/> objects almost ignored&#44; while suffering the agonies of caused by a sever&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance of this side of the grave.  Not presuming there&#45;<lb/>fore to effect what can never be quickly realized&#44; in a few days&#44;<lb/> I shall keep respect fully silent upon the loss which a<lb/> respected family have sustained.  My sympathies are<lb/> deep&#44; and if the throbbings of human hearts could visibly<lb/> convey the sentiments of brotherly commiseration&#44; many<lb/> would show how sincere are their wishes for the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;solation of all who now mourn.<lb/></p>
            <p>Nature&#44; and the Creator who has made it&#44; will gradually<lb/> allay the poignant sorrow but brought on by a departure.  But the virtues of the dear<lb/> girl&#44; whose spirit flow heavenward so soon&#44; according<lb/> to our imaginary reckonings&#44; ought to receive some at least a passing<lb/> mention.  It may prove an stimulous incentive to those who<lb/> still dwell on earth to follow righteousness. g<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Gentle she was and tender in her feelings&#44;<lb/> thoughtful to prevent offence&#44; unselfish to promote peace<lb/> and goodwill.  When she taught at the Hebrew<lb/> Sunday School&#44; I saw her often&#44; and rejoiced because her<lb/> earnestness and winning manners ways ensured her full success.<lb/>  When she ceased instructing&#44; in order to attend to other household<lb/> duties&#44; the regret of her pupils testified to her worth.<lb/>  I do not believe in the maxim that &#34;the voice of<lb/> the people is the voice of God.&#34;  Frequently are<lb/> communities deceived&#44; but there can be no error of judg&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment&#44; when a retiring young woman&#44; shrinking from<lb/> extending her circle of acquaintances&#44; remaining perfectly<lb/> content with the exercising of her powers in her parental home<lb/> and among a chosen few&#44; is called by all who knew<lb/> her &#34;a lovely girl.&#34;  My praises cannot raise my<lb/> young sister in faith one step higher&#44; in the sphere whence<lb/> she beholds visions sublime and delightsome&#44; but a my slight reference<lb/> to her character may enamour with it be attended with blessings.  Others of her age&#44;<lb/> whom she left behind to do a good work may become enamoured with it&#44; and copy it.  Oh&#33;  May the<lb/> moral traits which beautified the sweet&#45;faced Esther Lyons&#44;<lb/> be copied by mirrored forth in her survivors.  and may May her memory receive<lb/> perpetuity in Philadelphia by deeds reproducing the<lb/></p>

            <p>effects of her kind consideration and genuine affection.<lb/>  Father&#63;  Thou whom the inspired Moses declared a God<lb/> of faithfulness without wrong&#44; just and upright&#44; wouldst<lb/> not have created death as a universal evil.  Nay&#58; Thou<lb/> didst ordain it as a source of happiness unto those whom<lb/> Thou didst endow with an intellectual soul.  Oh&#33; that<lb/> wer regarded the transition in its proper light&#44; for<lb/> then a temporary separation would be borne serenely.<lb/>  We would not measure the length of our staying upon<lb/> earth by our own meteyard.  When the summons for<lb/> the departure come&#44; we would consider that our activity<lb/> has ended here below to recommence in higher realms.<lb/>  But Thou hast so shapen our beings frames&#44; that the chords<lb/> of our hearts are unstrung at the removal of loved ones cherished beings from<lb/> our immediate surroundings.  Thou knowest our weakness<lb/> and mercifully upholdest us that we may not sink into<lb/> despair.  Sustain O Lord&#33; these children of Thy people<lb/> stricken with a sad bereavement.  Bid comfort lodge in their<lb/> midst.  Grant that soon may they all look upwards with<lb/> pious calmness&#44; solaced by the assurance that the dear loved<lb/> one now so lamented is angelically exalted and celestially bea&#45;<lb/>tified.  Amen.<lb/></p>
