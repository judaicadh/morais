                O<lb/>
                P<lb/>
                Y<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Hon. Joseph Blumenthal&#44;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>My dear Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Either I was unfortunate enough not to write clearly&#44;<lb/> or your mind fully occupied with matters of more immediate importance<lb/> failed to understand my meaning.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>It is not the Sunday School&#44; but a wedding&#44; which I<lb/> tried in all possible ways to have postponed&#44; or to let others be engaged<lb/> to perform&#44; which prevents my coming.  The party had sent out invitations<lb/> before they knew of my duty in N. Y. or&#44; at all events&#44; they had decided<lb/> upon the day&#44; and would not listen to having another minister.  All I<lb/> could obtain was to have the marriage at 12 o&#39;clock.  But even then&#44; I<lb/> greatly fear that I shall not arrive at the place of the Convention till<lb/> 4 p.m.&#44; for experience tells me that trains are provokingly slow on<lb/> Sundays.  There is one train at 9 and another at 12.50&#44; and I shall nec&#45;<lb/>essarily take the later.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>I have already sent report.  You may make needful<lb/> corrections or alterations.  If you think that 4 o&#39;clock is too late&#44;<lb/> and it will unduly detain and inconvenience the Convention&#44; I shall not<lb/> come&#59; or I may&#44; if you so choose&#44; send my remarks&#44; and let some one read<lb/> them.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>I would have remitted the money before&#44; but Miss<lb/> Phillips gave me two hundred dollars in notes&#44; and I feared enclosing them<lb/> in a letter.  However&#44; I forward now check for the same&#44; and two checks of<lb/> Mrs. Louis E. Fridenberg&#44; both of which I induced the lady to give to the<lb/> Seminary. &#42; I have a check also from her sister&#44; Mrs. Samuel M. Fridenberg&#44;<lb/> but I have not yet an answer to a letter of mine&#44; asking whether she would<lb/> devote it all to the Seminary&#44; for she intended part of it originally for<lb/> another object.  As soon as I hear from the lady&#44; I will make a remittance.<lb/>  I believe I have already stated that our branch is likely to have its list<lb/> of subscribers and patrons considerably enlarged.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>&#42;She donates the sum of &#36;50 in memory of her mother&#44; the late Mrs. Hannah<lb/> I. Isaacs.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>As to De Sola&#39;s letter&#44; I hold that if Dr. Cohen<lb/> had agreed to publish a reply which I had prepared long ago&#44; the matter<lb/> would have been settled.  I believe I have destroyed it&#44; for which I am<lb/> sorry.  But it is useless to lament the past.  I would suggest&#44; if it<lb/> meets with the views of your colleagues&#44; that you say as follows&#58;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>&#34;Judaism&#44; to deserve that name&#44; must necessarily be &#39;Orthodox&#39;&#44;<lb/> viz. hold &#39;the right opinion&#39;&#34;.  <del>&#91;&#63;&#93;</del><lb/></p>
                
            <p>But the term is not at all original with us&#59; it is borrowed&#44; and unfort&#45;<lb/>unately&#44; it has been mistaken&#44; in some instances&#44; for an adherence to<lb/> bigotry and superstitions.  By &#34;historical Judaism&#34;&#44; we mean the teachings<lb/> of the Bible and of the traditions&#44; as handed down.  The Seminary does not<lb/> and could not act in the character of a <hi rend="underline">Betti Din</hi>.  It is not expected<lb/> that it shall give the Law.  It must teach it&#44; and teach it as received<lb/> from the fathers.  On no account it would tolerate a deviation from it on<lb/> the part of the attendants.  Individuals or corporations of any mode of<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>thinking&#44; willing to aid the institution are not misled by false re&#45;<lb/>presentations.  They are <sic>unequivocably</sic> told that the Seminary means<lb/> to conserve our distinctively national practices.  If such questions<lb/> as those which De Sola directly puts&#44; are asked by the pupils&#44; the<lb/> reply will be a perfect conformity with the history of the Synagogue<lb/> from time immemorial.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>In my judgment&#44; the above general statement covers the<lb/> ground.  Of course&#44; it will not satisfy&#44; but to please the Saint would<lb/> be to destroy the future of a conservatively intelligent Judaism&#44; and<lb/> undo every thing which we have tried to accomplish during the last four<lb/> years.<lb/>  Yours truly&#44;<lb/> S. Morais<lb/></p>
