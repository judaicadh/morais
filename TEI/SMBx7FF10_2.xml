            <p>S. Morais<lb/>
                546 N. Fifth St<lb/></p>
            <p>Philadelphia&#44; July 19 1896<lb/>
                9th of Ab&#45;56<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear Nina&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>My writing this morning is at the same time a painful and<lb/> agreeable duty.  Had I enjoyed fair health&#44; duty would have found me<lb/> in Synagogue&#44; had I been suffering still as I have suffered during the<lb/> whole week past&#44; I could not make the effort of addressing you.  Henry<lb/> has assumed my place.  Esther went for me to the burial ground to give<lb/> the keeper a few dollars.<lb/></p>
            <p>Many called on me yesterday.  I saw none&#44; except Herman.  Now&#44; my<lb/> last sickness brought to mind what I spoke to you about several times<lb/> when you were here.  There has been a period in my life&#44; when my aversion<lb/> to publishing anything of mine&#44; or about myself&#44; determined me to deal<lb/> with my writings as with my body&#44; viz&#44; to have them consumed in two<lb/> layers of quick <sic>line</sic>.  But I reconsidered that thought&#44; for some things<lb/> which I may have translated from Hebrew or Italian&#44; and somethings ori&#45;<lb/>ginal may be of service to modern Jewish literature.  In that case it<lb/> would be selfish to carry out the original idea.  In the large book<lb/> <sic>labelled</sic> &#34;Published writings&#34; in the box named &#34;lectures&#34; there may be<lb/> met what a discreet and unbiased reviewer will reproduce in correct and<lb/> interesting shape.  For instance&#44; the &#34;Prolegomena&#34; just given has been<lb/> favorably received.  As soon as I receive a copy of it I will mark<lb/> corrections which the editor did not rectify&#44; notwithstanding his<lb/> promise.  Sometime ago&#44; I looked over other writings&#44; but you know how<lb/> difficult it is for me to go searching into mistakes&#44; and clearing<lb/> whatever is dirty from a literary standpoint.  Henry&#39;s blind partiality<lb/> might thwart my intention.  Possibly&#44; <del>je wpi&#59;d ;et tje 1<lb/>2ress bring</del> he would let the press bring<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>forth every scrap&#44; which may have pleased at the time&#44; but which might&#44;<lb/> perhaps&#44; read as valueless in after years.  Yourself and Emanuel would<lb/> exercise due discretion&#44; and regarding the Hebrew&#44; you may find some<lb/> impartial critic.<lb/></p>
            <p>Lectures&#44; unless of a national or literary tendency&#44; may as well<lb/> be consigned to oblivion.  My predecessor has left many volumes of<lb/> sermons.  Who reads them&#63;  My contemporaries&#44; send broadcast their<lb/> weekly discourses.  They will be shortlived.  Let therefore deep con&#45;<lb/>sideration guide the printing of anything of mine.<lb/></p>
            <p>If I succeed in having Jeremiah translated it will appear in the<lb/> next Bible and you may say that the translation was mine.  I could not<lb/> attend the last meeting of the translators on Thursday&#44; but it is a<lb/> question in my mind whether I would submit to have my rendition over&#45;<lb/>hauled by the text revisors.  Time will show.<lb/></p>
            <p>My principal anxiety now is how to be rejuvenated enough for<lb/> the fall work.  Let us hope on<lb/> Good bye keep well<lb/> much love from<lb/> S. M.<lb/></p>
