            <p>My dear Sir&#33;  The postal card&#44; which you were kind enough<lb/> to send me the other day&#44; has caused me more pleasure&#44;<lb/> than you are perhaps aware of&#44; for it has been a<lb/> token of your great kindness and the interest&#44; you<lb/> take in my endeavor to collect the &#34;Songs of Israel.&#34;¬ù<lb/>  Would that all the Rabbis of our country might<lb/> feel the same pious regard for the preservation<lb/> of the sacred times of our ancestors&#44; there&#44; and<lb/> only then could we hope&#44; that our musical service<lb/> would rid itself from much&#44; that is unjewish<lb/> and foreign to its character.  I do not belong to<lb/> that class of Israelites&#44; who would rigidly<lb/> exclude from the Synagogue <hi rend="underline">all</hi> kinds of modern<lb/> music&#44; for the simple reason&#44; that not all our<lb/> so called Jewish Melodies are worth preserving&#44;<lb/> but I am entirely opposed to the cultivation<lb/> of such pieces&#44; whose texts are so ultimately<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>interwoven with popular texts <del>that</del> of the<lb/> Christian denominations&#44; that you cannot<lb/> well <sic>seperate</sic> one from the other.  Take for<lb/> example the beautiful and truly edifying<lb/> Church Melody&#44; known as &#34;old Hundred.&#34;¬ù<lb/></p>
            <p>Musically there can be not the least objection<lb/> to introduce the tune into our Temples.<lb/>  <sic>but</sic>&#44; whenever you hear its popular strains&#44;<lb/> it suggests to the mind the text&#44; which is a<lb/> glorification of the Trinity&#44; hence&#8212;not even<lb/> the Melody is recommendable in our Synagogues.<lb/></p>
            <p>Take another composition&#44; which enjoys a<lb/> worldwide reputation for grandeur of conception&#44;<lb/> the &#34;Kyrie&#34;¬ù of Mozart&#39;s 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> mass.  You hear that<lb/> very often in Jewish places of worship&#44; of course<lb/> with a mild and water text&#44; that is&#44; with words&#44;<lb/> which suit everybody and&#8212;nobody.<lb/></p>
            <p>Grant as this class of melodies be&#44;<lb/> we need not adopt them for our religious&#44; musical<lb/> service&#44; since a <sic>concientious</sic> compiler could<lb/> find among the stores of ancient traditional<lb/> musical a great many&#44; which&#44; adapted to modern<lb/> English texts&#44; would give the Jewish Worship its own<lb/> characteristic&#44; which it once possessed.<lb/></p>

            <p>I have always wondered&#44; why none of the compilers<lb/> of &#34;S&#91;&#63;&#93;oth Israel&#34;¬ù from Sulzer down to the<lb/> latest&#44; have never introduced the <sic>Sefardic</sic><lb/> ancient tunes.  I know but very few of them&#44; but<lb/> the little I do know&#44; is so much better&#44; than the<lb/> Polish Chasoneth of the old German Synagogue&#44;<lb/> that I am sometimes apt to compare their<lb/> unknown composer with a Spanish Grander<lb/> and a &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; &#34;Pollak.&#34;¬ù  The &#34;Ashkenath&#34;¬ù Liturgy could<lb/> very well afford to adopt some of them&#44; even<lb/> if the original <sic>sefardic</sic> texts do not suit the<lb/> texts of our&#8212;alas&#8212;too many new<lb/> Prayer and Hymn Books.<lb/></p>
            <p>I do not remember&#44; whether I informed you in<lb/> my first letter&#44; that I had received from Paris the score of<lb/> 30 &#91;crossed&#45;out&#93; <sic>hebrew</sic> compositions by your countryman Salomo<lb/> di Rossi&#44; a celebrated composer of the latter part of the<lb/> 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.  These long lost hebrew pieces were<lb/> found 2 or 8 years ago by Cavaliere Marco Mortara of<lb/></p>

            <p>They are of great beauty&#44; but I doubt&#44; whether<lb/> they will ever become popular among modern<lb/> Israelites&#44; on account of their often quaint<lb/> <sic>mediaeval</sic> harmony&#44; which is like that of<lb/> Rossi&#39;s contemporary Palestine&#8212;and also<lb/> on a&#47;c of their being written in the style of the<lb/> 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century for 4&#44; 5.6.7.8 voices&#44; <del>our</del> which<lb/> would make their execution <sic>immensly</sic> difficult&#44;<lb/> unless somebody would arrange them for<lb/> quartette<sic></sic>&#44; an undertaking&#44; involving great<lb/> cost <del>and</del> with a very indifferent public to buy<lb/> them.  I beg your pardon for intruding into your valuable<lb/> time&#44; but your kind remembrance of my object in view<lb/> has encouraged me to say a few words about our<lb/> Jewish Music as it is&#44; and as it ought to be.  I have<lb/> very little hope &#40;speranza&#41; that the near future will<lb/> bring improvements&#59; for as long as we have indifferent<lb/> Rabbis and uneducated Chasonim&#44; we may very<lb/> properly&#34;&#34;and certainly not sacrilegiously&#8212;apply the<lb/> words of your great countryman to the musical worship of<lb/> modern Israel&#61; Lasciate ogni speranza<lb/> Voi di&#39; entrate.<lb/>  My sincerest regards to you and thanks for your interest&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours truly<lb/>
