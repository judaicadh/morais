            <p>For a funeral.<lb/></p>
            <p>My province is not to draw forth sighs and tears&#44; but to offer afford con&#45;<lb/>&#45;solation and breathe in sweet inspiriting hope.  Those are occasions on which<lb/> the performance of this official duty becomes almost an impossibility.<lb/>  When standing beside the coffin of a creature&#44; just budding into<lb/> manhood&#44; and to whom many hearts turned with fond with glowing antici&#45;<lb/>&#45;pations&#44; then the lips refuse their accustomed office.  Then<lb/> is indeed the effort to lighten the burden of sorrow difficult<lb/> in the extreme.  Not so to&#45;day&#44; my dear friends&#33;<lb/>  It would be irreverent in those on the part of men who are taught to see in the<lb/> laws of nature&#44; the laws of a Creating God&#44; to utter wailings<lb/> and to weep because the same eternal laws have not been in&#45;<lb/>&#45;verted for our special benefit.  The usual tenure of life is<lb/> three score years and ten.  Through the favor of the Most<lb/> High&#44; our deceased coreligionist exceeded that term.  He<lb/> trod the earth with a firm step&#44; at an age whereat others<lb/> bend low towards the grave.  But even this consideration<lb/> would be insufficient to allay grief&#59; for&#44; we may live long<lb/> but suffer long.  We may drag lend an existence exposed to ceaseless trials&#44; severely beaten<lb/> by contrary all the winds of adversity&#44; but if after having travelled journeyed far in<lb/> safety&#59; after having kept health and faculties&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>having enjoyed the delights sweets of home&#44; and the pleasure delight of<lb/> social intercourse&#44; we compose ourselves for the everlasting<lb/> rest&#44; with scarcely a physical pain and a struggle&#44; then&#44;<lb/> I think&#44; that the survivors instead of lamenting should<lb/> raise their eyes heavenward beaming with thanks to the God from whom all<lb/> good proceeds.  Such should be your feelings&#44; sons<lb/> and daughters of Jacob Cauffman.  For&#44; your father re&#45;<lb/>&#45;mained with you to a more protracted lengthier period than what<lb/> is allotted to mortals&#44; and consider ponder on thus&#45;&#45;he continued in the possession of<lb/> a frame unimpaired by age&#59; in a state of bodily vigor<lb/> which made work a pleasure and added zest to his friendly interchange of thoughts.<lb/>  Your filial attachment&#44; your standing in the community&#44;<lb/> your temporal success proved a source of exhaustless grati&#45;<lb/>&#45;fication to that father in Israel&#44; and only a few days before his departure&#44; he was<lb/> permitted to reach the climax of terrestrial blessings.  For&#44;<lb/> what joy can compare with that of having been spared<lb/> to witness the happiness of even our children&#39;s children&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>Why should you then lament&#63;  Tears must naturally flow<lb/> at the absence from our midst of a parent devoted to his<lb/> family and respected for his kind and genial disposition&#44;<lb/> but after the anguish&#44; always attending the hour&#44; in which<lb/> we consign our loved ones to the cold earth&#44; shall have passed abated&#44;<lb/> away you&#44; doubtless&#44; will calmly reflect&#44; and be comforted.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>And she also who is more sorely bereaved by this event<lb/> than any among the mourners survivors&#44; she also will receive conso&#45;<lb/>&#45;lation by recalling God&#39;s favors on the feast&#44; and looking to contemplating her present<lb/> surroundings.  For&#44; you will&#44; I am certain&#44; speak to her<lb/> of the divine boons bestowed upon her husband while living&#44;<lb/> and you will also so effectually smooth her path&#44; that she will not<lb/> meet the slightest impediment in journeying through it&#44; tho&#39;<lb/> deprived of the arm on which she was wont to lean for support.<lb/>  You will cause your mother to feel that in her has been<lb/> verified the sentence of the good book.  &#34;Old age is a crown<lb/> of glory&#59;&#34; for&#44; you will make it sparkle with unfading<lb/> lustre&#44; by an attention and a filial consideration that have no limit.<lb/>  But a mourner insensible&#44; yet while in the act of chasing away sorrow&#44; my mind beholds an object inconsolably standing now<lb/> beside this coffin.  It bends low silently glides over and bewails the loss sust&#45;<lb/>&#45;tained.  Shall I name that mourner&#63;  It is the sanctuary<lb/> where Jacob Cauffman <sic>worshipped</sic>&#44; and towards the sup&#45;<lb/>&#45;plying of whose wants he willingly contributed.  It con&#45;<lb/>&#45;templates the void and greatly deprecates it the void created&#44; because the empty<lb/> space grows continually wider&#44; and those who should fill it close<lb/> up the void the gap&#44; keep aloof.  Alas&#33; the ranks are fast thinning<lb/> away&#59; when from shall the fresh recruits come&#63;.....<lb/> Pardon the my Brethren&#33; words which come out unbidden.  This is not<lb/> the occasion&#44; on which even faintly to allude to questions<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>of a congregational character&#44; but as a servant who<lb/> dearly loves his master&#44; will instinctively bear his name<lb/> on his lips in time and out of time&#44; so do I&#44; inopportunely<lb/> perhaps&#44; feel impelled to present to view an object very<lb/> near to my heart.  Oh&#33; may the children not forsake cast off<lb/> what their fathers reverenced&#59; may they rise as sustaining<lb/> pillars to religious institutions&#44; tending to preserve perpetuate the<lb/> principles inculcated by the sainted and the righteous.<lb/>  And they who are imparadised in the contemplation of God&#44;<lb/> will smile upon such deed with celestial approval.<lb/></p>
