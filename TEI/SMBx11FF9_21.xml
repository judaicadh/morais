            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>
                PHILADELPHIA&#44; PA.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>I am the most unfit person to stand here in the<lb/> capacity of a eulogist.  Not because I disagree<lb/> with the Sages of Israel&#44; who hold that in the same<lb/> manner as ill&#45;will looks at the doings of another with<lb/> jaundiced eyes&#44; so is love apt to be completely blind<lb/> to a friend&#39;s shortcomings.  No&#44; not for that reason<lb/> am I disqualified to speak of the dear dead at this<lb/> sad hour of parting&#44; but for a motive&#44; which I call<lb/> selfish.  I keenly feel&#44; that myself and my<lb/> children have lost in the demise of A. H. a very dear<lb/> friend&#44; long tried as such&#44; and of a long standing.<lb/>  Only four years are lacking to complete half a century&#44;<lb/> since I made the acquaintance of that sincere Jew&#45;<lb/>&#45;ess.  Her tokens of touching consideration&#44; of<lb/> gentle goodness and loving kindness towards me&#44; have<lb/> been more numerous than I could count.  To<lb/> my household&#44; she showed&#44; for my sake&#44; evidences of<lb/> affection with great frequency.  I therefore mourn<lb/> with those who are given by the ordinance of nature<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>and of nature&#39;s God the deepest cause for wail&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing and lamenting.  What a mother they<lb/> have lost&#44; I&#44; better than very many&#44; could intel&#45;<lb/>&#45;ligently describe.  Her heart free from the<lb/> least spark of egotism&#44; was all aglow with a<lb/> burning wish to promote her sons&#39; happiness.<lb/>  For that she yearned&#44; for that she made sacrifices&#59;<lb/> for the success of every one to whom she had given<lb/> birth&#44; she ardently besought the Center.<lb/></p>
            <p>But if I am incapacitated from pronouncing a pa&#45;<lb/>&#45;negyric&#44; because my feelings are too much wrought<lb/> up by the loss sustained&#44; I would sin of culpable ne&#45;<lb/>&#45;glect&#44; as a servant of religion&#44; if I did not allude by<lb/> a single word to her benevolence&#44; exercised at one time<lb/> of her life in connection with an asylum of orphans&#59;<lb/> at other times in concert with women of her faith&#44; conduct&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing a charitable organization&#44; if I mentioned nothing<lb/> of her personal generosity to the necessitous without<lb/> distinction of creed or colour&#44; of her attachment to the<lb/> Dwelling of holiness&#44; which she delighted to visit&#44;<lb/> and to uphold&#44; as far as it lay in her power&#59; if I<lb/> did not allow even a passing reference to her broad<lb/></p>

            <p>views&#44; exhibited in her endeavours previous to the<lb/> memorable Centennial of 1876&#44; and to her national sen&#45;<lb/>&#45;timents never flagging in their zeal..............<lb/> But no&#58; thou friend of my youth&#44; ever kind to<lb/> me and mine&#44; thou standest not in need of my<lb/> poor language&#44; as a tribute of personal regard.<lb/>  Not to praise&#44; but to pray now for the joys&#44; is<lb/> my incentive&#59; for joys everlasting&#44; unalloyed&#44; which<lb/> the recollection of good deeds performed&#44; creates in<lb/> that existence which thou hast just entered.  There<lb/> trials dare not intrude.  Only what was supremely<lb/> pleasurable here below&#44; appears before the mind&#44; to<lb/> enhance the delights of Eden.  Oh&#33; mayest thou<lb/> become imparadised in the contemplation of thy<lb/> Maker&#44; in whose presence glories abide&#44; in whose right<lb/> hand immortality has no station.  May thy name and<lb/> thy actions remain embalmed in the memory of thy<lb/> sons and of all who appreciated thy sweet companion&#45;<lb/>&#45;ship whilst thou wast permitted long to tread the<lb/> earth.  May thy entrance in paradise be welcome by all the<lb/> good and true who have preceded thee there&#44; in the language of our<lb/> prophet.  Let her come in peace&#44; resting in her spiritual couch&#44; as ever<lb/> one who has done what is righteous in the sight of God.&#34;  Amen.<lb/></p>
