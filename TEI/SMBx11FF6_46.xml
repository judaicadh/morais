                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Never will I agree to the opinion of some&#44; whose superior<lb/> learning and saintly life I consider worthy of all<lb/> respect&#44; never will I agree that the purpose<lb/> of the obsequies performed at funerals&#44; is to bestow<lb/> praises and to draw tears.  No&#58; my heart tells me<lb/> that to be sparing of in eulogies&#44; and profuse in consolations&#44;<lb/> is the solemn duty of God&#39;s servants&#44; when mourners are<lb/> bent with anguish.  If words of laudation could influence<lb/> the judgment of the Most High&#44; so that the happiness<lb/> of the departed might increase above in proportion to<lb/> the encomiums given here below&#44; or if the loud weeping of<lb/> the bereaved&#44; could chase away distress&#44; I would always<lb/> search out with exceeding diligence some traits in the charac&#45;<lb/>&#45;ter of the deceased enabling me to dwell on their merits.<lb/>  I would always lay great stress upon the loss sustained<lb/> by Hebrew families&#44; in order that the latter might sigh<lb/> and sob and utter lamentations.  But every instinct<lb/> of my nature tells me that when my brother is in<lb/> affliction&#59; when my sister in faith is deeply pained&#44;<lb/> I must call to my aid what can in reality relieve sorrow.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>In the present instance&#44; the grief may be lessened<lb/> by the consideration that death brought a cessation of physical<lb/> and mental suffering&#44; yet the bereft turn to me for comfort.<lb/>  To receive it at my hands&#44; they asked that I&#45;&#45;a comparative<lb/> stranger&#45;&#45;would officiate on this melancholy occasion.<lb/>  My sympathies are with a widowed mother on whom will<lb/> henceforth devolve an obligation&#44; ever difficult but doubly<lb/> so&#44; when an efficient support is wanting&#45;&#45;the support<lb/> which a husband must lead his wife in the training of<lb/> her children.  To that mother I am commissioned by re&#45;<lb/>&#45;ligion to say&#58; Rise above dejection&#44; centre your energies<lb/> upon the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of a holy task.  Draw your dear ones<lb/> closer to your hearts by stirring up a sense of gratitude.<lb/>  Let them feel that their future is your study&#44; the<lb/> elevation of their characters your highest ambition&#44;<lb/> and every improvement of that son&#44; ever advancement<lb/> of that daughter child will be to you a cup of the sweetest<lb/> consolation.  You will remember the dead only to connect<lb/> with his name that of his offspring&#44; whom you will<lb/> have rendered worthy of a high extraction&#44; and of whom<lb/> you may become proud by reason of their social standing&#59;<lb/> because of the reverential tenderness they show to her that gave<lb/> them birth.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Yes&#44; believe one&#44; who may venture to assert that<lb/> he speaks from experience&#59; believe me&#44; when I say that a<lb/> healing to our wounds is a faithful discharge of duties&#44; in what<lb/>&#45;ever condition Providence may have seen fit to place us.<lb/>  It would be unnatural to forget the comparison of our youth&#44;<lb/> but what nobler tribute can mortals pay to the memory<lb/> of those beatified in immortality than to complete the good work<lb/> left unfinished by the departed.  May the relict of S. B. Weil<lb/> obtain from her Creator the strength she needs to carry<lb/> out her natural wishes&#44; and may she behold her endea&#45;<lb/>&#45;vours crowned with a success that brings lasting consolation.<lb/>  The children are young&#44; still they can realize the loss<lb/> they have sustained.  To them a word may not be inap&#45;<lb/>&#45;propriately addressed.  God has sent you as<lb/> hovering angels round your family hearths.  Your<lb/> conduct can best enkindle joy&#44; and <sic>dispell</sic> gloom.<lb/>  Every act of obedience towards your mother will<lb/> be a blessing to her&#44; your progress in school and<lb/> in society will be her delight.  Far be from me<lb/> the thought of intensifying pain&#44; but I would do<lb/> your father wrong&#44; and your mother injustice&#44;<lb/> if I did not avail myself of this event&#44; apt to create<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>the deepest impression&#44; to ask that you will<lb/> honor the dead by an abiding affection and solicitude<lb/> for the living.  May you grow to shed lustre on your<lb/> family and on your people and on the community of<lb/> Philadelphia.  But a being deserving of<lb/> our fraternal commiseration in the highest degree&#44; is the<lb/> hoary headed father&#44; compelled by an inscrutable decree<lb/> to consign these remains to the cold earth.  If David<lb/> King of Israel&#44; mourned and wept and refused to be con&#45;<lb/>&#45;soled because his son&#45;&#45;though wicked and rebellious&#45;&#45;had<lb/> gone before him to the grave&#44; what he must he feel&#44; who&#44;<lb/>&#45;&#45;as I am assured&#45;&#45;received continual tokens of filial devotion<lb/> from the departed.  My aged fellow believer&#44; too greatly<lb/> tried already by bodily suffering&#44; I must commend to the kind<lb/> and considerate thought of the survivors.  Oh let not the years<lb/> which will fast glide away&#44; fasten upon him a crushing<lb/> weight of sorrow&#44; but let his latter days pass by with&#45;<lb/>&#45;out <sic>inflincting</sic> additional anguish&#44; let the transition<lb/> from the mortal to the immortal be made easy and peace&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful through the care of children and relatives.  And<lb/> for the departed let us pray &#40;Here a prayer followed&#41;.<lb/></p>
