            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>My sympathies are stirred up.  I feel deeply for<lb/> a family almost on a sudden&#44; with scarcely an<lb/> intimation&#44; plunged into the depth of a great sorrow.<lb/>  For&#44; on the morning of the first day of this week&#44;<lb/> when David Potsdamer showed signs of a loss of<lb/> his usual energy&#44; by remaining in not rising from his bed&#44; the thought<lb/> was far&#44; very far from his near and dear ones that on the<lb/> fourth day he would lie a a lifeless corpse.  His&#45;now<lb/> inconsolable wife&#45;&#45;so often tried by bodily ailments&#45;&#45;&#44;<lb/> after a nine weeks&#39; sickness had just been pronounced<lb/> convalescent&#44; and for the first time had taken a walk short ride<lb/> of two squares to visit a relative.  She hoped<lb/> she would return home somewhat invigorated &#38; refreshed.  The shock she ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;perienced when told that her husband&#44; whom she had<lb/> left ill but not&#44; to all appearances&#44; near his end&#44; in<lb/> the forenoon&#44; had passed away from earth soon in the<lb/> afternoon&#44; may be imagined&#44; but not described.<lb/>  To the intensity of that grief&#44; was added the anxiety<lb/> about two of her daughters&#44; who had very recently suf&#45;<lb/>&#45;fered acutely with diseases&#44; and whom the news demise<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>of their father&#39;s death might affect very<lb/> seriously.  When we consider the weight of<lb/> such affliction&#44; words will not come to our assistance&#44;<lb/> so that we may afford the distressed some relief.<lb/>  I can only give the bereaved expressions of condolence&#44;<lb/> even more than that&#59; the assurance of brotherly com&#45;<lb/>&#45;passion.  Yet&#44; the profound pity I feel for<lb/> the widow and her daughters is not unaccompanied<lb/> with by comforting thoughts.  The principal and<lb/> the highest&#44; is my knowledge of their characters.<lb/>  For&#44; affectionate they are&#44; united the sentiments and<lb/> actions&#44; and self&#45;denying for the sake of each other.<lb/>  Were it not that my utterances might sound<lb/> like flattery&#44; I would tell how the filial<lb/> devotion&#44; the intelligent ministration of one of<lb/> one&#44; proved a heavenly blessing&#44; in weal and woe.<lb/>  I would relate how the industry of all&#44; has become<lb/> the anchor of salvation to the entire household.<lb/>  But I may say&#44; without the least impropriety&#44;<lb/> that a great source of comfort to me&#44; and it surely<lb/> must be to the bereaved&#44; is the sterling principles<lb/> of rectitude which all of them have inherited.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>For&#44; as the deceased was upright in times of<lb/> privations&#44; as in the days of case&#44; so are his<lb/> children&#59; and they possess moreover besides perse&#45;<lb/>&#45;verance and capacity to earn a livelihood&#44; not in<lb/> luxury&#44; but what is infinitely better&#44; in honesty<lb/> and contentment.  Yes&#44; dear friends.  The<lb/> Almighty who has chastened you so severely for<lb/> reasons beyond human understanding&#44; has not deprived<lb/> you of a staff of support&#44; when He called hence from<lb/> our midst David Potsdamer.  He has held out to<lb/> you the means of rising above this great trouble&#44;<lb/> by giving us your two associates&#44; mutual love<lb/> and fondness for work.  And I would have<lb/> wasted your time on an occasion so melancholy&#44; and<lb/> have spoken only to b hear myself own voice&#44; if I did not<lb/> <sic>not</sic> improve the opportunity.  I ask you then<lb/> in the name of our holy religion to keep stead&#45;<lb/>&#45;fast to the virtues you have displayed heretofore.<lb/>  I urge you to labor together to reach the same<lb/> end&#45;&#45;your reciprocal welfare&#59; to cling to your mother&#44;<lb/> who does need your attention&#59; your consolation&#44; and<lb/> to let the fear of God dwell with you&#44; and keep away<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>from your home the seductions temptations which might<lb/> work degeneracy.  For her who gave you birth&#44;<lb/> I have fellow&#45;feelings&#44; knowing the void created in<lb/> her heart&#59; for a relative called by a sad ordination&#44;<lb/> to mourn in one week over a brother and a brother<lb/> in law&#44; I have commiseration&#59; But for the deceased&#44; for your four sisters&#44;<lb/> I have sincere wishes of a happier future&#44; but for<lb/> the deceased I have ardent prayers.  For&#44; notwith&#45;<lb/>&#45;standing many good qualities of a domestic and<lb/> social nature&#44; his ideas frequently went astray&#44;<lb/> and his conduct was not always undeviatingly consistent with<lb/> the cl teachings of Moses and the <sic>Sags</sic>.  Because<lb/> of the errors of the intellect&#44; and of those prompted by<lb/> the weakness of the flesh&#44; I beseech in his behalf<lb/> the forgiveness of our merciful Lord.  Oh may our<lb/> Divine Judge cause the vicissitudes which David Pots&#45;<lb/>&#45;damer underwent to come up before His tribunal&#44; and in<lb/> consideration of their severity&#44; may the sentence pronounced<lb/> be pardon and grace&#44; a seat among the holy<lb/> and saints&#44; who rejoice in the contemplation of God.<lb/>  &#40;Here followed a longer prayer.&#41;<lb/></p>
