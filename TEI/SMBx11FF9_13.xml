            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Great is the power of faith.  It alone can remove<lb/> mountains of sorrow.  For that quality of the<lb/> heart I eagerly wish&#44; that I may impart it<lb/> to others and become a source of relief and conso&#45;<lb/>&#45;lation.  The cold reasoning of the mind may hard&#45;<lb/>&#45;en us into indifference&#44; make us callous&#44; but<lb/> will not soften our woes&#44; and bring calmness&#44;<lb/> the serenity of fortitude.  To say to the bereaved&#58;<lb/> wipe your tears&#44; which profit you nothing&#59; cease<lb/> to lament&#44; for you ought to know that diseases<lb/> may overtake us at any stage of our existence&#44; and<lb/> to die early or late is but a natural process&#59;<lb/> To say so&#44; may be conformable to the teachings of a<lb/> dry philosophy&#44; but they who mourn over the<lb/> loss of beloved objects need other appliances&#44; their<lb/> passionless ratiocination.  Faith is the most<lb/> effective balm to sooth us in affliction.<lb/>  I have read of an olden Sage who was un&#45;<lb/>&#45;fortunate through life&#44; and yet his trust in a wise<lb/> Providence sustained him to a far advanced age.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Rabbi Johanan son of Nappacha was left an<lb/> orphan in his childhood.  When he grew to<lb/> manhood and married&#44; he was doomed to bury<lb/> all his offspring&#44; but neither sorrows robbed him<lb/> of his confiding trust in Providence.  His having<lb/> remained without parents&#44; was a strong incentive<lb/> to his rising in the world by dint of study&#59;<lb/> his having been bereft of his progeny became<lb/> the means of his affording his fellow creatures<lb/> comfort.  It is related that when calling on<lb/> the sorrow&#45;stricken&#44; he would show them a<lb/> bone of his last child he had interred&#44; and<lb/> urge them not to murmur&#44; for very severe<lb/> were the visitations under which he himself had<lb/> suffered&#44; and nevertheless he had arisen above<lb/> dejection and labored on for good.  In his<lb/> profound sympathy&#44; he would tell the<lb/> unfortunate &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;  Though a sharp sword<lb/> were suspended over a man&#39;s head&#44; he ought not<lb/> to despair&#44; for Job&#44; who endured all sorts of tribulations&#44;<lb/> exclaimed &#34;even if He slays me&#44; in Him will I hope&#34;.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Such are the words which my hearts dictates<lb/> at this sad moment&#44; and with which I am<lb/> prompted to address you mother&#44; grandmother<lb/> and loving relatives of this dear child.  I feel<lb/> pained at your loss&#44; but it would ill become<lb/> me to add to your grief by utterances of mur&#45;<lb/>&#45;mur and complaint.  Your....has been sum&#45;<lb/>&#45;moned hence too soon and all your ministration<lb/> of kindness could not hold her back.  She has<lb/> returned pure to her Maker.  How many fa&#45;<lb/>&#45;thers and mothers would rejoice to know that their<lb/> children were returned to God spotless&#44; unstained<lb/> by irreligion and vice.  See&#44; I beg of you&#44;<lb/> see to the moral training of your J...  He may<lb/> prove a spring of exhaustless joy&#44; if you will hence&#45;<lb/>&#45;forth centre upon him your undivided attention&#44;<lb/> offering him healthful counsel&#44; profitable in&#45;<lb/>&#45;struction&#44; and an example at home and abroad<lb/> unexceptionable.  And may He who wounds<lb/> but heals&#44; afflicts but consoles give you the power<lb/> which faith imparts&#44; that you may soon arise<lb/> above this sad bereavement.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>O Sovereign Lord&#33;  It was Thy unsearchable<lb/> will to deprive this Hebrew family of an object<lb/> that brightened their existence.  The removal of this<lb/> loveable creature has cast a gloom round their path<lb/> Oh deign to dispell darkness and according to Thy<lb/> mercy bring light and gladness.  Fulfill in them<lb/> the sentence of Thy prophet &#34;I will turn their mourn&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing into joy and comfort them.&#34;  Amen<lb/></p>
