            <p>Dear Mr Morais<lb/></p>
                
            <p>From the above address<lb/> you will note that 11 Bevis Marks<lb/> is a direction of the past&#44; as I<lb/> was obliged a few months&#44; after<lb/> the demises of my lamented<lb/> Husband&#44; to vacate the official<lb/> residence&#44; in favor of his successor&#44;<lb/> and sought a residence &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> near our Branch Synagogue.<lb/>  Your ni&#91;&#63;&#93; heart will readily<lb/> believe I did not leave the<lb/> house of my married life&#44; with<lb/> all tis associations&#44; without<lb/> a severe pang and the dear<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93; Syangogue&#44; in which for<lb/> so many years&#44; I had prayed&#44; prayed<lb/></p>

            <p>with so many loved ones&#44; but<lb/> such are the sad changes&#44; that<lb/> we must all submit to&#44; I am<lb/> here surrounded by all my old<lb/> Friends who kindly endeavor<lb/> to win me from myself&#8212;but altho<lb/> 2 years and four months have<lb/> elapsed since my loss the wound<lb/> is not healed but I endeavor to<lb/> follow in his footsteps by as far<lb/> as is my power to do my duty and<lb/> have resumed my attendance<lb/> at our schools&#44; to which as of<lb/> old I am much attached.  We<lb/> hold a distribution of pr&#91;&#63;&#93; on<lb/> the 13th June&#44; being the first since<lb/> the demise of our much lamented<lb/> Haham a memorial ode has<lb/> been written for the occasion by<lb/> our talented coreligionist Mr Henry<lb/> for the occasion&#44; and as I think you<lb/> still feel an interest in the old<lb/></p>

            <p>congregation&#44; enclose you a copy<lb/> I have written thus much without<lb/> referring to the cause which has<lb/> drawn this forth&#44; but be assured<lb/> I do not the less value your very<lb/> kind thought&#44; and fully appreciate<lb/> the very pleasing remembrance<lb/> you must entertain towards<lb/> your first English riends by<lb/> making me the recipient of one<lb/> of your son&#39;s early production<lb/> the compilation of which&#44; reflects<lb/> much credit&#44; on the writer&#44; of<lb/> the various Biographies of Our<lb/> eminent men and women.  I<lb/> have already perused the greater<lb/> part of the work altho for the<lb/> reason above named I only<lb/> received the book on the 26th Inst<lb/> assure your son of the deep<lb/> interest I feel for his future<lb/> success as a Jewish writer but<lb/> added to that also <sic>also</sic> I must add<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>that as your son my interest is<lb/> greater most sincerely do I wish<lb/> him&#44; and your other children<lb/> every success in life and may<lb/> you dear sir be spared to witness<lb/> the fulfillment of your hearts<lb/> desire towards them the fine<lb/> blessing denied me my &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> Husband would have echoed<lb/> my sentiments.  Should any of<lb/> your children ever visit the old<lb/> country whilst I am living I am<lb/> now an old &#40;woman&#41; I hope<lb/> they would not fail to seek me.<lb/>  I need not assure you&#44; that<lb/> my news&#44; your old pupils&#44; have<lb/> felt pleasure in perusing your<lb/> son&#39;s work and beg me to assure<lb/> you of their respectful regard<lb/> and good wishes.  All in life<lb/> passes as in a dream.<lb/></p>
            <p>With <sic>reteriated</sic> thanks&#44; and good<lb/> wishes I remain with sentiments<lb/> of esteem&#8212;Yours truly<lb/></p>

                As on that day when fast the tidings spread<lb/>
                With saddened hearts we mourn&#8212;our Chief is dead.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Life&#39;s cares and pleasures lay aside awhile&#44;<lb/>
                And think of him whose name we all revere&#59;<lb/>
                A thousand hopes and fears the hours beguile&#44;<lb/>
                And leave us scarce the time to drop a tear&#44;<lb/>
                But on this spot where once he loved to tread&#44;<lb/>
                Oh let us pause and think&#8212;our Chief is dead.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Dead&#33; in his zenith of his life and fame&#44;<lb/>
                Before one power was turning to decay&#44;<lb/>
                Veiled&#44; unexpected the Destroyer came&#44;<lb/>
                And only left for earth the lifeless clay&#59;<lb/>
                But from our hearts his image ne&#39;er has fled&#44;<lb/>
                It lives&#8212;then wherefore do we say he&#39;s dead&#63;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Our Chief doth live&#8212;his virtues shall not die&#44;<lb/>
                His teachings and his influence still are felt&#44;<lb/>
                Here&#8212;where he drew our every thought on high&#44;<lb/>
                Now&#8212;while our hearts with sweet remembrance melt&#44;<lb/>
                The Gates of Hope their consolation give&#44;<lb/>
                Here he could never die&#8212;our Chief doth live.<lb/></p>
