            <p>S. Almosnino Esqre<lb/>
                Phila July 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1868<lb/>
                Dear sir<lb/></p>
            <p>A certain D. A. Cohen who resides in No 22 Little<lb/> Abe&#91;&#63;&#93; St&#44; wrote to the late Revd Isaac Leeser&#44; and since his decease<lb/> to myself&#44; in order that proper influence might be exercised to<lb/> induce a man named Barnet Da Costa to divorce his wife&#44; when<lb/> he deserted after she bore him a son.  I took interest in<lb/> the case.  I sought out the husband&#44; heard from his &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> lips that he had abjured the ancestral religion to embrace Christianity&#44;<lb/> and having summoned him before the Ecclesiastical Board of which I am<lb/> the secretary&#44; obtained from him the promise that he would sever<lb/> the connexion that bound an innocent woman to a guilty man.<lb/>  As the former belongs to the German Congregation&#44; I wrote to Mr A D<lb/> Cohen&#8212;after consulting with my colleagues&#8212;that he should inquire<lb/> of Dr Adler&#44; whether he would recognize a &#91;Hebrew&#93; received through the<lb/> post&#45;office when drawn according to the proper form &#40;as I believe that in some extraordinary case as the present&#44;<lb/> such means had been employed and sanctioned by the authorities&#41;.  The<lb/> answer was unfavorable.  Meanwhile a person named also Cohen<lb/> was introduced to me&#44; and stated that he had been deputed by Mr D. A<lb/> Cohen of London to act as &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and begged that for the sake of<lb/> the woman&#44; whose character was irreproachable&#44; I should endeavour<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>to further the object of his mission.  I received also communi&#45;<lb/>cations from New York to the same effect&#44; but though I deem<lb/> the request a legitimate one&#44; and since which <del>ought to</del> enlists<lb/> my &#91;&#63;&#93;est sympathy&#44; <del>still&#44;</del>  I cannot act in the premises&#44; because<lb/> I have reasons to fear that my exertions would avail nothing.<lb/>  Yet&#44; my feelings will not permit me to abandon the case altogether&#59;<lb/> wherefore I resolved to&#8212;unofficially&#45;&#45;seek of you&#44; dear sir&#44; some<lb/> imperative as to the real character of the woman&#44; and as to the opinion<lb/> of Dr Artom&#91;&#63;&#93; <del>touching</del> upon the subject.  I was told that he acknowledges<lb/> no man in America competent to officiate as Rabbi&#44; and consequently will<lb/> refuse<del>s</del> to cognize a &#91;Hebrew&#93; preformed in this country.  If it be so&#44; then<lb/> the wife of a wretched husband must for ever remain &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and be <del>if the</del><lb/> <del>refusal will not occasion some greater evil</del> exposed to shocking temptations&#59; but if&#44; as I believe&#44; he will<lb/> judge us less unfavorably &#40;I myself have never assumed the title of<lb/> Rabbi&#41; then&#44; a meritorious deed may be performed&#44; and we will all<lb/> have been instrumental in effecting it.<lb/></p>
            <p>I occasionally hear through Mr Henry Nathan your tidings and those<lb/> of the amiable Mrs A.  Present my kindest regards to Mrs Abrams<lb/> and remembrances to Mrs Lindo and daughters&#44; the Myers Ben &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; Mr<lb/> Azuelo and all inquiring friends&#44; and believe me yours<lb/></p>
            <p>unabated &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/>
                very truly and respectfully<lb/></p>
