            <p>A lecture on Vayesheb<lb/> exhorting youths to imitate<lb/> Joseph&#39;s character.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>&#34;Jacob dwelt in the land of his father&#39;s sojourning&#44;<lb/> in the land of Canaan&#34;.  Brethren&#33;  The Rabbis<lb/> in the Medrash&#44; commenting upon the passage&#44; with<lb/> which our Parasha begins&#44; remark that&#44; judging from<lb/> the checkered life of Jacob&#44; we may infer that it is<lb/> not in the wise dispositions of Providence&#44; always to<lb/> award to the righteous&#44; perfect <sic>tranquillity</sic> here below&#59;<lb/> but that He subjects them to trials&#44; the remembrance of<lb/> which will heighten in their spiritual eyes the unalloyed<lb/> peace reserved for them hereafter.  They express themselves<lb/> as follows&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Jacob sought now<lb/> to abide at ease&#44; but Joseph&#39;s trouble came on.  God<lb/> said&#58; let the happiness opportuned unto the just in<lb/> the future world&#44; suffice as a full recompense.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>But aside from that important teaching&#44; conveyed<lb/> by the words of our Sages&#44; the scriptural narrative<lb/> designated for this sabbath&#44; is fraught with other lessons<lb/> of moral value.  I will endeavour briefly to present<lb/> them&#44; for the special benefit of the junior portion of my hearers.<lb/></p>

            <p>Dear young friends&#33;  The sacred history<lb/> introduces us into a family&#45;circle.  There sits<lb/> the aged father&#44; whose brow early cares have furrowed.<lb/>  In youth&#44; he had been an object of the fondest<lb/> love to a mother indiscreetly partial.  His obe&#45;<lb/>&#45;dience to her orders&#44; when it involved the perversion<lb/> of truth&#44; made him an exile from the home&#44; where his<lb/> affections were centred.  In manhood&#44; human cove&#45;<lb/>&#45;tousness&#45;&#45;that monster&#44; which&#44; like the horse lead&#44;<lb/> described in the book of proverbs&#44; cries incessantly &#34;give&#44; give&#44;&#34;<lb/>&#45;&#45;set against him&#44; hindered for years his temporal<lb/> success.  When after having long borne &#34;the draught<lb/> by day&#44; and the frost by night&#34; he had gained a<lb/> competence&#44; through a contrivance&#44; which only the pressure<lb/> of surrounding circumstances&#44; could justify&#44; and he<lb/> was wending his way to the country of his birth&#44; he<lb/> met at its entrance&#44; a seeming opposition&#44; which<lb/> filled him with consternation and dread.  When that<lb/> had been overcome&#44; by the merciful interposition of<lb/> the Lord&#44; who softened the heart of Esau&#44; he<lb/> suffered shame&#44; danger&#44; and horror&#44; by the abduction<lb/> of his only daughter&#44; and the cruel vengeance taken<lb/></p>

            <p>by two of his sons.  And&#44; when almost at the<lb/> threshold of the parental dwelling&#44; he anticipated<lb/> nothing but joy&#44; he met with the sorest of domestic<lb/> afflictions.  The wife for whose sake he had<lb/> toiled and drudged under a wily employer&#44; was pre&#45;<lb/>maturely torn from his arm by the angel of death.<lb/>  Yet&#44; time that heals our wounds&#44; applied also<lb/> its balm to Jacob&#39;s bleeding heart&#44; and the devotion<lb/> of his children&#44; became a restorative to the patriarch<lb/> of his declining age.  Humanly speaking&#44;<lb/> he might have enjoyed this state of quietness<lb/> to the end of his life&#44; but one of the basest passions<lb/> which man can harbor in his breast&#44; disturbed the harmony of<lb/> the household.  Dear friends&#33;  Of all<lb/> studies that of the human heart is the most difficult.<lb/>  Few can penetrate its folds&#44; and see it in all its<lb/> nakedness&#44; but Solomon understood it well&#44; when<lb/> he declared &#34;envy&#34; to be a subtle disposition&#44; which&#44;<lb/> while seeking to injure&#44; receives the greatest injury.<lb/>  Because he perceived its onward working&#44; by the eye of<lb/></p>

            <p>inspiration&#44; he asserted that whosoever<lb/> entertains it&#44; undermines his own existence.<lb/>  &#34;Envy is rottenness to the bones&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Pride is despicable&#44; arising from an overweening estimate<lb/> of our worth&#44; and a disparaging opinion of other persons.<lb/>  It is despicable&#44; because&#59; though we were the handsomest<lb/> and the greatest&#44; the gifts we enjoy are only favors<lb/> from the Supreme&#44; still while latent&#44; pride may<lb/> gratify the silly individual who is flushed thereby&#44; and<lb/> harm none of his fellow&#45;creatures.  Irritability is<lb/> very reprehensible.  It may trample&#44; in its outburst&#44;<lb/> upon the most sacred duties&#44; nevertheless&#44; then may<lb/> be found accompanied with it&#44; noble impulses&#44; and<lb/> by dint of gentle reasoning&#44; and suavity of man&#45;<lb/>&#45;ners&#44; that evil disposition may be brought under<lb/> control&#59; but envy even in a passive state&#44; shows<lb/> its pernicious effects.  Have you ever observed in<lb/> the summer evenings the winged moth&#44; whirling<lb/> around the flame&#44; which will at last consume it&#63;<lb/>  Even like it&#44; its envy.  To him that entertains it&#44; the<lb/> happiness which others enjoy&#44; is an &#91;&#63;&#93; canker&#44; corroding his<lb/> body.  Their honor&#44; he considers his own <sic>degredation</sic>&#44; and<lb/></p>

            <p>and he repines&#59; their preferments in society are<lb/> looked upon by him as detrimental to his interests&#44;<lb/> and he chafes and frets.  Woe to the mind which is<lb/> so poisoned&#44; woe also unto the unfortunate creation&#44;<lb/> against whom envy gnashes its teeth.<lb/></p>
            <p>The first part of the history of Joseph&#44; which we<lb/> have just perused&#44; shows the direful results of<lb/> that passion on him&#44; against whom it is directed.<lb/>  Jacob&#39;s paternal love&#44; was felt towards all his off&#45;<lb/>&#45;spring&#44; but Joseph was the son so anxiously looked for&#44;<lb/> so &#91;&#63;&#93;fully asked of God by his dear Rachel&#44; that<lb/> now when she lay in her grave&#44; it seemed as if the a<lb/> twofold spring of life ran twofold through the child&#39;s veins.<lb/>  It seemed as if he claimed a double portion of<lb/> affection.  And as it naturally happens&#44; when<lb/> we love strongly&#59; Jacob imagined the object on whom<lb/> he bestowed the tenderest solicitude to be so perfect&#44;<lb/> as to call forth in every breast only the identical<lb/> feelings he cherished.  So did the fond parent believe&#44;<lb/> when he gave Joseph tokens of his predilections.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>But he knew not that his indiscretion had<lb/> sowed the seeds which brought forth rankling hatred.<lb/>  The sterling qualities he had discovered in Rachel&#39;s elder<lb/> son&#44; were not so apparent to the rest of his children.<lb/>  They believed they he was undeservedly held too high<lb/> among the members of one family.  Joseph was had<lb/> not&#44; in all likelihood been loth to show some degree of<lb/> superiority.  And the Scriptures relate that he would<lb/> at times create mischief by going tale&#45;bearing respecting<lb/> some of his brother&#39;s conduct.  In fact&#44; they regarded<lb/> his dreams are an indication of the ambitious notions<lb/> which his father&#39;s partiality had awakened.  Nur&#45;<lb/>&#45;turing long these <sic>rancourus</sic> sentiments&#44; their envy became<lb/> so terribly deep&#44; that it instigated a heinous<lb/> crime.  The death of Joseph was determined upon.<lb/>  Their scheme&#44; however&#44; did not meet with general<lb/> approbation.  Reuben came to the deliverance of the<lb/> innocent youth.  He was the first born son of<lb/> Jacob&#44; and maturer years had taught him experience.<lb/>  What his brothers condemned as a domineering<lb/> spirit&#44; he attributed to youthful imprudence.  Nor<lb/> did he view with the same jaundiced eyes the<lb/></p>

            <p>favoritism which Joseph enjoyed.  Though<lb/> he may have considered it unmerited&#44; still he would<lb/> not suffer it to beget misery and guilt.<lb/>  He would spare his hoary&#45;headed father the pangs<lb/> attending the loft of his darling son&#44; and he<lb/> endeavoured by his sanguine counsel to gain time&#44;<lb/> that he might restore security to one&#44; and peace<lb/> to all the members of the household.<lb/>
                But &#34;there is a Providence Divinity&#44; that shapes our ends.&#34;  The sove&#45;<lb/>&#45;reign mind that rules guides earthly events&#44; had predestined discovered<lb/> in the envied youth a being fit to become &#34;the ruler of all Pharaoh&#39;s<lb/> possessions&#44; to bind princes at will&#44; and teach se&#45;<lb/>&#45;nators wisdom.&#34;  How puny&#44; how insignificant<lb/> are man&#39;s designs when antagonistic to the will of<lb/> the Almighty Creator. &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#39;Joseph&#39;s brothers said&#58; We shall see what will become<lb/> of his dreams&#44; but a voice from above re&#45;echoed &#34;We shall<lb/> see&#34;; yes&#44; we shall see&#44; whose purpose will succeed.&#34;<lb/>  Thus&#44; my dear friends&#44; our Rabbins pithily si&#45;<lb/>gnify the watching of a never slumbering God<lb/> over His creatures.  The lad against whom&#44; envy<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p>would had <sic>levelled</sic> its destructive arrows&#59; the lad<lb/> whom envy would have crushed by bondage and ill&#45;<lb/>usage&#44; was that on whom the eye of the Lord was<lb/> set to crown him with glory and might.<lb/></p>
            <p>Yet many numerous and exceedingly grievous trials did he undergo&#44;<lb/> before that happy event was brought to pass.  How<lb/> he bore those sufferings&#44; is the study to which you&#44; my<lb/> dear young friends&#44; should devote your minds.<lb/></p>
            <p>Many a one&#44; seeing himself hated by those from whom<lb/> he should have expected forbearance at least&#44; if not<lb/> an entire overlooking of his slight faults&#44; and fraternal<lb/> forgiveness.  Perceiving that his imploring not to be<lb/> snatched away from a dear and aged father fell on hearts<lb/> of flint.  Finding himself mere chattel in the hands<lb/> of slave&#45;traders&#44; whereas he had been tended as the<lb/> most precious treasure&#44; many a one so woefully situated&#44; might<lb/> have been apt to murmur against Providence&#44; and<lb/> given admission to thoughts opposite to goodness<lb/> and virtue.  He might have conceived that<lb/> cunning promises better success than innocence&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>falsehood bears more agreeable fruits than<lb/> truth.  He might then have determined to resort<lb/> to craft and fraud and lying&#44; in order to overcome<lb/> the difficulties which  appeared to beset righteousness.<lb/>  But not so Joseph.  While under his father&#39;s an<lb/>&#45;xious care&#44; he may have evinced some foibles&#44; conse&#45;<lb/>&#45;quent upon his unripe age&#44; but when thrown on his own resources&#44;<lb/> he is the most virtuous&#44; the noblest most perfect of men.<lb/>  It mattered not to him&#44; if Poliphar was only his owner&#44;<lb/> who could dispose entirely of his life.  Enough that<lb/> he expected to receive his faithful services.  Joseph<lb/> rendered them with a degree of steadiness and integrity&#44;<lb/> which stands as a bright exemplar to all who<lb/> pledged themselves to labor for the interest of their em&#45;<lb/>&#45;ployers.  As bondman and an outcast&#44; poor<lb/> and undefended&#44; he still did not covet the riches placed<lb/> under his immediate control.  It might have been extremely easy<lb/> for him to share his master&#39;s wealth&#44; through the<lb/> treachery of a wicked wife.  But his soul repelled<lb/> the debasing idea.  The darkness gloom darkness of a dungeon&#44; was<lb/> a refulgent light to Joseph&#44; when compared with a<lb/> life of unfaithfulness and inq inequity.<lb/></p>

            <p>Cast into prison together with malefactors&#44; his up&#45;<lb/>&#45;rightness did not succumb to temptations.  The<lb/> companions who shared his sad fate&#44; might have offended<lb/> society.  Human justice might have demanded the<lb/> punishment they endured&#59; but he had committed no<lb/> crime.  Why should he not profit by the implicit reliance<lb/> of which the superintendent of the prison put on him to make his escape&#44;<lb/> regardless of the chastisement which  might have<lb/> been visited for it upon the latter&#63;  No&#58; to the<lb/> chief butler&#44; whose approaching release he predicted&#44;<lb/> Joseph said&#58; &#34;If thou wilt but think of me&#44; when it shall be<lb/> well with thee&#44; and show kindness&#44; I pray thee&#44; unto me&#44; and<lb/> make not mention of me unto Pharaoh&#44; and bring me<lb/> out of this house.&#34;  What submission to the decrees<lb/> of Providence&#33;  What deep consideration for the welfare<lb/> of other beings&#44; not to jeopardize it&#44; but rather<lb/> suffer discomfort and privations and gloom.  The victim<lb/> of calumny still rigidly honest&#44; a being in a state<lb/> of abjection&#44; yet highly honorable.<lb/></p>

            <p>The three sections which follow that we have<lb/> read this Sabbath&#44; from an episode of Biblical<lb/> history bringing to view a completion of human virtues.<lb/>  But you have been shown the lessons which our Parasha<lb/> conveys&#44; namely&#44; partiality begetting envy&#44; and this<lb/> giving rise to an inhuman act&#44; causing affliction&#44; and<lb/>&#45;&#45;as described hereafter&#45;&#45;biting remorse.  You have been<lb/> shown also how the fear of God sustained a youth&#44;<lb/> set upon by trials&#44; and exposed to seductions&#44; and you<lb/> have moreover been made to understand that if<lb/> natural promptings should&#44; even for a moment&#44; have<lb/> suggested subterfuge to avert sorrows&#44; his noble<lb/> soul revolted at the instigation&#44; and kept its snowy in&#45;<lb/>&#45;nocence.  Carry out the instruction in your daily walks.<lb/>  You will doubtless meet therein with allurements&#44; think then of<lb/> Joseph&#44; of his iron will to rise above all enticements.<lb/>  Imitate his conduct&#44; and you will be strong in virtue&#44;<lb/> you will be industrious&#44; and trust&#45;worthy.  You will be<lb/> considerate and kind and humble and though the exercise of those qua&#45;<lb/>&#45;lities&#44; may for a time&#44; appear fruitless&#44; you will still<lb/> cling to them&#44; from principle&#44; and feel most assured<lb/> that the eyes of God are upon you that the hopes you have<lb/> formed will not be cast off&#44; but you &#91;&#63;&#93; shall be equal to<lb/> your goodness.<lb/></p>
