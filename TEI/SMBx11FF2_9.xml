            <p>A lecture on the 14th anniversary<lb/>
                of the 7th st Synagogue.<lb/></p>
            
            <p>After having written it&#44; I discovered I made a<lb/>
                mistake regarding the occasion that called forth<lb/>
                Washington&#39;s reply to the Jews of Philadelphia.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Brethren&#33;<lb/>  What you may have read on Sunday last in a weekly paper&#44;<lb/> bespeaks your attention for that which will be presented to the<lb/> public upon Sunday next.  The answer of the father of this<lb/> country to the founders of this Congregation&#44; calls for reflection.<lb/>  It was the first time that George Washington became aware of<lb/> the existence of an organized body of men&#44; drawn together by<lb/> their attachment to the law of Sinai&#44; in the city which the<lb/> Continental Congress had immortalized.  Courteously he<lb/> acknowledged the invitation which his fellow citizens of<lb/> the Jewish faith extended to him as President of the young<lb/> republic&#44; and he improved the occasion by adding words<lb/> of sympathy with the cause of religious liberty generally&#44;<lb/> and of kindness for our people specially&#44; who had suf&#45;<lb/>&#45;fered much because of the world&#39;s intolerance.  The<lb/> circumstance which elicited that interesting document&#44; was<lb/> the dedication of a regular Synagogue by the Hebrews<lb/> of Philadelphia.  For some ten years&#44; and possibly<lb/> longer they had held service in a private dwelling&#59; but<lb/> the dignity of the worship and an accession of number from a neighboring city&#44;<lb/> necessitated the change.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>In Tishri 5543&#44; that is September 1872&#44; of the vulgar<lb/> era&#44; they entered a building&#44; intended to serve as a ral&#45;<lb/>&#45;lying point to their brethren coming from any part<lb/> of the globe&#44; and to show their fellow men of another<lb/> creed&#44; that &#34;the hope of Israel&#34; for the salvation of the<lb/> One God&#44; was not extinct in their breasts.  Our predecessors<lb/> who gave origin to the Congregation&#44; whose name we still<lb/> bear&#44; were not ashamed to acknowledge confess that the im&#45;<lb/>&#45;munities promised them by recent events&#44; had been in&#45;<lb/>&#45;capable of estranging their feelings from the ancient<lb/> belief.  And as an evidence of the pride they took in<lb/> keeping the same intact&#44; they requested the presence of<lb/> the temporal authorities at the consecration of their<lb/> new house of prayer.  It is uncertain that those<lb/> in powers witnessed the celebration&#44; but the reply sent<lb/> to the committee of arrangements by the most exalted of<lb/> Americans then&#44; and the most revered of revolutionary<lb/> fathers since&#44; proves a fact worthy to be remembered.<lb/></p>
            <p>Washington&#39;s expressions of of kindliness to the founders of a<lb/> congregation&#44; who gloried in their conservatism&#44; teaches<lb/> that we need not cater to the taste of fickle changelings&#44;<lb/> in order to secure the respect of the intelligent &#38; the good among the community.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>The Philadelphians who associated as a religious body<lb/> about ninety three years ago&#44; held a worship&#44; which<lb/> had nothing in common with that of the Nazarene church.<lb/>  The ritual was entirely in an Eastern language&#44; the chanting&#44;<lb/> popularly rendered&#44; made no pretensions to a musical<lb/> finish.  The ceremonies in the Synagogue&#44; msut have<lb/> struck the gentiles as being singularly different from<lb/> their practices.  Nevertheless the Phillipses&#44; and the Gratzes<lb/> and their co&#45;workers in the cause of Judaism experienced<lb/> no hesitation in inviting the brightest most distinguished in the State and<lb/> in the land to see how the olden worship was conducted.<lb/>  They wrote that as the dwelling of the Lord&#44; in which they<lb/> would pour forth their entreaties had just been completed&#44;<lb/> they would feel honored&#44; whenever the constituted authorities<lb/> judged proper to visit it. The fear that they might<lb/> excite ungracious remarks by their covered heads&#44; and by<lb/> their white fringed scarfs&#59; by their carrying separating<lb/> the sexes&#44; by their carrying to and from the desk ark the scroll<lb/> of the law&#44; or by other observances connected principally with the<lb/> autumnal holdings&#44; did not disturb the minds of those unsophisti&#45;<lb/>&#45;cated Hebrews.<lb/></p>

            <p>They relied for the consideration of the existing government&#44; not<lb/> on the abandonment of ancestral usages in the Synagogue&#44;<lb/> but on their social standing beyond its holy precincts.<lb/>  And Because the name of Jew had not been tainted du&#45;<lb/>&#45;ring the revolutionary war.  Nay&#58; because it had proved<lb/> conspicuously pure&#44; when a Hyam Solomon aided the<lb/> struggling republic with voluntary loans&#44; for which he asked<lb/> neither &#34;<sic>usory</sic> nor increase&#34;&#44; because&#44; as officially admitted&#44;<lb/> the Jew taxed his own purse and his own blood in the<lb/> defense of American independence&#44; therefore the originators<lb/> of this Congregation challenged public regard&#44; and obtained<lb/> as a testimony thereof of their worthiness a letter couched in respectful<lb/> language by the first president of the United States.<lb/>  It might be instructive&#44; and to some of my hearers<lb/> exceedingly interesting to read a full history of the<lb/> commencement and development of a Congregation Hebrew congregation&#44; re&#45;<lb/>&#45;cognized as such for upwards of nen ninety two years&#44;<lb/> and having the same very probably assumed the same appellation&#44;<lb/> and followed the same traditional rites Sephardic liturgy at a period dating<lb/> still further back.  But in the early days of its exist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ence&#44; no attempt appears to have been made&#44; to keep<lb/> clear and complete records of transpiring events.<lb/></p>

            <p>This&#44; however&#44; is doubtless&#59; the Mikv&#232; Israel congre&#45;<lb/>gation&#44; enjoying esteem noted for the position of its members&#44;<lb/> remained the only organized body in possession of a place<lb/> of worship for a considerable length of time&#59; and until<lb/> the year 5620&#44; or 1860 it performed divine service in<lb/> the same spot originally originally dedicated.  Fond<lb/> associations clustering around that caused many to part structure&#44;&#45;&#45;which&#44; though<lb/> remodelled&#44; had ever stood where the foundations had first been<lb/> laid&#44;&#45;&#45;caused many to part with it in tears&#44; but neither<lb/> the locality nor the building itself would permit a lon&#45;<lb/>&#45;ger continuance.  Thus it happened in that fourteen<lb/> years ago at this season&#44; the stately edifice we occupy<lb/> was consecrated with due solemnity to the service as a habitation<lb/> of Israel&#39;s God.  Here I pause&#59; for thoughts crowd on<lb/> my mind&#44; which I do not wish desire to shape into words.<lb/>  The day we have gathered to celebrate is doubly joyful<lb/> to the believers in revelation.  The remnant of Judah<lb/> hail everywhere the anniversary of the historical incident&#44;<lb/> which set the basis of human civilization.  On the sixth of<lb/> Sivan&#44; the Lord invisible and incomprehensible&#44; sent His word<lb/> among the ten&#45;thousands of His redeemed creatures.<lb/></p>

            <p>It bid them go forth and become the priests of truth.<lb/>  And upon the self&#45;same day a people who recognized<lb/> the Creator as the Parent of blessings brought to the Jerusalem&#45;temple amidst the<lb/> blithesome sound of blithesome music and national songs to the<lb/> Jerusalem Temple&#44; the first&#45;ripe fruits of the soil&#44; as a<lb/> token of filial gratitude.  Allusions to occurrences not<lb/> of a soul&#45;enlivening nature would ill&#45;comport with &#34;the<lb/> feast of the weeks.&#34;  &#34;This is the day which the Lord hath<lb/> appointed&#44; we will be glad and rejoice thereon.&#34;  But<lb/> with every disposition to intensify rather than dampen the<lb/> pleasure of our festive communion&#44; I feel that I would<lb/> be derelict in duty&#44; if in the after a silence of years on a<lb/> subject I have at heart&#44; I failed again to present<lb/> it for consideration.  Brethren&#33;  Fourteen annual<lb/> cycles have girded the earth&#44; since we promised that<lb/> this terrestrial Beth&#45;El would veritably be in all truth the house<lb/> of God.  &#34;But the stone crieth out of the wall&#44; and<lb/> the beam from the timber answereth with lament.&#34;  The<lb/> latter was hewn to adorn the Tabernacle of the Most<lb/> High&#44; the former passed through the chisel to beautify<lb/> the mansion of prayer.  They utter complaints&#44; because<lb/> they were not exclusively devoted altogether to the sacred purpose.<lb/></p>

            <p>They bewail their fate&#44; because the stranger may in<lb/> part claim possession of our minor Sanctuary.<lb/>  How earnestly I preached the necessity of rolling away<lb/> that shame&#44; is well known.  The personal exertions<lb/> I made to free the habitation in which I minister from an oppressive<lb/> burden many will remember.  But as my efforts<lb/> instead of <sic>benefitting</sic> the cause&#44; raised ill&#61;founded&#44; and<lb/> to me painful&#44; suspicions&#44; I resolved to bear forbear&#44;<lb/> trusting to time and circumstances for the removal of an<lb/> evil I could never cease to deprecate.  In fact&#44; a smaller provisions began<lb/> surplus began to be set apart&#44; to be made to compass that desirable end&#44; and that those I hoped&#44; would swell progress<lb/> and be matured so that by means of liberal donations&#44; and bequests till its reached a congregational duty<lb/> the sum due. would be fulfilled.  But the living became unmindful of the<lb/> wants of the Synagogue&#44; and the wealthy who were called<lb/> away from earth bequeathed nothing&#44; by which their<lb/> memory might become associated for ever with the house<lb/> of their God&#59; while their loss to it stopped short the<lb/> increase of the amount reserved for the gradual li&#45;<lb/>&#45;quidation of its debt.  Brethren&#33;  Friends&#33;  Or&#45;<lb/>thodox Israelites&#33;  To secure your venerable institution<lb/> against casualties&#44; that liquidation must be effected.<lb/>  It must be affected soon&#44; unless you desire a gradual<lb/> dissolution of your religious body<lb/></p>

            <p>I am not sounding the alarm to create a sensation&#59;<lb/> nor do I speak so&#44; believe me&#44; from interested selfish motives.<lb/>  My race is pretty nigh run out&#44; and should I even be destin&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed to go beyond the point I imagine to reach&#44; I shall<lb/> not in all likelihood outstrip the course of your congregational existence.<lb/>  At all any events&#44; preso personally&#44; I aspire to nothing<lb/> in this world higher than my present humble condition.<lb/>  But I long sincerely to see your olden organization&#44; during<lb/> my ministration&#44; firmly&#44; immoveably set up.<lb/>  It would be cruel in me to call forth sad reflection&#44; but<lb/> you know are aware that your ranks have unhappily been thin&#45;<lb/>&#45;ned within a recent brief space of time&#59; and my eyes<lb/> have grown dim in looking for a supply of fresh and<lb/> numerous recruits.  I may err in my judg&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment&#44; but I am of opinion that a reduction in the<lb/> seat rent&#44; &#40;though comparatively moderate even now&#41;&#44;<lb/> might materially augment our number&#44; strengthen<lb/> the cause for which our fathers established the<lb/> congregation Mikv&#232; Israel&#44; and add solemnity<lb/> to our devotional assemblies&#59; for &#34;in the multitude of people<lb/> is the King&#39;s honor&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>But the plan suggesting itself to my mind is totally<lb/> impracticable&#44; so long as an incubus lies upon us&#44; and<lb/> hinders our free motions.  And surely no devise of<lb/> yours others&#44; but which to draw herein a new vitalizing<lb/> element through more melody and choicer preaching<lb/> can be accomplished&#44; if a heavy account weighty obligation that should<lb/> have never been opened contracted&#44; is not adjusted.<lb/></p>
            <p>Once more I suffer me to appeal to you my brethren when the Almighty has<lb/> blessed in the city and in the field.  Give glory to His<lb/> name&#44; even while you are permitted to enjoy life<lb/> in the sweet companionship of wife and in the endearments of<lb/> loved children.  Bring but a small portion of your substance<lb/> to this dwelling&#45;place&#44; and it will soon be in very<lb/> deed God&#39;s holy house.  To render their sacred dedicated mansion<lb/> such&#44; the Gratzes and Phillipses and their worthy associates undertook ninety two<lb/> years ago a noble work.  You should give it perpetuity.<lb/>  You should make it honorable.  They came forward<lb/> with free&#45;will offerings adequate to the occasion&#44; you<lb/> should add to their hundred fold&#44; because the increase<lb/> is proportionate to our the changes in time and to our present requirements.<lb/>  And what season can be more appropriate than that we ce&#45;<lb/>&#45;lebrate for&#44; to laying upon the altar of our heavenly Benefactor<lb/> a handful out of the abundance He has showered down on<lb/></p>

            <p>your laps.  On the feast of weeks Israel of yore<lb/> presented to the priest a token indicative of their depend&#45;<lb/>&#45;ence on Providence for the satisfaction of the most urgent<lb/> necessities of life.  They made two loaves of bread from the<lb/> pure white wheat just grown&#44; and conveyed them to the<lb/> Palestinian Sanctuary.  Let the evidence of your depending<lb/> upon a beneficent God for all you need&#44; be equally signi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ficative.  Ere the rich delightful <sic>yeilding</sic> of your land be land on<lb/> the family board&#44; set apart a portion of the means that procure<lb/> you rich food and dainties&#44; and devote it to the service of the<lb/> Great Benefactor.  Oh&#33; let your commemorating of the day of<lb/> Sinai&#44; be thus find thus a practically illustration.  Let the fourteenth<lb/> anniversary of the Synagogue erected by the venerable congre&#45;<lb/>gation Mikv&#232; Israel&#44; be signalized by an act eminently<lb/> proper&#44; by a deed wil which will redeem our character&#44;<lb/> and show us good and pious&#44; generous and upright.<lb/></p>
