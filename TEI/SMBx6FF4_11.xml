            <p>Dr S. Morais Philada<lb/>
                My dear sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your highly valued &#38; very kind letter<lb/> of 7th reached me the first day Shabuagot.<lb/></p>
            <p>Appreciating your kind personal interest in my career<lb/> it gratifies me to write that since the appointment to<lb/> which you allude was received&#44; another honor was offered<lb/> to me but necessarily refused.  We have lately<lb/> consolidated with the city of Portland&#44; our sister cities<lb/> East Portland &#38; Albina on the East bank of our river&#44;<lb/> increasing our large &#38; valuable area&#44; giving us a<lb/> population of over 80000 and making us the 27th city of<lb/> the U. S. in importance &#91;&#63;&#93;.  The consolidation policy<lb/> are carried  by the citizens in opposition to the efforts<lb/> of all political rings &#38; politicians in the three places.<lb/>  It was generally conceded that the result was influenced<lb/> by the speeches I made during the campaign&#44; and in<lb/> nominating officers for the new city&#44; the position of mayor&#44; the head<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>of the ticket was offered to me by the citizens.  I was<lb/> given to understand that both Republicans &#38; Democrats<lb/> would endorse my nomination making it practically<lb/> unanimous.  Though I should have liked to accept&#44;&#45;&#45;<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; believe me&#44; to command additional respect for<lb/> our faith&#44; my business duties to my absent partners made<lb/> it absolutely necessary for me to refuse.  I have sent home<lb/> the papers containing the general history of all this.<lb/></p>
            <p>In relation to the Alliance&#44; I have not forgotten my promise<lb/> to try to do something in its behalf.  The time has not<lb/> yet been ripe for it&#44; I looked upon the Jewish Alliance<lb/> of America as my first duty and have been earnestly<lb/> working to establish a substantial branch here.  This work<lb/> will I think be successfully concluded during the<lb/> next week  It has been slow on several accounts.  First<lb/> on account of our subscription to the California colonization<lb/> scheme amounting to over &#36;20 000&#44; secondly to rather quiet business<lb/> times and ever increasing home calls upon our coreligionists&#44;<lb/> which have really been excessive&#44; for having established<lb/> the reputation of being a liberal community&#44; every possible<lb/> advantage is taken of the fact from all sources.  I go so often<lb/> to the people that I begin to feel myself a bore.  However&#44;<lb/> I shall when the chance of success offers remember to do<lb/> all possible for the Alliance&#44; and I think you can safely<lb/> count on some result before the close of the year.  I hear<lb/> nothing from the College.  Do they not send out bills&#63;  There must<lb/> be something due here.  With sincere regard very truly yours<lb/> D. Solis Cohen<lb/></p>
