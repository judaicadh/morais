                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. Fifth St.<lb/></p>
            <p>Philadelphia&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>To have been asked to exercise at this moment consideration and gentleness&#44; was<lb/> not at all offensive to my sense of self&#45;respect.  I venture<lb/> to say that in more than one instance those qualities were<lb/> found wanting&#44; and sorrow became intensified by reason<lb/> of it.  But I may assure every one of my fellow creatures&#44;<lb/> be they of my own creed&#44; or of another faith&#44; that I do not<lb/> need the caution&#44; in order to put into practice the kindness<lb/> which humanity dictates.  I hold with the Sages of<lb/> Israel&#44; that servants of God are &#91;Hebrew&#93; healers of souls&#44;<lb/> not tearers of hearts which are already very nigh lacerated<lb/> by grief.  When ministers cannot apply a restorative<lb/> balm&#44; they should not have recourse to instruments which<lb/> harrow and torment.  I do feel that in the case now<lb/> presented to our vision&#44; is strongly calculated to elicit<lb/> expressions of a fanciful character.  For although&#44; as<lb/> philosophers reason&#44; we all know that to die is a<lb/> process as natural as that of being born&#44; or&#44; as the<lb/> great Mendelssohn writes in his Phaedon&#44; the moment we<lb/> see the light of day&#44; we make the first move towards our grave&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>still&#44; the cold reasonings of philosophy will not al&#45;<lb/>&#45;lay distress.  The Almighty has wisely im&#45;<lb/>&#45;planted in our breast a love for life&#44; so that we may<lb/> exert our faculties to a purpose&#59; and we Israelites<lb/> pray for a long existence here below&#59; we eagerly<lb/> wish to continue the possession thereof to a very<lb/> late age.  Hence it happens that if we may<lb/> be reconciled to the loss of parents who have passed<lb/> away from our midst full of years&#44; we cannot so<lb/> argue ourselves into calmness&#44; when the young&#44; the<lb/> useful&#44; those whom we looked upon as indispensable<lb/> to our happiness&#44; are early taken from earth.<lb/></p>
            <p>My coreligionists who are now bereft of B...Hy....<lb/> have a sad cause for lamentations.  For young<lb/> he was&#44; in the very bloom of life&#44; and&#44; according to<lb/> our narrow vision&#44; we might have foreseen and pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;dicted long and joyous days in the sweet companion&#45;<lb/>&#45;ship of an equally youthful life&#45;&#45;co&#45;partner&#44;<lb/> and in the pleasures attending the growth of his<lb/> offspring.  His habits&#44; his general demeanour&#44; his industry had<lb/> made him important&#44; to those who clustered around<lb/> him with fond love.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>I profoundly sympathise with his wife&#44; and<lb/> with his children&#44; alas&#33; of an age too small tender to realize their loss.<lb/>  I can conceive the sorrow which has seized the parents&#44;<lb/> compelled to consign to the grave a son in his prime&#44;<lb/> with prospects brightening before him.  I can<lb/> imagine the pain experienced by fond dear relatives.<lb/>  Mortals cannot procure such consolations as the<lb/> afflicted need.  They may exhaust their power of<lb/> speech to no avail&#59; but religion&#44; the belief that death<lb/> is not destruction&#44; and the energy which that belief imparts&#44;<lb/> can gradually dissipate sorrow.  For when we remem&#45;<lb/>&#45;ber that we have sacred duties to perform in honor of the<lb/> dead whose spirit lives&#44; then the blissful occupation at&#45;<lb/>&#45;tending the discharge of such obligations removes gloom&#44;<lb/> and kindles within our souls with the light of self&#45;satisfaction.<lb/>  To the family now in affliction I am bid therefore<lb/> to say in the name of religion&#58; Friends&#44; the correct<lb/> training of the progeny of your B.....should be<lb/> your joint endeavours.  Upon the young widow<lb/> the heaviest burden has been laid.  Her it behooves<lb/> to watch over the health of her little son and daughter.<lb/>  The shaping of their hearts and minds is entrusted<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>into her hands&#44; but those who loved the deceased must<lb/> aid her effectually in her difficult undertaking&#44; they<lb/> must inspire her with the courage of perseverance&#44;<lb/> with the strength of a continuity which is not appalled<lb/> by obstacles.  Such is my earnest exhortations in<lb/> the name of the believe that teaches immortality and<lb/> the exercise of fraternal kindness towards one another.<lb/>  And Thou universal Lord&#44; whom our Psalmist pro&#45;<lb/>claimed &#39;Father of the fatherless and defender of the<lb/> widows&#39; let the heavenly grace &#38;c &#38;c &#38;c &#38;c.<lb/></p>
