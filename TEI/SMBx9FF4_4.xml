            <p>Some explanation on Parashat Vayor&#225;<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Brethren&#33;  I will detain you a few moments with the soloing of a<lb/> question&#44; which arises from an incident narrated in our Parash&#225;.  It is written<lb/> in it&#44; that Sarah was reproved for laughing&#44; when promised a son in her old<lb/> age&#59; yet&#44; last sabbath we read that Abraham also laughed when assured<lb/> by the Lord of the same forthcoming event&#44; and he received no rebuke.<lb/>  The various manners in which the Jewish commentators I have consulted&#44; en&#45;<lb/>&#45;deavoured to reconcile the discrepancy&#44; failed to satisfy my mind altogether.<lb/>  I shall not fatigue you with the exposition of their views.  I will rather<lb/> submit to your consideration the opinion I have formed.  It strikes me<lb/> that the words of the text&#44; when duly pondered upon&#44; may serve as a clue<lb/> to find how to remove the difficulty.  It is stated in Holy Writ&#44; that<lb/> when the announcement was first made to Abraham&#44; &#34;he fell upon his<lb/> face&#44; and laughed&#44; and said in his heart&#44; shall a child be born unto him<lb/> that is a hundred years old&#44; and shall Sarahs&#44; who is ninety years old bear&#63;&#34;<lb/>  Now&#44; the act of bowing oneself down&#44; is&#45;&#45;judging from biblical analogy&#45;&#45;&#44;<lb/> signification of humility.  I argue then that when the patriarch was told<lb/> that his aged wife would become the mother of a son&#44; he deemed himself unworthy<lb/> of so wonderful a favor from God.  He had thought that Ishmael would<lb/> perpetuate his memory&#44; and that the heavenly declarations made&#44; would be<lb/> fulfilled in the descendants of Hagar&#39;s child.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Therefore he fervently prayed that the latter w might live under the signal<lb/> protection of the Almighty &#91;Hebrew&#93;  Abraham asked for nothing<lb/> more.  He dared not believe that for his sake the laws of nature would be<lb/> altered.  His laughter did not proceed from any doubt in the omnipotence<lb/> of the Creator&#44; but from a sense of his own unworthiness.  It was a smile&#45;<lb/>rising spontaneously at the idea that an occurrence&#44; which the human mind<lb/> could not entertain&#44; should take place.  The fact that the name &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Isaac&#41;<lb/>&#45;&#45;meaning in Hebrew&#44; &#34;he would laugh&#34;&#45;&#45;was expressly chosen by God&#44; as an<lb/> allusion to that circumstance&#44; goes far to confirm the position I have taken.<lb/>  An appellation indicative of a token of incredulity&#44; would not have been divinely<lb/> selected for the second patriarch of our people.<lb/>
                But with regard to Sarah&#44; the context proves that she had allowed her feeble<lb/> judgment to shake her confidence in the promises of the Lord.  It is but<lb/> reasonable to suppose&#44; that Abraham had informed his wife of the vision granted<lb/> him&#44; in which the assurance that she would embrace a son&#44; within a<lb/> year&#44; was given.  Consequently&#44; when he overheard the conversation between<lb/> her husband and the three angels&#44; who came in the form of wayfarers&#44; she<lb/> ought not to have evinced hesitation in according full credence to what<lb/> had been celestially promised.  The announcement corroborative of<lb/> that which she had learnt before&#44; ought to have strengthened her faith.<lb/>  But the words she uttered&#44; accompanied with her ill&#45;suppressed laugh&#44;<lb/> showed that she would not bring her mind to accept a truth&#44; which<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>her condition seemed openly to contradict.  And we may consider<lb/> what follows&#44; as a further evidence that such were in reality her feelings.<lb/>  For&#44; the reproof she received was this &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Is any thing too hard<lb/> for the Lord&#63;&#34; implying that Sarah could not yet admit the possibility of a<lb/> miracle so stupendous as that which she was to experience.  Hence&#44; the fear<lb/> of being looked upon by the faithful patriarch&#44; as faithless&#44; drew from her<lb/> lips a denial of facts&#44; equally reprehensible as the sin of unbelief.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am aware that my exonerating Abraham from a fault&#44; which seemed<lb/> to rest on his religious conduct&#44; presents&#44; by way of contrast&#44; the demeanour<lb/> of Sarah&#44; in a still more unpleasant light.  But to strain the obvious<lb/> meaning of the Bible&#44; in order to &#91;&#63;&#93; shortcomings&#44; I deem &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> I will not&#44; intentionally&#44; be guilty of it.  The manner in which I have<lb/> sought to reconcile two actions apparently alike&#44; but meeting with different<lb/> results is borne out&#44; I think&#44; by the whole context.  And the Rabbis&#45;&#45;<lb/> holding both parents of our race in great reverence&#44; have not scrupled<lb/> to write that &#34;had it not been for the assurance&#44; which the Almighty<lb/> gave Abraham of his having a son from Sarah&#44; the incredulity she<lb/> exhibited&#44; would have prevented her becoming a mother&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> But if I am forced by truth to show blemishes&#44; where I would<lb/> desire to describe perfection&#44; I may cite the very event&#44; which<lb/> occasioned a backsliding in Sarah&#39;s behaviour&#44; as a testimony of a<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>noble trait in her character.  She was hospitable.  She contributed<lb/> in making the stranger welcome in her house.  Not by mere words&#44; but<lb/> by personal exertions&#44; so that a table laden with food be set before him.<lb/>  The reflection that her husband&#39;s guests might have been heathens&#44; did<lb/> not withhold her kindness.  Suffice that they had sought shelter<lb/> under her roof.  They should not leave it fatigued and hungry.<lb/>  They should be made to feel that the adorers of One God&#44; are fraternally<lb/> disposed towards all creatures.  She was modest.  Satisfied to labor<lb/> to do good&#44; and forward Abraham&#39;s wishes&#44; Sarah continued retired in<lb/> her tent&#44; esteeming herself well recompensed when her household duties were<lb/> accomplished.  Thus she set to posterity an example deserving of imitation.<lb/>  All&#45;honor to our mother Sarah.  Let the women of Israel avow her faults&#44;<lb/> but copy her virtues.  Let them display a spirit as liberal&#44; and a conduct<lb/> as modest as their ancestress.  The actions they exhibit&#44; will influence<lb/> their husbands&#44; and children&#44; and through them three will remain<lb/> in Israel&#44; the three distinguishing characteristics&#44; applied by the<lb/> Sages to the progeny of Abraham and Sarah&#44; namely &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;The people of Israel are known&#44; for their mer&#45;<lb/>cifulness&#44; for their modesty&#44; and benevolence.  So may it ever be&#34;.  Amen.<lb/></p>
