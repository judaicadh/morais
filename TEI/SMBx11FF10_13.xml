            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>
                PHILADELPHIA&#44; PA.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>If I believed that my province is to draw forth tears<lb/> and sighs and to intensify the grief of the bereaved&#44; I<lb/> would find the means to do so readily in the present in&#45;<lb/>&#45;stance.  I could picture in the gloomiest colors<lb/> the terrible fall&#44; the horror that seized the affrighted<lb/> daughter&#44; the inexpressible shock felt by the absent<lb/> wife when returning home&#59; I would describe relatives near<lb/> and far sorrow&#45;stricken at the sudden tidings of the unfor&#45;<lb/>&#45;tunate event&#44; a community that had favorably known Ernest<lb/> Nusbaum for a long series of years&#44; pained at his decease.<lb/>  But such is not my province.  I would rather let<lb/> my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth than show<lb/> the inglorious ability to make a house where a dear<lb/> dead lies unburied&#44; resound with lamentations.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am not unsymapthetic.  I do deplore the accident.<lb/>  I would have fervently prayed that my venerable Hebrew<lb/> brother had been vouchsafed a still longer existence and<lb/> an early transition from earth to heaven.  But since it<lb/> was not so ordained above&#44; I&#44; here below&#44; am commissioned<lb/> by my sacred office to act in the capacity of a skilful<lb/> chemist&#44; who possesses the knowledge of extracting<lb/> from poisonous substances healthful cures.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Ernest Nusbaum had exceeded the boundaries generally<lb/> accepted as the assigned terms of our terrestrial career&#44; when<lb/> the sad premonition was received that our coreligionist must<lb/> depart hence&#44; the suspense was not long nor agonizing&#44;<lb/> for&#44; consciousness soon ceased and a short week of a<lb/> semi unconscious illness afforded those who fondly loved<lb/> him&#44; the opportunity to lovingly minister to his wants<lb/> and strive to bring effective relief.  Let these consider&#45;<lb/>&#45;ations prove a source of comfort to all who will miss<lb/> a father&#44; a husband&#44; a relative&#44; a friend.  For&#44; I<lb/> have reasons to think that in each of those relations of<lb/> life&#44; our venerable coreligionist was never found wanting.<lb/>  Affectionate to the woman who&#44; in her youth&#44; had<lb/> sought in Ernest Nusbaum a congenial companion and<lb/> a trusty support&#44; paternally caring for the children<lb/> that she bore to him&#44; while under his immediate con&#45;<lb/>&#45;trol&#44; endowed with a jovial and cheerful disposition that<lb/> made him welcome everywhere&#44; our brother passed away<lb/> unencumbered by a dreadful weight that crushes the<lb/> soul&#59; I mean the consciousness of having <sic>wilfully</sic> com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mitted wrong&#44; determinedly set an example of immoral&#45;<lb/>&#45;ity and of disloyalty to the allegiance we owe Judaism.<lb/>  For pertinacious sinning kindles Divine wrath&#44; the<lb/> errors of our fallacious minds are covered under the wings of Mercy.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>To myself personally the touch of my venerable brother&#39;s<lb/> hand indicated a kindly disposition&#44; a desire to signify<lb/> that his sentiments were fraternal and amicable.  What&#45;<lb/>&#45;ever may be said to the contrary&#44; I hold that a pressure<lb/> of the hand&#44; an ingenious expression possess an eloquence<lb/> surpassing all high wrought speeches and studied ser&#45;<lb/>&#45;mons.  This loss will naturally be felt&#44; the<lb/> occasion that brought on the loss will naturally be<lb/> grieved over&#44; still&#44; the memorial of conjugal virtues<lb/> and personal good qualities must remain as a sooth&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing balm. For that I offer supplications&#59; especial&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly I pray on behalf of the widow&#44; whose bereave&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment is the greatest.  May filial ministra&#45;<lb/>&#45;tions of affection&#59; the kind considerations of all who<lb/> sprung from Mayer and Fanny Arnold alleviate the sorrow<lb/> caused by her husband&#39;s separation from her upon earth.<lb/>  Universal Father&#33;  Inspire them all with deep regard<lb/> for the relict of Thy servant Ernest Nusbaum.<lb/></p>
            <p>Into Thy hand&#44; O forgiving God&#33;&#44; we commit the soul<lb/> of our brother in faith.  At this time when his<lb/> undying spirit stands before Thy august tribunal&#44;<lb/> let the sentence issuing therefrom be&#44; joys of a life eternal<lb/> in the heavenly association of all the good and true and saints.<lb/>  Grant in this household be fulfilled the sentence of Thy prophet &#34;The Lord God<lb/> will wipe off tears from every countenance.&#34;<lb/></p>
