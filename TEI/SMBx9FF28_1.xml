            <p>Some remarks explanatory<lb/>
                of<lb/>
                a passage in Parashat Shophetim<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;  &#34;Thou shall be perfect with the Lord Thy<lb/> God&#34;  This sentence&#44; my dear Brethren&#33; is the summing up<lb/> of a lesson&#44; chronicled in the Parasha of this morning.  Moses&#44;<lb/> the man of God&#44; having warned our ancestors against following<lb/> the practices of the heathens in whose country they were about<lb/> to be established&#44; pointed out in two words how every Israelite<lb/> might avoid falling into the same errors.  He said &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Thou shalt be perfect.&#34;  Let me make the Hebrew expression<lb/> clear to your minds.  Its translation in the vernacular&#44;<lb/> scarcely conveys its meaning.  It is not human perfection&#44;<lb/>&#45;&#45;that moral excellence we should endeavour to attain in<lb/> our walks of life&#45;&#45;&#44; that the prophet recommends in the<lb/> present instance.  He wishes rather to form a<lb/> contrast between the religious feelings actuating the believers in<lb/> One beneficent Lord&#44; and those by which the <sic>worshippers</sic><lb/> in a multiplicity of duties are guided.  They who<lb/> see in nature a number of divine powers&#44; each distinct<lb/> from the other&#44; each capable of benefifting or injuring<lb/> man&#44; will easily become wedded to superstitions.<lb/>  In order to win the favor of some of those imaginary<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>gods&#44; they will commit acts at which sober reason<lb/> revolts.  So likewise to hold back the hand of some<lb/> other dreaded divinity&#44; they will <sic>yeild</sic> thereto the tenderest<lb/> sentiments instincts implanted by nature.  And designing<lb/> persons will always be found to encourage an ignorance<lb/> so mischievous in its results&#44; because promotive of<lb/> their own interest.  The Bible therefore purposely<lb/> given purposely to keep us sound in body and mind&#44; and fit us<lb/> for the discharge of the duties of life&#44; inveighs sharply<lb/> against any custom calculated to create a contrary effect.<lb/>  The opposition set by the laws of Moses to the religion<lb/> of the heathens&#44; has no other object than to shield us<lb/> from the evils it brings forth.  So in the seciton<lb/> we have read&#44; several of the practices of the Canaanitish<lb/> tribes&#44; are declared an abomination to the Lord&#44; and the<lb/> main cause of His having driven them away form their<lb/> land.  The first&#45; mentioned and the most heinous<lb/> is that which robbed parents of the innate feelings&#44; innate in. men&#44; and exposed their children to an untimely and<lb/> cruel death.  There exists an opinion&#44; that the service<lb/> offered to the Molack&#44; did not necessitate the burning<lb/> alive of innocent infants&#44; but merely their being made<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>to leap over the flames&#44; symbolic of their being a dedication<lb/> to the worship of that brutal idol.  When we&#44; however&#44;<lb/> compare all the sentences in Holy Writ in which reference is made<lb/> to that species of idolatry&#44; we must arrive at the conclusion<lb/> that the actual consuming by fire of one&#39;s sons and<lb/> daughters was the execrable service tendered.  Hence the<lb/> denunciations of the scriptures&#44; and the fearful condemnation<lb/> pronounced in these terms.  &#34;Whosoever he be of the children<lb/> of Israel.....that giveth any of his seed unto Molack&#44;<lb/> he shall surely be put to death&#58; the people of the land shall<lb/> stone him with stones.  And I will set my face against<lb/> that man&#44; and will cut him off form among his poeple&#59;<lb/> because he hath given of his seed unto Molock&#44; to defile<lb/> my sanctuary&#44; and profane my holy name&#34;&#44; signifying&#44;<lb/> that as the name of the Lord will be sanctified on earth<lb/> only by acts of righteousness and humanity&#44; the Hebrew<lb/> who deadened his feelings to do what the law abhors&#44;<lb/> is guilty of the severest char a crime&#44; deserving the severest<lb/> chastisement.<lb/></p>
            <p>But not only the observances which do violence to human<lb/> nature are declared in our Parasha hateful in the<lb/> sight of God.  Those sacred pages oppose with equal<lb/></p>

            <p>emphasis other usages having a tendency to deliver reason<lb/> and render intellectual beings the sport of fancied ills<lb/> and disturbing omens.
