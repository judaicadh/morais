                Dear friend &#38; teacher&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>I have long known that Isaac<lb/> was troubled by the apparent antagonism between<lb/> Science and religion and have encouraged him to<lb/> study science in order that better knowledge should<lb/> prove to him his error.  He came to me before<lb/> seeing you with a letter to you that I did not<lb/> approve of&#44; and I urged him to see you.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Philosophy&#34; as you use the term&#44; having in<lb/> mind principally&#44; <hi rend="underline">speculative</hi> doctrines&#44; like<lb/> those of Aristotle in the days of Hallevi&#44;<lb/> and &#34;science&#34; as we use the term today are<lb/> not the same&#45;&#45;are indeed irreconcilably op&#45;<lb/>posed.  The speculative doctrines are over&#45;<lb/>turned from age to age&#44; but the scientific<lb/> facts &#40;&#91;&#41;the Copernican&#44; Newtonian discoveries &#38;c&#40;&#93;&#41;<lb/> gain fresh confirmation daily.  No true<lb/> philosopher &#40;in the English sense&#44; Newton&#44; Faraday&#41;<lb/> can be other than deeply religious.  I have<lb/> especially commended to Isaac the writings<lb/> of Archdeacon Whewell&#44; who was the<lb/> most thoroughly equipped student of science<lb/> of his day&#45;&#45;and a believing Christian.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>If Christianity could be reconciled with<lb/> science by this great man&#44; Judaism offers<lb/> no difficulty.  In fact his reconcilement is<lb/> Judaic not Christian.  The Christianity is<lb/> mystic.  Whewell approached nearly to Hal&#45;<lb/>levi&#44; and no one can read him and doubt<lb/> that science enlarges the mind and increases<lb/> the force of a religious teacher.<lb/></p>
            <p>Our Jewish preachers must be thoroughly<lb/> equipped.  In your early career the foe<lb/> was within&#45;&#45;the spirit of laxity&#45;&#45;Reform<lb/>&#45;Radicalism.  The weapon most needed<lb/> was theologic&#59; Jewish.  Today&#44; while<lb/> Jewish knowledge is no less necessary for<lb/> the thorough equipment of a Jewish teacher&#44;<lb/> his greatest battles must be fought with a<lb/> different enemy.  Reform is dying of Radi&#45;<lb/>calism.  Some synagogal points are lost<lb/> to Orthodoxy beyond recall&#45;&#45;a right<lb/> reform in liturgy is inevitable and you<lb/> approve&#45;&#45;but on Jewish doctrine the<lb/> battle has been forgot and been&#45;&#45;despite<lb/> Hirsch &#38; Krauskopf.  They are creatures of<lb/> a day and their churches will die before<lb/> them.<lb/></p>
            <p>What our leaders must meet and<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>answer is a legitimate spirit of inquiry<lb/> from thinking men and women.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Here are certain proven facts of nature<lb/> seemingly opposed to your religion&#45;&#45;How<lb/> do you reconcile them&#63;&#34;  Our leaders<lb/> must know the full facts&#44; must know<lb/> science from the inside&#44; or their answers<lb/> become not only inadequate&#44; but to the<lb/> learned in science&#44; ridiculous&#45;&#45;ridiculous<lb/> not because they are without truth or strength&#44;<lb/> but because they fail to meet the real<lb/> issue&#59; they spill agog&#44; when the foe<lb/> before us is Goliath.<lb/></p>
            <p>Therefore&#44; if Isaac is to be one of our<lb/> leaders he must study physics and<lb/> chemistry&#44; and biology and geology.  He<lb/> must study too Assyriology and Egyptology.<lb/>  He must know the leading facts of<lb/> the metaphysical systems that he will<lb/> have to meet&#45;&#45;of Hume&#44; Berkeley&#44; Kant&#44;<lb/> Hegel&#44; Schopenhaur.  A happier generation<lb/> than his will follow&#44; that will be content<lb/> with Judaism&#45;&#45;but his generation will<lb/> be one of warfare and he must have armor<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>for he is not a David.<lb/></p>
            <p>Indeed I miss in Isaac&#44; the en&#45;<lb/>thusiastic inspiration&#45;&#45;the love of<lb/> Judaism&#44; the love of the teacher&#39;s mission<lb/>&#45;&#45;that I believe more needful than<lb/> great intellectual capacity.  I would<lb/> not pick him out for a minister&#45;&#45;<lb/> nor will he promise to <hi rend="underline">be</hi> a minister.<lb/>  He will study and we must be satisfied<lb/> with his decision after his studies are<lb/> completed.<lb/></p>
            <p>He will see you and try to<lb/> get your consent to this arrangement.<lb/>  Namely that he shall continue as a<lb/> seminary pupil&#44; but without binding<lb/> himself as to the future.  I have<lb/> no advice on this point&#45;&#45;but I doubt<lb/> whether Isaac will decide to<lb/> become a minister.  I am willing to<lb/> let that remain for the future if<lb/> you are.<lb/></p>
            <p>He is then to take two Hebrew<lb/> lessons weekly with Gerson &#38; a<lb/> third lesson&#44; if you wish&#44; in the<lb/> evening.  This will give him time for<lb/> Chemistry and part of Greek.  If not&#44; I prefer<lb/> his giving up Greek to Chemistry.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>But you must realize&#44; that<lb/> Isaac&#39;s main object&#44; now&#44; is to<lb/> obtain a University education  His<lb/> Seminary is a means to that&#45;&#45;not<lb/> that an aid to the Seminary.<lb/></p>
            <p>What your influence continued<lb/> through this critical period may do&#44; I<lb/> cannot say&#45;&#45;but &#40;if I read him aright&#45;&#45;&#38; I may be mistaken&#41; there is no real<lb/> love for the work in Isaac&#39;s heart<lb/> now&#45;&#45;he thirsts for knowledge&#44; that<lb/> is all.<lb/></p>
            <p>Liknaitz on the other hand<lb/> appears to me to be one who really<lb/> loves the work&#44; has made sacrifices<lb/> for it &#38; deserves to be encouraged.<lb/>  I will try to see you<lb/> with much love<lb/> Solomon<lb/></p>
