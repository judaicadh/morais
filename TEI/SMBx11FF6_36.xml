            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Bereaved friends.  If I wished to draw sighs from our<lb/> hearts and tears from your eyes&#44; I would say that your<lb/> loss is very very sad.  I would paint the anguish of a<lb/> blind mother&#44; who cannot enjoy even the melancholy<lb/> satisfaction of looking upon features&#44; she once delighted to<lb/> contemplate&#44; but who only hears the measured steps of men<lb/> carrying her only son to his lasting home.  I would<lb/> picture the poignant grief of a wife left in the middle course<lb/> of her existence without her main stay and support.  I would<lb/> describe the sorrow of sons and daughters deprived of a coun&#45;<lb/>&#45;sellor and a guide at an age when a father&#39;s influence is most<lb/> sensibly felt.  I would delineate the pain of relatives<lb/> some of whom sat at the table of my deceased brother in<lb/> faith&#44; and dwelt under his roof&#44; and others who visited<lb/> him often and cordially.  I know that if I were to speak<lb/> also of the suffering endured by this now decaying body&#44; and<lb/> of the trials of a farewell from a numerous family and<lb/> of this terrible separation&#44; I would make the very walls of<lb/> our hall echo forth groans and lamentations.  But such<lb/> is not my object&#44; such is not my desire.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Nay it is not my duty.  I think it would be a<lb/> misapplication of my calling.  The task assigned<lb/> to me on occasions like the present is the very opposite<lb/> of the work which a chemist will at  times follow.<lb/>  He will try to extract some deadly poisons out of the most<lb/> delicious fruits&#44; I&#44; on the contrary&#44; must draw sweet honey<lb/> out of the bitterest objects.  Yes&#44; my bereaved friends.  The<lb/> potion brought to your lips is acrid&#44; but it contains with&#45;<lb/>al a vast deal which is pleasant and even  grateful.<lb/>  Let me point it out.  Mayer Swizer has left a rich<lb/> legacy behind&#45;&#45;to wit&#44; a good name.  You aged mother<lb/> you mourning widow&#44; you hapless children you af&#45;<lb/>&#45;fectionate relatives and friends need not blush on<lb/> looking back at the record of this Israelite.  For sober<lb/> and moral he was&#44; quiet and hardworking he proved him&#45;<lb/>&#45;self.  This recollection alone is wealth.  But the de&#45;<lb/>&#45;parted has likewise bequeathed what will avert from his dear<lb/> ones the greatest trouble&#44; that is he has shown them the<lb/> way to proceed in industrial pursuits&#44; and not to need<lb/> the sower bread of the so called human charity.  But<lb/> what greater consolation&#44; my friends than to feel heart eased at<lb/> heart&#59; to feel that we have not set aside the principles of goodness.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Surely a wife who spent days and nights at the<lb/> bedside of her husband&#44; and regardless of her suffering<lb/> health administered every possible comfort&#44; smoothing<lb/> the aching pillow&#44; moisten the lips with a prayer till<lb/> the soul returned to God that gave it&#44; such a wife has<lb/> an abundant source of consolation.  So the children<lb/> who postponed business and studies and rest to the care<lb/> a father needed&#44; and the relatives who devoted weeks and<lb/> months to assuage the pangs of the diseased&#44; all of them<lb/> must now derive&#44; I will not say joy&#44; but gratification<lb/> from the knowledge of their irreproachable conduct.<lb/>  Oh let my poor words strike a deep root&#44; meditate thereon<lb/> ye friends and believe a sympathiser&#59; you will hereafter experience<lb/> unspeakable satisfaction on looking back even on the sad<lb/> hour.<lb/></p>
            <p>Here follows a prayer for consolation&#44; &#38; an exhortation<lb/> to the children to lighten the burden of a widowed mother.<lb/></p>
