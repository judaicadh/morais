            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Israelites.  Did no I not fear that my silence might<lb/> be construed into indifference&#44; or&#45;&#45;what would pain<lb/> me greatly more&#45;&#45;into uncharitableness&#44; I would<lb/> withhold&#44; in the present instance&#44; the obsequies ordi&#45;<lb/>&#45;narily performed.  All Israelites are aware that<lb/> signs of mourning and expressions of grief ill&#45;accord<lb/> with a festivity bibblically enjoined.  None of my<lb/> hearers need be told that on this day and the morrow<lb/> funereal rites and the subsequent mortuary services&#44;<lb/> are suspended.  But I prefer slightly to<lb/> trespass against the ordinances of our Sages to ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pearing before the bereaved&#44; as apathetic or unkind.<lb/>  I choose to deviate from accepted rules&#44; in order<lb/> to respond to the dictates of the heart.  Not<lb/> because I am eager to eulogise the dead&#44; but be&#45;<lb/>&#45;cause to exhort and to console the living&#44; is rea&#45;<lb/>&#45;sonably expected at my hands.  Nay&#44; it is my<lb/> solemn obligation&#44; as it is my earnest ardent wish.<lb/>  The dead are beyond the reach of human praises.<lb/>  Were I even in possession of materials to compose<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>an elaborate panegyric&#44; setting my deceased coreligionist<lb/> to view as surpassingly virtuous&#44; my commendation<lb/> would profit him nothing.  It would simply be<lb/> the utterance of a perishable being&#44; influencing in no<lb/> manner a future state.  I have gladly seen it<lb/> asserted that during a long series of years in the busy<lb/> marts of trade J R earned the title of &#34;Upright Mer&#45;<lb/>&#45;chant.&#34;  A noble title in all truth&#59; a title claiming<lb/> a badge of honor.  Let him who wore it enter fearlessly<lb/> the courts of the Great Judge.  For&#44; according to the<lb/> Talmudists&#44; the first question asked in the heavenly<lb/> tribunal is &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Hast thou dealt honestly&#63;&#34;<lb/>  But my laudation for his having done what it be&#45;<lb/>&#45;hooves all to do&#44; could not enhance his spiritual joy.<lb/>  Did my brother <sic>fulfil</sic> the commandments that<lb/> nature imposes&#63;&#45;&#45;to tenderly cherish the creatures to<lb/> whom we voluntarily give existence&#44; to rear and<lb/> hold them in the path of rectitude for their welfare<lb/> here and hereafter&#63;  God who has written those precepts<lb/> with His finger on the tablets of human hearts&#44; will<lb/> reward obedience.  Did he discharge the behests taught<lb/> by revelation&#63;&#45;&#45;to be holy in thoughts&#44; merciful in actions&#63;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>God who imparted such statutes by means of inspiration&#44;<lb/> will not let faithfulness go unremunerated.  My The en&#45;<lb/>&#45;comiums of a fallible mortal would neither retard&#44; nor<lb/> hasten the sentence of the infallible Lord.  But the<lb/> men and women who will never hear again the voice&#44; which<lb/> in the days of their infancy&#44; called them endearing<lb/> names&#44; never behold the face of him who labored for<lb/> them long and diligently&#44; who to promote their interest<lb/> sacrificed means&#44; and&#44; by his own testimony&#44; denied his<lb/> old age&#44; for their sake&#44; the sweets of a complete rest&#45;&#45;the<lb/> sons and daughters of J R Irwan&#44; should drop a tear<lb/> over this coffin.  I myself can recall the years&#45;&#45;happier<lb/> years perhaps&#45;&#45;when my coreligionist realized the Scriptural<lb/> blessing &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Thy wife is like a fruitful vine on the<lb/> sides of thy house&#44; thy children are like olive branches round<lb/> about thy table.&#34;  I was wont then often to visit that<lb/> house&#44; and witness that table.  Remembering now that<lb/> appearance sight&#44; I must ask that the deceased father<lb/> be made spiritually joyful above by the gratitude of<lb/> <sic>of</sic> the numerous offspring for whom he amply provided.<lb/>  How should should filial sentiments be evinced&#63;  To<lb/> those of J R&#39;s who have already raised a family amidst<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>the community of Israel&#44; I shall say in the name<lb/> of our religion &#34;Let the departed be gladdened above by the<lb/> consciousness that his descendants here below hold fast to<lb/> <sic>to</sic> the truths of Sinai&#44; that the honor of their faith is<lb/> precious in their eyes.&#34;  To them who have not reared<lb/> yet a household&#44; I shall point a duty which the Almighty<lb/> commands and this funeral demands.  Let them surround<lb/> their widowed mother with a shield&#44; preventing the arrows<lb/> of adversity striking her.  Being nearer to her that gave<lb/> them birth than others who have settled elsewhere&#44;<lb/> they may but cause the winter of her existence to glide<lb/> away free from the storms of misfortune&#44; calmly&#44; contentedly<lb/> such is my exhortation&#59; that is the consolation I offer to<lb/> a sister in faith&#44; who of all the relatives of J R&#44; is now<lb/> very naturally&#44; tried the most.  In the language of the Psalm&#45;<lb/>&#45;ist I exclaim &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;May the words of my mouth&#44; and<lb/> the intentions of my heart&#44; be acceptable to the Lord&#44; my<lb/> Rock and my Redeemer&#34;.  On this day devoted to the<lb/> celebration of a national festivity&#44; I shall not lengthen<lb/> my speech&#44; but I will pray that the virtues of the deceased<lb/> may be his advocates on high&#44; that his sins may be atoned<lb/> for by his bodily suffering&#44; that his wife&#44; his children and<lb/> all who mourn because of his departure&#44; may deserve to feel the realization of<lb/> the prophetic sentence &#34;I shall turn their mourning into joy&#44; &#38; comfort them &#38; gladden them &#91;&#63;&#93; their sorrow.<lb/></p>
