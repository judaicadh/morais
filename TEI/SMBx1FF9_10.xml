                Dear Friend<lb/></p>
                <p>For I trust you will permit<lb/> me thus to address you&#59; and although we have involuntarily<lb/> been opponents &#40;friendly of course&#41; in public on two occasions I<lb/> trust that you with me can see no reason why all should<lb/> not be friends in private.  It was from no insensibility that<lb/> I did not reply at once to your esteemed favor of 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ultimo&#59; but<lb/> when I tell you that your letter arrived here during my absence<lb/> on &#34;a trip matrimonial&#34; that I have now been only a month married<lb/> and in that itme have had perforce to continue a literary work<lb/> of mine &#40;The <sic>Sanatary</sic> Institutions of the Hebrews&#8212;you will<lb/> I am sure in the same spirit that dictated the words&#8212;&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> you will pronounce me &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  God forbid I should have any<lb/> unfriendly feeling to you because you were elected to the post I<lb/> aspired&#8212;I am not such a fool as to allow these disappointments<lb/> to become so impressed on my mind as to be injurious&#44; I believe<lb/> that &#91;Hebrew&#93; as well as &#91;Hebrew&#93; does surely &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Thank<lb/> God&#44; I am truly happy here&#8212;you will say&#44; you are yet a &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> and it would strange were it not so&#44; but I have always been<lb/> so for the 6 years I have been here.  My &#91;Hebrew&#93; are much attached<lb/> to me&#44; they do not think that even you&#44; nor any other &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> my equal&#44; and what more do I want than to see them<lb/> more faithful to their maker&#59; for this I earnestly pray &#38; strive.<lb/>  I am truly glad to hear that your ministry has been<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/> 
                <p>so far blessed that you have &#34;formed favor in the sight&#34; of<lb/> your &#91;Hebrew&#93; and that many who were formerly careless of spiritual<lb/> matters have now become interested therein.  May we both<lb/> receive the divine help guidance &#38; strength in the sacred<lb/> responsible positions we occupy.  May He regard our efforts<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; however humble&#44; with favor.<lb/></p>
                <p>I shall proceed with a little more about myself<lb/> to encourage you to write me a long letter about yourself<lb/> I hope you will be induced so to do.  I devote much of my<lb/> time to study &#38; to literary pursuits.  I am now publishing<lb/> a most powerfully &#38; logically written work defending<lb/> Jewish exposition &#38; dogmata&#8212;tho&#39; at the cost of Christianity&#8212;<lb/> entitled Grounds of Christianity Examined by Bethune English M. A.<lb/> the work is a most necessary one for our people in America.  I<lb/> republish it at the earnest solicitation of some members of my congregation<lb/> who have literally subscribed for the purpose.  Our mutual friend<lb/> Mr A Hart has subscribed handsomely and promised his countenance<lb/> I have added a very clever essay by way of appendix on the Talmud<lb/> &#38; the Gospels published by R Lipser in the Jewish Chronicle&#8212;and<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; have published the Essay in pamphlet form<lb/> at 25 cents.  Another work which I have in press is my own&#8212;it<lb/> is the 1st vol of my &#34;<sic>Sanatary</sic> Institutions of the Hebrews&#34;<lb/> designed to show in no unfavorable light the hygiene of<lb/> the Bible and Talmud.  I am about issuing a circular to the<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; soliciting their countenance to the first mentioned<lb/> work especially.  Many of our reverend colleagues of the United<lb/> States &#38; England have permitted me to announce in my circular their<lb/> names as being ready to receive names&#44; subscriptions &#38;c and I<lb/> need scarcely say I should be very glad were I permitted to<lb/> add your name&#44; for the same object.  Perhaps you would be<lb/> kind enough to let me know by return of mail if possible<lb/> as to your wishes on this subject.  <sic>Refering</sic> to a subject<lb/> before mentioned I feel glad to be able to say that Mr Hart<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/> 
                <p>was in some little error respecting your letter to me in<lb/> reply to that which I addressed to you on your arrival.  I<lb/> did receive your reply&#44; and simply stated my regret to Mr Hart<lb/> that I did not hear oftener from you&#59; as I can assure you<lb/> I should feel great pleasure in counting you among those &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> with whom I exchange thought in America by letter.  For<lb/> the present I close &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
                <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/>
                &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
                <p>Would it be too much to ask you<lb/> for a list of the seat holders &#38; members<lb/> of your &#91;Hebrew&#93; Perhaps your secretary<lb/> could read&#91;&#63;&#93; it.<lb/></p>
