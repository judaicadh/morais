            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Immutably beautiful is the eighth psalm of<lb/> David.  The inspired author rising his eyes heaven&#45;<lb/>&#45;ward&#44; and contemplating nature&#44; wonders that God&#44;<lb/> who commanded and the sky was studded with shi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ning lights&#59; who wished and worlds whirled<lb/> round the boundless space&#44; would deign to care<lb/> for man&#45;man&#44; a speck in the vastness of crea&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion.  But the psalmist marvels not<lb/> alone that God shows His goodness by taking know&#45;<lb/>&#45;ledge of man&#45;&#45;for all beings&#44; animate or inani&#45;<lb/>&#45;mate&#59; drive existence and maintenance from the power of the Almighty&#44;<lb/> but that man should have received faculties so<lb/> excellent as to render him only a little less than<lb/> angels &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Then David proceeds to describe in his glow&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing language those faculties by the exercise of<lb/> which man contrives discerns and discovers and invents<lb/> all means to place innumerable objects under<lb/> his control&#44; or&#44; to express it as in the text&#44; to be<lb/> &#34;crowned with glory and majesty&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Yes&#58; stupendous are the faculties of the mind&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>and verily they represent a very most noble part of<lb/> man&#39;s nature.  But only a part&#44; not the<lb/> whole nature of man.  The Sovereign Lord<lb/> who breathed into us spirituality&#45;&#45;intelligence&#45;&#45;<lb/>for high purposes of life&#44; has given us also feel&#45;<lb/>&#45;ings&#45;&#45;sentiments&#45;&#45;which constitute one half&#44; so to say&#44; of our<lb/> being.  It is right to value the former&#44; but<lb/> it is would be religiously wrong to despise the latter.<lb/>  And I will prove it.  The Bible which<lb/> ought to serve us as a guide&#44; appeals oftener<lb/> to our sentiments hearts than to our powers of reflection.<lb/>  It even lowers the Almighty down to our own<lb/> level&#44; in order to encourage in us loving&#45;kindness&#44;<lb/> compassion&#44; forgiveness.  Thus we read that<lb/> God is the Father of the fatherless&#44; that God<lb/> pleads the cause of the widow&#44; that He is slow<lb/> to anger and He abundantly pardons&#59; expressions evi&#45;<lb/>&#45;dently intended to strengthen our emotional nature&#44;<lb/> as the spring of virtues&#44; without which we<lb/> might be cold&#45;hearted philosophers&#44; but we could<lb/> never enjoy the sweet relationship of man<lb/> with his neighbor during this terrestrial journey.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Now&#44; brethren&#44; it is because we possess sen&#45;<lb/>&#45;timents&#44; that we sympathise with Mrs. H. W.<lb/> A.&#44; with her son and her daughter&#44; and all<lb/> who yearned after the creature of God coffined encased<lb/> within this chest.  It is because we who<lb/> knew him&#44; can recall the fond affection love he bes&#45;<lb/>&#45;towed upon those near to his heart&#44; that&#44; look&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing at this mortuary chest&#44; coffin we lament the de&#45;<lb/>cease of a fellow&#45;Israelite&#44; who&#44; humanly think reflect consider according to our<lb/> &#45;ing finite judgment&#44; might have lived long and enhanced<lb/> others&#39; happiness.  But far be it from any<lb/> of us to murmur&#44; and from me to dwell on<lb/> a single thought which might intensify grief.  I<lb/> stand here neither to draw forth sobs &#38; sighs&#44; nor<lb/> to laud &#38; panegyrize&#44; but to counsel and to pray.<lb/>  To the respected widow I will say&#58; Live to<lb/> appreciate the blessings still left for your<lb/> enjoyment&#44; and thank God that they remain<lb/> within your reach.  Many do hope that hose divine benedict&#45;<lb/>&#45;ions will be yours increasingly&#44; for a long series<lb/> of years.  To our young friend Os...and dear Fl.... I say&#58;<lb/> make the widowhood of her that gave you birth&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>free from every painful thought reflection&#44; so that in<lb/> her be fulfilled the sentence of the Scriptures&#59; for&#45;<lb/>&#45;mer troubles are forgotten&#44; they are not remembered<lb/> any more&#44; nor do they come up upon the mind&#44;<lb/> because of the present pleasures.  And my fervent<lb/> prayer is for H. W. A.  The Sages of Israel have<lb/> assured us that trials are the crucible in which<lb/> our soul is becomes purified tenfold.  May the spirit of our<lb/> brother&#44; disenthralled from the chastened body&#44;<lb/> brightened up in a heavenly sphere&#44; become<lb/> imparadised in the knowledge that those who<lb/> loved him here below&#44; cherish a memory of<lb/> early happy days which have gone&#44; that they firmly believe&#44; as they<lb/> believe in a God of Justice and truth&#44; that his<lb/> death on earth is life eternal among the<lb/> saints.  Oh&#33; may he who was filially du&#45;<lb/>&#45;tiful&#44; fraternally considerate&#44; conjugally<lb/> pure&#44; paternally affectionately be allotted<lb/> unalloyed joys as an Israelite a <sic>worshipper</sic> of the Unity&#44; and as a<lb/> man&#44; whom God made only a little less lower<lb/> than angels&#44; to be crowned with glory and majesty.<lb/></p>
