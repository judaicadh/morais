            <p>Philadelphia&#44; January 23&#44; 1877.<lb/></p>
            <p>Revr. Dr. B. Fesenthal.<lb/>
                Dear Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>Mr. Ignatz Bunreuther wrote me a letter some weeks ago&#44;<lb/> in which he stated&#44; that having heard through your means that I<lb/> could dispose of some of Luzzalto&#39;s works&#44; he was anxious to buy<lb/> as many as I had in my possession&#59; or words to that effect.  I<lb/> answered that I expected some books but I could not tell then<lb/> exactly how many would be sent.  Yet&#44; if after having sold those<lb/> which had been bespoken&#44; there were any left&#44; I would reserve them<lb/> for him.  I received very shortly after 5 copies of the Pentateuch&#44;<lb/> and 1 copy of Isaiah&#59; the latter and four of the former I delivered<lb/> to several of my colleagues here to whom I had promised them&#44; and<lb/> now I have 1 which I intended for yourself.  I fully appreciate&#44; I<lb/> can assure you&#44; the motive that induces you to deprive yourself<lb/> of an anticipated pleasure&#44; for not infrequently I have been placed<lb/> in a similar position&#59; but I consider it a duty to say&#44; that since<lb/> I addressed you last&#44; I found that 5 dollars or even 4.50 would pay for<lb/> those volumes.  In fact&#44; I have just returned some of the money I<lb/> had received for the price of Luzzalto&#39;s writings&#44; because I asked<lb/> too much&#44; while laboring under a misapprehension.  Now if you wish<lb/> that I keep the <sic>Tentateuch</sic> for you&#44; say so&#44; and I will retain it till<lb/> you feel disposed to send for it or to direct how I can forward it.<lb/>  If you do not&#44; have the kindness to see Mr. Bunreuther&#44; and explain<lb/> matters to the gentleman&#44; mentioning what you know about our cor&#45;<lb/>respondence&#44; and of the desire he had strongly expressed.  Should<lb/> he be of the same mind&#44; I would forthwith let him have the copy<lb/> still remaining.<lb/></p>
            <p>For the present it would be quite useless I should address<lb/> the other gentleman you name in your kind favor.  I don&#39;t remember<lb/> whether I mentioned in my last that I suggested to the Luzzalto family<lb/> to republish the productions of the Savant without the Italian version&#44;<lb/> for this is little understood outside of my country.  If they agree&#44;<lb/> as they intimate in the catalogue&#44; which I hope came to hand&#44; the sale<lb/> will be more extensive and less expensive will be both the Pentateuch<lb/> and the comment on Isaiah.  Allow me to thank you for your remark<lb/> regarding Haritba.  I shall rectify the error&#44; in another note&#44; but<lb/> I would feel greatly obliged&#44; if you could inform me on what your<lb/> surmise is based.  You were correct in guessing&#44; that I drew my<lb/> knowledge from Azalii&#44; as he writes in Shem Haggedohm.<lb/></p>
            <p>In great haste&#44;<lb/>
                Yours very truly&#44;<lb/>
                S. Morais.<lb/></p>
