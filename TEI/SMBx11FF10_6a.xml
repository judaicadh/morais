            <p>Brethren&#33;  Let those who desire to be shown a striking illustra&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of life the uncertainty of life&#44; gaze upon this coffin.<lb/>  The mortal remains encased therein&#44; are not those of a man&#44;<lb/> bent down with years&#59; nor those of one whose bodily infirmi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ties betoken an early dissolution.  When the Angels<lb/> of death summoned Isaac E. Hackenburg to the tribunal<lb/> of the Great Judge&#44; he was in the most vigorous stage of<lb/> human existence.  Free from distempers premonitory of<lb/> an approaching end&#44; he anticipated&#44; no doubt&#44; a long enjoyment<lb/> of earthly delights.  He naturally conceived that he would<lb/> still be suffered to strive after the preferments and<lb/> honors which the world bestows............<lb/> O Ye&#44; thoughtless youths&#33; that rely upon your own strength&#44;<lb/> for the compassing of your schemes&#33; O ye all&#44; that are<lb/> whirled away in the mad dance of life&#44; pause<lb/> and an instant and reflect.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Why such haste to gather chaff&#44; which a puff of wind<lb/> drives away&#63;  Why will you bow at the shrine of idols of<lb/> gold and silver&#44; and forget Him&#44; whom you owe infinite<lb/> thanks for every breath you draw&#63;  Had He in His bound&#45;<lb/>&#45;less goodness destined you even to outlive the period allotted<lb/> to man&#44; you would still look back upon the years that<lb/> sunk into eternity&#44; as on a passing shadow.  But&#44; what&#44;<lb/> if your terrestrial pilgrimage were suddenly to terminate&#44; ere<lb/> one half of it was accomplished&#63;  What&#44; if like our lament&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed brother&#44; you were to be cut off unawares&#63;  Think&#44; my<lb/> friends&#44; and take the admonition of the ancient moralist to<lb/> heart &#34;Remember your Creator in the days of your youth&#44; before<lb/> the evil time arriveth&#34;......&#34;When man goeth to his long<lb/> home&#44; and the mourners walk around in the streets&#34; Or&#44;<lb/> rather&#44; as the Teachers of Israel recommend&#44; with equal solicitude&#44;<lb/> &#34;Repent one day before your death.  Human<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>wisdom and foresight cannot descry the approaching<lb/> of that sword which severs the mortal from the immortal&#59; be<lb/> therefore prepared always to meet the issue&#44; through a life<lb/> consonant with the rules of morality and religion.<lb/>  In many respects the deportment of our deceased brother&#44; during<lb/> his short career&#44; may well serve to you as a patter worthy<lb/> of imitation.  His filial reverence&#59; the lively interest he<lb/> evinced in the welfare of his needy fellow believers&#59;<lb/> his desire for mental and spiritual improvement&#59; his<lb/> love for Judaism&#44; in the abstract&#59; and the estimation in<lb/> which he held those he sincerely deemed the best exponents<lb/> thereof&#44; were his prominent and commendable characteristics.<lb/>  That his mind misjudged&#44; and that he failed to carry<lb/> out the last injunction of his righteous parent&#44; was more<lb/> the effect of circumstances than a wilful perversion of<lb/> the heart.  A long absence from a home&#44; where piety reigned&#59;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>and too close a contact with individuals&#44; who would arrogantly<lb/> cause their new&#45;fangled notions to supersede the word of God&#44;<lb/> estranged him somewhat from the time&#45;honored practices of Israel.  His mind<lb/> became unfortunately tinctured with doctrines&#44; now seized upon with avidity<lb/> by the unwary among our coreligionists.  But had a longer existence been<lb/> vouchsafed to him&#44; I have reasons to believe&#44; that he would have fully<lb/> discovered his error&#44; and shaped his conduct after the model exhibited<lb/> by the Sages of our people.  Oh&#33; may He whose inscrutable decree<lb/> called him hence&#44; forgive the trespasses of the son for the sake of the merits<lb/> acquired by his sainted father.  May He whose highest attribute is<lb/> mercy&#44; regard only the virtues that adorned our lamented brother.<lb/>  May the fervent prayers of those he left upon earth to bemoan his<lb/> untimely loss&#44; propitiate for him the favor of the Almighty&#44; and<lb/> gain for his soul a seat among the blessed&#44; and a durable glory.<lb/>  &#34;May he go in peace&#59; may he rest on his lasting couch&#44; as he that hath<lb/> walked uprightly before God.&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
