            <p>a funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>Kind friends&#33;  Have you come to mourn for the dead&#63;<lb/>  stand then I pray you aside.  Let not your sobbing be<lb/> heard.  Let not your tears flow in the presence of the<lb/> bereaved.  Why add to a sorrow&#44; overwhelming&#44; crushing&#63;<lb/>  This unhappy mother has rank almost to the dregs the<lb/> cup of affliction.  She needs a drop of sweetness&#44; which<lb/> may temper its bitter&#44; bitter taste.  Miriam the virtuous<lb/> wife of the man she had loved from childhood.  Miriam<lb/> the unsurpassingly industrious&#44; yet the gentle hearted&#44; the<lb/> considerate&#44; the dutiful daughter&#44; diverted at times the<lb/> mind of her surviving parent from the grievous past&#44;<lb/> and he enlivened it with the bright anticipations of the<lb/> future.  But a blight has fallen on his hopes.<lb/>  This disconsolate husband walked steadily in the light<lb/> that issued from his cherished home.  Suddenly<lb/> darkness compassed him around.  Oh&#33; for a ray which<lb/> may guide his footsteps&#33;  The face whose smile<lb/> urged him in to duty has lost its radiance.<lb/>  That must e indeed a heart of flint&#44; when doe snot now<lb/> yearn towards you with the deepest sympathy.  For&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>even the stones of the sacred altar&#44; write our Sages&#44; weep<lb/> because of him&#44; who buried the wife of his youth.  Miriam<lb/> was emphatically so.  Nay more&#59; she was the woman&#44;<lb/> whose abiding affection for you grew with her growth.<lb/>  Speak not to History is not barren of instances in<lb/> which the sentiments mutually entertained in the spring<lb/> of life&#44; lose in intensity as time leaves its traces upon our<lb/> visage.  Our own experience might point out cases illustra&#45;<lb/>&#45;tive of the sad fact that lovers have outlived their love.<lb/>  But this sainted daughter of my people nourished a flame<lb/> pure&#44; inextinguishable.  Speak not to me of the<lb/> happiness attending wealth Miriam Levy&#45;&#45;without riches&#45;&#45;<lb/>enjoyed that blessing.  The dwelling of luxury cannot offer<lb/> greater domestic delights than an humble abode afforded&#44; during<lb/> mine consecutive years&#44; my lamented friend.  For&#44; she who<lb/> was the moving spirit&#44; exhibited so perfect a capacity to<lb/> adapt the means to the end&#59; so exceeding a degree of thriftiness&#44;<lb/> so much forethought&#44; and amiability&#44; that I do not over&#45;<lb/>&#45;draw the picture&#44; when I apply to her the praise bestowed by<lb/> the moralist of yore upon the virtuous Hebrew wife.  &#34;The heart<lb/> of her husband did safely trust in her&#44; and he saw not his gain<lb/> diminish.  She did him good and not evil&#44; all the days of her<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>life.  For&#44; she girded her loins with strength&#44; aye&#58; she strengthened<lb/> her own arms.  She looked well to the ways of her household&#44; and<lb/> ate not the bread of idleness.&#34;  Alas&#33; that the exemplary<lb/> wife&#44; the fond mother&#44; the respectful daughter&#44; the kind<lb/> friend is gone.  She has gone to her lasting reward&#45;&#45;and who<lb/> more deserving of a halo round the sainted brow&#63;&#45;&#45;But<lb/> you my innocent little creatures&#44; you&#44; deprived of her direction&#44;<lb/> and her counsel&#44; will you rise hereafter and do her honor&#63;....<lb/> Who will shapen your course after the model she has left&#63;<lb/>  Dear relatives of the deceased&#33;  The sound of her voice strikes yet<lb/> on your ears.  When Miriam saw Death beckoning to her<lb/> to follow&#44; her faint lips moved.  She spoke words of love<lb/> for you all.  She invoked the God&#44; whom she had faithfully<lb/> served&#44; to shower down upon you enduring blessings.  But<lb/> more than she could utter&#44; did she silently prayed for with<lb/> her departing breath.  I am now the interpreter of that<lb/> thought of a dying mother.  She would that the five<lb/> whom she nestled in her breast&#44; might be tenderly cared<lb/> for.  She would that you vie with each other in striving to<lb/> lighten the weight of their misfortune&#59; to aid their father&#44;<lb/> bound to labor <sic>indefetagably</sic> for their support&#44; in rearing the&#45;<lb/>&#45;m she anxiously desired that they might be educated.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>A firm believer in the religion of Israel&#44; she would that<lb/> their surroundings impress them with reverence for the tenets<lb/> and precepts entrusted to our guardianship.  She would that<lb/> your example bring them nigh to the fountain of consolation&#44;<lb/> the Lord God.  In a word&#58; she would that the virtues she<lb/> highly possessed be engrafted on their tender souls.<lb/></p>
            <p>Could my lamented friend speak but once more&#44; you would hear<lb/> this appeal &#34;Husband&#44; mother&#44; people of my kin&#44; and<lb/> my own blood.  Let those to whom I have given birth&#44; learn<lb/> to do good.  When my sons shall have become conspicuous<lb/> for their uprightness and their piety&#59; when my daughter shall<lb/> be noted for her virtues&#44; then you will have proved that you held<lb/> your Miriam in sacred remembrance&#44; as she sought at your<lb/> hands.  Promise my friends ever her mortal<lb/> remains that you will <sic>fulfil</sic> her unexpressed but deeply&#45;felt<lb/> wish.  That for her sake&#44; you will study your every action&#44; your<lb/> words&#44; that her dear ones may imbibe only what is good holy&#44; just<lb/> and true.  Promise that you will with a sweet accord of<lb/> sentiments labor to give the bodily health&#44; and the moral conduct<lb/> of these innocent beings a sound and stable foundation.<lb/>  And may God assist you in so noble a task.  May He who wounds but also heals&#44; bind up your bleeding hearts<lb/> as He can divinely accomplish.  May He chase away the sadness<lb/> resting upon your countenances.  May He grant that the performance of a high duty&#44;<lb/> &#38; the joy of its successful issue&#44; may all reconcile you to the untimely call from earth if one so lovely<lb/> so pure &#38; so exemplary.<lb/></p>
