            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>If it lay in my power&#44; not a tear drawn by grief<lb/> would be shed over the remains of this son of our race.<lb/>  For he lived long and to a noble purpose.  God from<lb/> whom we receive the air we breathe and the blood which courses our viens&#44; and quickens and warms our being granted to my vene&#45;<lb/>&#45;rable friend an almost a score of years over the time allot&#45;<lb/>&#45;ted to His earthly creatures&#44; so that he might teach us all who<lb/> knew him well the heroism of faith.  Few more<lb/> severely sorely tried than Dr Emanuel&#44; but few more firm unshaken&#44;<lb/> more vigorous in grappling with such trials as threatened to<lb/> undermine a belief in the justice of the Supreme.<lb/></p>
                <p>I did not know enjoy the acquaintance of this good Israelite while fortune smiled<lb/> upon his household&#59; while&#44; in the language of the Shemanite<lb/> of old the Scriptures&#44; he could say that he looked over his habitation<lb/> and missed nothing&#44; but I saw him often since<lb/> prosperity fled&#44; and clouds of domestic afflictions<lb/> gathered thick round his dwelling&#45;place.  I saw<lb/> him then and learnt that he gathered derived strength from<lb/> the conviction that as gold is purified refined in crucial heat<lb/> so is the human spirit cleansed of its dross by suf&#45;<lb/>&#45;fering&#44; and so it is fitted for a higher development&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>when freed from the perishable body.<lb/></p>
            <p>I will seal my lips not to utter a word as to the<lb/> character of my friends&#39; suffering.  Too sacred are home domestic<lb/> sorrows to be set out to the gaze of strangers&#44; but<lb/> I must point out the source whence the balm was<lb/> procured&#44; that others may seek it and find it.<lb/>  Dr Emanuel derived drew a restorative from that religion<lb/> which tells us that not the loftiest in the social<lb/> ladder will always reach up the mountain of the Lord&#59; most not<lb/> the most successful will gain have earned a seat in God&#39;s holy<lb/> temple&#44; but he who is clean of hands and pure<lb/> of heart&#44; who does not lift up his soul to vanity<lb/> nor swear allegiance to falsehood.  He will receive<lb/> a blessing from the Eternal&#44; and beneficence from the<lb/> His saving only God of salvation.  Therefore Thus impressed my friend<lb/> continued pure unstained remained kept unsullied therefore unsullied&#44; and rose to the heights where<lb/> a new life begins&#59; a new life born to blissfulness.<lb/>  He now thanks now His Maker for that nature steeled<lb/> in faith&#44; which enabled him to overcome the dif&#45;<lb/>&#45;ficulties besetting the path of righteousness he<lb/> had determined to follow to the end.  The struggle is over&#44;<lb/> the victory is won&#44; why should the sound of<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>weeping disturb this solemn hour&#44; when even<lb/> what is perishable destructible is honorably to be laid on<lb/> its final bed&#63;  Let rather the glories of Israel&#39;s<lb/> King be rehearsed&#44; and praises be given to His faith&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful servant.<lb/></p>
            <p>Yet I turn and rest my eye upon an object who that<lb/> has cause to deeply to lament&#44; who that has every claim to<lb/> our sympathies.  My friend&#39;s life&#45;companion&#44; she<lb/> who has indeed shared his sorrows and bereavements losses&#44; not<lb/> less than his former pleasures and his gains.  She who watched<lb/> over the preservation of his health with the indescrib&#45;<lb/>&#45;able anxiety that a miser watches over the treasures heaps of gold he<lb/> has garnered up.  The mother of his numerous family&#44;<lb/> his aged wife&#44; feels cannot hold back poignant grief because of<lb/> a death which deprives her of the dearest and truest sweetest<lb/> treasure.  I may remind her of the circumstance<lb/> that eighty six years is a long continuance here below&#59;<lb/> I may describe to her the half a century&#44; and even a more longer<lb/> period of connubial love&#44; enjoyed which is not given to<lb/> all to ey enjoy&#44; I may show the respect paid to the<lb/> memory of her sainted husband&#59; picture the reward set apart<lb/> for the good and thus endeavour to soothe her pains.  Her her mind will would appreciate my utterances&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>but the heart will not be still refuse consolation.  I shall not<lb/> attempt to check the instincts of our best sensitive nature.<lb/>  The Sages who understood it perfectly&#44; recommended<lb/> not to try to force a forgetfulness of one&#39;s bereave&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment&#44; when the dead lie enshrouded before the<lb/> survivors.  Weep and sigh thou then you that have been left<lb/> desolate&#44; and may the vent given to you pent up grief sorrow<lb/> bring now relief as your faith will prove your stay till you join the beloved one that has preceded you to the land of spirits.  But I must improve the melancholy<lb/> event by delivering my charge to your children offspring&#44;<lb/>  sons and daughters children of Dr Emanuel.  The God of Sinai<lb/> who&#44; on delivering enunciating His Decalogue&#44; attached connected a reward<lb/> only to with the fifth commandment&#44; bids me to say that<lb/> length of days and happiness await your future<lb/> conduct.  The past is will be buried with the sorely tried<lb/> being soon to be taken to yonder cemetery grave cemetery.  The merits<lb/> of the departed will atone for all filial shortcomings&#44;<lb/> and the continuance on the resuming of unswerving dutifulness<lb/> towards a widowed mother&#44; will open to you the<lb/> gates of divine favor and prosperity.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;Here follows an earnest exhortation&#41;.<lb/></p>
