            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren.  Occasions have often arisen during my<lb/> official ministration&#44; upon which I regretted my<lb/> ignorance of the language familiar to a vast<lb/> majority of my fellow&#45;believers in America&#44; but<lb/> never have I lamented it more deeply than when<lb/> I heard of the decease of Mrs H....  For if words<lb/> of sympathy&#44; can allay sorrow&#44; they should be<lb/> spoken now mainly to him whose anguish is<lb/> the keenest&#44; because his loss is soul&#45;tearing&#44; soul&#45;desolating.<lb/>  Far be it from me to intimate that the children<lb/> of the venerable departed do not grieve over this<lb/> earthly separation.  They doubtless feel it with intensity<lb/> of pain&#44; and they would have considered no sacrifice<lb/> too great&#44; had it been in their power to keep hold<lb/> longer in their midst the dear being who gave them birth and boundless<lb/> affection.  They surely deplore the inability of human efforts to keep yet<lb/> alive their mother&#45;&#45;though aged&#45;&#45;yet for another<lb/> series of years&#44; but the distress they experience will<lb/> be lessened as time rolls on in the bestowal of love<lb/> on other objects nigh to them in their sweet re&#45;<lb/>&#45;lations of life&#44; relations of husbands&#44; wives and<lb/> parents&#44; which they have severally contracted.<lb/>  It is so Divinely ordained &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>&#34;By a heavenly dispensation&#44; the memory of<lb/> the dead is gradually removed from the mind.&#34;  But my<lb/> friend Dr. H...will not find the same outlet<lb/> to his affliction.  The woman he wedded in his the buoyancy of<lb/> youth&#44; and the woman in whose constant companionship he<lb/> spent more than half a century&#59; the woman<lb/> whose association assuaged the pangs of bereave&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments he has frequently sustained&#44; was essential<lb/> to his existence.  He absolutely needed her patient care&#44; her<lb/> provident attention&#44; her kind&#44; connubial tender&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness.  Therefore is another sentence of Israel&#39;s<lb/> sages applicable to him &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;A man who becries the wife he first married &#91;&#63;&#93; choice&#44;<lb/> has naught but darkness to face.&#34;  It will<lb/> be then easily understood why I had eagerly wished<lb/> that it lay within reach of my capacity to address<lb/> Dr Heller at this hour&#44; in a language which he best<lb/> comprehends.  He is the greatest deepest chief mourner here&#44;<lb/> and to him expressions of condolence and fellow&#45;<lb/>feelings fittingly set forth might prove of some comfort.  Still&#44;<lb/> after all the affect of my speech might be<lb/> short lived very precarious.  When the heart is torn cut asunder&#44; such appliances<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>must be resorted to as will stop check the flow<lb/> of blood.  Actions will do it&#44; and who should<lb/> perform them&#44; if not the sons and daughters of<lb/> my friend&#63;  They cannot bring about a perfect<lb/> healing.  Too deep is the wound&#44; and age makes<lb/> it sorer&#44; but they can soften the pain.  Without<lb/> neglecting duties which are also very sacred&#44; they<lb/> can devote their joint thoughts to the righteous task<lb/> of mitigating the suffering endured by their bereaved<lb/> father.  They will&#44; I trust&#44; advise together how<lb/> to render an irreparable loss less grievous&#44;<lb/> how to cause the decaying years of my friend to glide<lb/> away tranquilly&#44; if not joyfully.  I know that it<lb/> scarcely becomes me&#44; who cannot claim the right of<lb/> spiritual stewardship over them&#44; to exhort&#59; but as an<lb/> interpreter of God&#39;s will&#44; enunciated in the fifth com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mandment of the Decalogue&#44; I beg of Dr H&#39;s child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren to bear with him in his practices and in his<lb/> preferences&#44; however they stray widely their mode of thinking<lb/> may differ in matters pertaining to ritual religion.<lb/>  By thus honoring their father&#44; they will show filial<lb/> reverence to the memory of their mother.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>For&#44; judging from a slight acquaintance&#44; I<lb/> have reasons to believe that short she would have so enjoying enjoined<lb/> upon her sons and daughters.  Gentle she appeared<lb/> and of a yielding disposition to promote peace.  To the<lb/> virtues which so adorn a woman&#45;&#45;industry and retiring<lb/> habits&#44; I am assured that she added loving&#45;kindness and<lb/> forbearance.  None can supply her place to the position<lb/> she held in her husband&#39;s heart&#44; but her offspring must<lb/> endeavour to make her absence bearable by means of un&#45;<lb/>&#45;remitting filial devotion.  That They will I am certain&#44;<lb/> and because by reason of it I am directed from on high to ensure<lb/> to them happiness here and hereafter &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Everlasting God&#33;  Let Thy Sinaic promises be fulfilled<lb/> in the children of Thy handmaid J. H. as a recompense for their demeanour.  May they become<lb/> a tower of strength to their father&#44; now physically and moral&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly weakened down by afflictions.  Let them see and feel<lb/> their reward in the restoration of calmness and in<lb/> that of health in one still diseased and seeking Thy celestial<lb/> assistance.  May the satisfaction of having fulfilled Thy<lb/> ordinance be accompanied with the blessing of a prosperous ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;istence.  And for the sake of her&#44; whose spirits stands now at the bar of<lb/> Thy justice&#44; I beseech Thee O Lord&#33; May the accusations of sin be silenced&#44; and the<lb/> pleading of womanly virtues win for her soul acquittal and pardon&#44; and<lb/> a lofty station where bliss is enthroned for ever more.  Amen.<lb/></p>
