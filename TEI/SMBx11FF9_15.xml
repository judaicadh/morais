            <p>A funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>Often have I occasion to feel&#44; how unequal to the requirements of a<lb/> messenger of God&#44; are my capacities.  But at no time does the knowledge<lb/> of my deficiencies&#44; so disconcert my thoughts&#44; as when I stand beside<lb/> the dead&#44; and look upon the face of the mourners.  For&#44; it is<lb/> indeed then that the voice of religion&#44; ought to be efficaciously heard&#44;<lb/> through the mouth of its servants.  It is then that the hope in<lb/> immortality ought to be breathed into the souls that grieve.<lb/>  It is then&#44; amid the prevailing gloom&#44; that the light of faith&#44; should<lb/> be made to irradiate all minds.  Oh&#33; were I endowed with that<lb/> power&#44; so essential to the character with which I am invested&#44; I would<lb/> transform this funeral pall&#44; before your vision&#44; into a crown of<lb/> celestial glories.  I would let none of you&#44; my sorrowing friends&#44;<lb/> depart hence but strengthened&#44; comforted&#59; with a blessing to an<lb/> all&#45;wise Providence&#44; lingering on the lips.  But I cannot<lb/> thus inspire your minds.  Weak in intellect&#44; and bound to the<lb/> earth&#44; I cannot uplift you above this sorrowful scene to contem&#45;<lb/>&#45;plate joys serenely pure.  For&#44; I have but eyes to weep with<lb/> the mourner bereaved&#44; a heart that can only respond to the moaning of<lb/> a sorely afflicted family in Israel.<lb/></p> 
            <p>After a short absence&#44; the father had returned to his home&#59;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>that home&#44; precious to his heart&#44; for it held the woman he loved&#45;&#45;a devoted<lb/> wife&#59; children taught to reverence God&#44; and honor their parents.  How<lb/> happy that reunion&#33;  The sabbath was sacredly spent...on the<lb/> morrow&#44; ere he could give his nearest and dearest a parting kiss&#44; Lewis<lb/> M. Allen had breathed his last.  May God be your stay in<lb/> this <sic>woful</sic> calamity&#44; O daughter of my people&#33;  The symapthies<lb/> of a whole community are awakened.  Many man would fain approach<lb/> you with words of comfort.  But what can the most gifted of men<lb/> say which that will assuage a sorrow so deep&#44; as that into which<lb/> you have been suddenly plunged&#63;  But God can and will<lb/> uphold you in this saddest of trials.  He will hasten to your help.<lb/>  See&#33;  He has already anticipated a healing to the wound.  He<lb/> has opened within your breast&#44; a fountain supplying the living<lb/> water of consolation&#44; even&#44; the steadfastness of your religious convic&#45;<lb/>&#45;tions.  Like the confiding Psalmist you exclaim &#34;Thou will not<lb/> suffer thy pious one to see corruption&#34;......In Thy presence is fulness<lb/> of joy&#59; at Thy right&#45;hand pleasures are for evermore.&#34;  The<lb/> image of the dear husband torn away form your bosom embrace&#44; will ever<lb/> stand present before your vision&#44; not to terrify the mind&#44; but<lb/> to incite it to unabated exertions.  To add to your alacrity in<lb/> the discharge of domestic obligations&#44; so that what death has rendered<lb/> incomplete&#44; will be fully accomplished by your maternal care solicitude.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Dear Lewis&#45;&#45;the first born son of those&#44; whose plighted love will<lb/> survive the grave.  My friend and pupil.  The memory of your<lb/> deceased father&#44; is the mirror upon which you must steadily gaze.<lb/>  You will then continue to be subm <sic>filially</sic> submissive&#44; filially duti&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful.  The disposition for good&#44; which your conduct exhibits&#44; formed a<lb/> source of gratification to the author of your life.  He dwelt upon it&#44; one<lb/> night of last summer&#44; when picturing to me the blessings surrounding<lb/> the family hearth.  In you&#44; already grown a youth&#44; he foresaw<lb/> the unfolding of a character right for virtues.  Let your<lb/> widowed mother gather and enjoy the fruits of your parents early planting.<lb/>  With singleness of purpose&#44; let her comfort be henceforth your mainstay.<lb/>  Clarence&#44; your younger brother&#44; will be drawn still more closely in<lb/> affection to her that gave him birth&#44; when you will show how her hap&#45;<lb/>&#45;piness is the highest of your ambition.  And you cherished daugh&#45;<lb/>&#45;ters of my departed friend&#44; Fanny and Amelia and Anna.  Let your innocent hearts<lb/> be entwined round your mother&#39;s heart.  Let them beat in unison of feelings.<lb/>  She needs all the strength&#44; that your attachment g can give.  With it&#44;<lb/> the burden of her sorrows&#44; will be greatly lightened.  When the remembrance<lb/> of a loss that cannot be returned&#44; will overshadow her spirits&#44; your tokens of<lb/> devotion&#44; your anxious care for her tranquility&#44; will <sic>dispell</sic> the gloom.<lb/>  Sweet Rosely&#44; whose voice was music to her father&#39;s ears&#44; will yet press<lb/> in her tiny hands&#44; her mother&#39;s visage&#44; and wipe the unbidden tear.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Each of you&#44; the relatives of Lewis M. Allen&#44; must offer his widow<lb/> an arm whereupon to lean for support&#59; a heart overflowing with the<lb/> tenderest of human emotions.  And you also&#44; exemplary sons&#44;<lb/> whose reverence for their pa maternal parent&#44; lengthened her days&#44;<lb/> despite severe trials&#44; comfort my friend&#44; Mistress Anna Allen.<lb/>  Her eldest child&#44; through whom the name of an ever lamented hus&#45;<lb/>&#45;band was perpetuated&#44; has likewise left her on the shores of this<lb/> stormy life.  Double your efforts&#44; that she may not sink into despair.<lb/>  Your manly deeds will be her deliverance.  She will&#44; under Providence&#44;<lb/> survive even the staggering blow&#44; and your wonted devotion will cheer<lb/> the writer of her existence.  But we all&#44; my dear<lb/> hearers&#33; should heed the lesson which this coffin solemnly imparts.<lb/>  We are not certain that the next moment will see us among the<lb/> living.  Let us while together&#44; abide in peace&#44; as it behooves the creatures<lb/> of the same God.  Extend to each other the hand of fellowship.  Labor&#44;<lb/> while traveling through this valley of death vale of tears&#44; to smooth the roughness raggedness of the path&#44;<lb/> over which we must inevitably pass.  Pride will set us apart.<lb/>  Hatred will raise between us a wall of separation.  But let us bury<lb/> our haughtiness&#44; before our bodies be consigned to the earth.  Let our<lb/> animosities be scattered to the wind&#44; ere our flesh and bones&#44; moulder away.<lb/>  Let us carry with us to our long home&#44; a spirit undefiled&#44; a soul that<lb/> has approached God&#44; by following truth&#44; justice and mercy&#44; toward the<lb/> holy attributes which whose practice will beatify the dead and quicken the dead.<lb/></p>
