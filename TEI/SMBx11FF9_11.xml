            <p>Funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>How shall I&#44; my mourning friends&#33; bind up your lacerated hearts&#63;<lb/>  Where is the balm with which I may heal your bleeding<lb/> wounds&#63;  If the reflection that many are now sorrowing<lb/> over your loss&#44; affords you relief&#44; count me among such.<lb/>  Believe that my sympathies are deeply stirred up&#44; and your<lb/> wailings moves me to tears.  Yes&#44; father and mother<lb/> of this dear child&#44; your the grief you experience is shared by others&#44; and this<lb/> thought ought to should lighten the burden which presses heavily<lb/> upon your spirits.  In the hour of bereavement&#44; when all<lb/> grows dismal &#38; dreary and gloomy before our vision&#44; the condolence of<lb/> sincere friends kindles within us the breast a ray of comfort.  It is&#44;<lb/> consoling to human beings to feel that they are not left<lb/> to pine away in utter solitude&#44; unthought of and uncared for&#44;<lb/> but that their misery excites commiseration&#59; that to allay<lb/> their pains is the endeavours of some tender kindred souls.<lb/>  Happy you Mr and Mistress Loeb even in the present mis&#45;<lb/>&#45;fortune&#59; happy&#44; that you are surrounded by a number<lb/> of tried friends&#44; but specially by loving relatives&#44; whose<lb/> unbounded kindness will indeed prove to you a soothing<lb/> balm restorative.  For the affection you bore little Clarence&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>scarcely surpassed that which they entertained&#44; and<lb/> to avert from him the sad fate he met with&#44; no sacrifice<lb/> would they have deemed too great.  You&#44; his parents&#44;<lb/> sunk into the depth of affliction&#44; at the tidings knowledge that death<lb/> had so suddenly and so violently snatched away from your<lb/> bosoms a darling son.  Can a mother be but seized with<lb/> anguish when&#44; returning home after a very short absence&#44;<lb/> she finds the child she left full of health and liveliness&#44; pass<lb/>&#45;ing away rapidly away from earth&#63;  Can a father&#44; at a distance<lb/> from those he cherished&#44; be but filled with woe and dismay at the tidings<lb/> that the child he hoped soon again to clasp in his arms&#44;<lb/> is about to be consigned to the grave&#63;  Yet But&#44; the pangs which<lb/> the grand&#45;parents of dear Clarence endured at the sight of<lb/> his mangled body&#44; exceeded all sufferings.  Yet&#44; But<lb/> when this paroxysm of distress shall have abated&#44; their efforts<lb/> will procure you my friend calm and consolation.  You will not<lb/> forget your the precious loss sustained&#59; for&#44; that would be impossible&#44;<lb/> unnatural&#59; but you will learn the better to appreciate<lb/> the blessings still within your reach&#44; and&#44; I hope trust&#44; you<lb/> will be also instructed by the melancholy past&#44; and act<lb/> wisely in the future.  Oh&#33; my bereaved friends&#33; sad mournful as the<lb/> present occasion assuredly is&#44; I think I would be derelict<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>in my official duties&#44; did I not strive to improve<lb/> it by a few words of a well&#45;meant advice.<lb/>  Perhaps&#44; the intensity of your love has&#44; humanly speaking&#44; wrought<lb/> this misfortune.  Clarence&#39;s winning ways&#44; may have<lb/> prevented your imbibing curbing a disposition too vivacious.<lb/>  The fear of inflicting even a momentary pain may have<lb/> induced you to let self&#45;will go unrestrained.  If so&#44; you<lb/> now doubtless deprecate a weakness&#44; often attending our parental feelings&#44;<lb/> a weakness&#44; which&#44; alas&#33; in your case proved so fatal<lb/> on Thursday last&#44; when a passing vehicle robbed you of carried away from you hence a<lb/> dear life.  But&#44; my friends&#33; to lament over our shortcomings&#44;<lb/> is idle&#44; unless it be the means of correcting what has been<lb/> defective in our conduct.  The Almighty has yet left<lb/> to your care two more lives.  Study their inclinations closely&#44;<lb/> and train them accordingly.  Bestow upon the same<lb/> the tenderest thoughts&#44; but be chary&#44; lest your attach&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment betray a wavering between parental obligations&#44;<lb/> and the gratifying of a child&#39;s whims.  You know<lb/> well your responsibility to the Lord of all flesh.  The son<lb/> of whose caresses death has deprived you&#44; has returned<lb/> to his Creator unpolluted.  Too young to have been<lb/> tainted with evil habits.  The virtuous instincts of his<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>soul will develop in a better world.  But you see that<lb/> his surviving brother and sister&#44; receive such an education<lb/> at your hands&#44; which may&#44; under Providence&#44; gain secure for<lb/> them an existence here below long enjoyed in the exercise<lb/> of righteousness.  And when you shall be called<lb/> hence&#44; their demeanour will attest before the great<lb/> Judge your a strict conformance in your part with His Divine directions&#44;<lb/> and you will meet again this little angel in<lb/> the land of spirits.  And now let your hearts<lb/> respond to the prayer I shall offer y for your consolation<lb/> and happiness.<lb/>  a prayer followed.<lb/></p>
