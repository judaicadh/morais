            <p>To the Revd Dr I M Wise&#44; Editor of the American Israelite<lb/>
            Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p><sic>Your</sic> shocked my feelings.  I had been warmly led up to the heights your mind ascended up.<lb/>  Lively were the surroundings&#44; and the view presented &#91;&#63;&#93; a kindly &#91;&#63;&#93;.  Why did you<lb/> force me thence into a slough&#63;  Pardon&#44; when I say that your description of &#34;a storm in a glass of<lb/> water&#34; following immediately the teaching inculcated in the dedication&#45;sermon at Pottsville Pa&#44; must jar<lb/> on&#47;<del>against</del> <sic>on</sic> one&#39;s sensibilities.  Can he who has just stood &#91;&#63;&#93; as the exponent of the purest principles of religion &#38; &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> have fallen back to gather mere bespatter with it those he deems his opponents&#63;  Alas&#33; that the &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> you pointed to hideously in the colors borrowed from the Talmud&#44; took revenge by seizing upon your hurt<lb/> unawares.  But however startled I may have been at the hidden transition from a theoretical lesson<lb/> of human goodness&#44; to a practice of an opposite nature&#44; I would not have let my voice be heard&#44; had<lb/> you not added confusion to my chagrin.  May I ask that you will explain what I am unable to<lb/> understand &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;Inserted&#58; Torah hec velimod ani tzurich&#93;.  What you term a &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;Inserted&#58; &#34;Minhag Kashut&#34;&#93; means&#44; I suppose&#44; a usage<lb/> universally adopted &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;Inserted&#58; Minhag shemittsashat bechod Israel&#93;&#44; and when&#44; according to Rabinnical dicta becomes a law.<lb/>  Can the introduction of an organ&#44; of a mixed  choir&#44; and of family pews in <hi rend="underline">the synagogue</hi>&#44; be&#44;<lb/> in all truth&#44; regarded as such&#63;  Conceding to you and the Jewish Ministers of the school you<lb/> represent&#44; the right assumed to labor for the establishing of customs entirely novel in Judaism.  Please&#44;<lb/> correct me if I am at fault&#44; but the limited knowledge I have of our history and theology induces to so to<lb/> style what you advocate.  Conceding that you really were&#44; as you claim&#44; the first Sages in this country&#44;<lb/> the Rab and Shemuel&#91;&#63;&#93; of America&#45;&#45;&#44; and that by virtue of the authority received&#44; you could effect a<lb/> remodelling of our ancient Autonomy&#44; does not the undisguised opposition you met&#44; and still meet from a<lb/> very large number of your brethren&#44; deprive your institutions of the title you demand for them &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;inserted&#58; &#34;Minkyim Peshatim&#34;&#91;&#63;&#93;&#93;.<lb/>  I will be silent respecting the high value you set on the changes admitted within the last quarter of a<lb/> century&#44; though I have ever failed to discover their &#91;&#63;&#93;ging influence&#44; and others&#44; like myself&#44; honestly believe<lb/> them a compromise with habits of gentile origin&#44; and derogatory to our character.  I will even offer you thanks<lb/> for proving &#34;so tolerant and patient&#34; towards your coreligionists&#44; who think they can worship without the swelling&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> keys of a wind instrument&#44; and who still consider the separation of the sexes <hi rend="underline">the</hi> &#91;Hebrew&#93; as a wholesome provision.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;inserted&#58; Geder Ervah&#93; I will grant that only you &#34;reformers&#34; represent intellect&#44; liberation&#44; progress&#44; but I ask in the name of<lb/> the faith we all &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; in the name of p&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; which you say to be the badge of your piety&#44; I ask of you Dr. Wise to &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> your feelings&#44; and nothing but your feelings&#44; and answer if &#91;&#63;&#93; into a measure clashing with a <hi rend="underline">bona fide</hi> argument&#44;<lb/> was not deserving of condemnation rather than &#91;&#63;&#93;sternal <sic>defence</sic>&#63;  None more than my humble self can regret the<lb/> applying to secular courts &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;inserted&#58; Erckaot shet goyim&#93; for righting congregational wrongs&#59; but what redress is there left to conscientious<lb/> Israelites&#44; <del>who are</del> forcibly cast out of the house of prayer&#44; to which they are fondly attached&#44; and which their means<lb/> and exertions helped to set up&#63;  Must they &#91;&#63;&#93; yield&#44; because &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#91;inserted&#58; Man dealim gebar&#93; Might <hi rend="underline">is</hi> right&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>And when some simple&#45;hearted&#44; ingeniously proper a remedy to existing evils in the form of an advisory Board&#44;<lb/> to whom &#91;&#63;&#93;tical questions may be submitted&#44; and by whose &#91;&#63;&#93; judgment and conciliatory counsel<lb/> what we both lament&#44; namely &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; might be averted&#44; you hold the idea to public contempt as savory<lb/> of the inquisition.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Not an ecclesiastical court that cannot take root in these states but a convention<lb/> of learned and God&#45;fearing men ought indeed to bring order out of chaos.  We&#44; Denominationally&#44;<lb/> present a pitiful sight.  Yet&#44; by the honesty and wisdom of men&#44; who should not be wanting<lb/> among the myriads of American Jews&#8212;what is now &#91;&#63;&#93; small fragments might be<lb/> made to coalesce into a compact body.  I conceive it to be the duty of Hebrew journalists to<lb/> encourage the slightest effort towards the accomplishing of that end.  For glory will it be to the<lb/> heavenly Preserver of our liberties&#44; when we&#44; specially favored&#44; shall unite in a worship characteristic of<lb/> our descent&#44; a worship &#91;&#63;&#93; our history&#44; our high mission and with it our indissoluble<lb/> conviction with <del>all</del> the dispersed of Judah&#44; wherever their lot may have been cast.<lb/></p>
