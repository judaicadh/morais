            <p>instantaneously visit upon us our offences&#44;<lb/> who allows the sinner time to bethink himself<lb/> and retract.  But did I say &#34;upon us&#34;&#63;  Is the<lb/> reproach recorded against our ancestors&#44; in the section<lb/> of this Sabbath&#44; applicable to ourselves also&#63;  Aye&#44;<lb/> even so&#44; my dear Brethren&#33;  The Father of all living&#44;<lb/> provides for our necessities&#44; and though little might<lb/> suffice us&#44; he with an unsparing bountiful hand showers down<lb/> an exuberance of good &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The fields<lb/> invite us to feast on their rich produce&#44; the sea<lb/> offers us an ample tribute.  We luxuriate on countless<lb/> species of nutriments&#44; but withal we are discontent.<lb/>  Verily&#44; our ingratitude exceeds that of which our ances&#45;<lb/>&#45;tors became guilty&#44; for&#44; they murmured because unable<lb/> to multiply their viands&#44; we complain though<lb/> an immense variety thereof be at our command.<lb/>  A beneficent Lord grants us affluence&#44; but out<lb/> demeanour is that of the hapless necessitous.  We toil<lb/> and plod as he who needs a morsel to sustain his<lb/> famished children.  Possessed of the means to satisfy<lb/> all our requirements&#44; we despond&#44; if our material advan&#45;<lb/>&#45;cement falls short of our anticipations.  Hence it is<lb/> that labour&#44; which should dignify our existence&#44;<lb/></p>

Its exercise intended to preserve<lb/> in us&#44; a hale body and a cheerful mind&#44; becomes<lb/> a bane to both&#59; for&#44; whereas we ought to regulate<lb/> it wisely&#44; we are ruled by it despotically.  We should<lb/> remember &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;that man liveth not on<lb/> bread alone&#34; and that the Sovereign of the Universe&#44;<lb/> dispenses the same super abundantly&#44; in order that we might<lb/> employ our noble faculties&#44; for higher purposes&#59; but<lb/> a wrong impression has laid hold of the human mind.<lb/>  We believe&#44; as &#40;because the common adage teaches it&#41; that business<lb/> <sic>preceeds</sic> all things&#59; but it is an error&#44; my friends&#33; a<lb/> fatal error which occasions days of sorrow&#44; and sleepless<lb/> nights.  Not business&#44; but duty must <sic>preceed</sic> all<lb/> things.  To be sure&#44; it is the obligation of every<lb/> man to labour.  The sluggard falsifies his being&#44; and<lb/> whether he be rich or poor he is despicable&#44; but we<lb/> are told that there are such &#34;whose labour is with<lb/> wisdom and knowledge&#34; while that of others is with<lb/> folly and indiscretion.  To apportion certain hours<lb/> to work&#44; to steadily follow it&#44; is laudable&#44; but<lb/> to sacrifice to it all hours&#59; the comforts of home&#44;<lb/> the pleasure of a domestic repast&#44; the delightful<lb/> task of studying and promoting the good tendencies of<lb/></p>

            <p>of our tender offspring&#44; is not alone reprehensible<lb/> but sinful.  It is evincing ingratitude to Him&#44; who<lb/> supplies us with more than we actually require&#59;<lb/> for&#44; what could impel us thus to be fettered by incessant<lb/> labour&#63;  What&#59; but an ungodly fear that the<lb/> Power which sustains the world might flag&#44; and we<lb/> perish for want&#33;  There are many of even among us who store their houses with<lb/> the choice increase of the earth.  Many who have built their<lb/> own dwellings and provided themselves against all seasons&#44;<lb/> but notwithstanding that they will drudge at all season for the acquisi&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of a substance&#44; which they can never enjoy&#44; because<lb/> superfluous&#44; and their successors may squander<lb/> away.  Exhort such ones&#44; to labour less&#44; and confide more<lb/> in God.  To have the moral welfare of their children<lb/> at heart&#44; and to let them seek their own material progress&#44;<lb/> To devote some of their time to the furtherance of<lb/> their spiritual improvement&#59; to muse upon<lb/> the law of the Eternal&#44; and contemplate his handiwork&#44;<lb/> and they will probably answer&#44; that their acquisitions<lb/> are not yet set upon an immoveable footing&#44; that they<lb/> fear reverses&#44; and must therefore strive unremittingly<lb/> to augment their possessions.  It is&#44; my Brethren&#44;<lb/> that want of confidence in our Celestial Benefactor&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>that delivers consigns us in shackles to constant toil.  It is<lb/> that which often shuts out from our breasts a feeling<lb/> of kindliness and charity for they who need&#44; and have a<lb/> claim on our assistance.  It is that which creates the<lb/> vampyre that sucks out the life&#45;blood of the miser.<lb/>  Two days since&#44; one of our city journals illustrated my<lb/> position&#44; by recounting that an individual&#44; who had<lb/> amassed a fortune&#44; by ding of his industry&#44; was seized<lb/> with the dread of losing it&#44; and so powerfully did the evil thought<lb/> prey on his mind&#44; that he committed self&#45;destruction.<lb/>  Such an example&#44; is happily very rare&#44; but it never&#45;<lb/>&#45;theless corroborates what the wisest of men&#44; wrote by<lb/> inspiration&#59; &#34;The fear which man entertaineth is to<lb/> him a snare&#59; but whosoever putteth his trust in the<lb/> Lord shall be set on high&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Better is a handful with quietness&#44; than both the hands full&#44;<lb/> with travail and vexation of spirit&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#45;&#45;.

To seek the enlargement of our sphere of<lb/> action&#44; to endeavour honestly to increase our possessions&#44;<lb/> may be productive of happiness to ourselves and our<lb/> fellow&#45;beings but if we render that the sole aim<lb/> of our life&#44; they it will be apt to engender an ambition<lb/> which knows no bound&#59; for &#34;he that loveth silver&#44; will<lb/> never be satisfied with it&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/>  If we deliver up the best years of our existence to the pursuit<lb/> of what is perishable&#44; our demeanour will be as condemnable<lb/> as that of our fathers&#44; who&#44; for the gratification of the appetites&#44;<lb/> they would fain have offered their liberty.  If despite the infinite<lb/> care which our Father in heaven&#44; bestows on his creatures&#44;<lb/> we aspire to the attainment of the superfluities&#44; we will<lb/> prove ourselves more unthankful than they were&#59; for&#44;<lb/> immeasurably larger than theirs&#44; is the compass<lb/> of our enjoyments.<lb/></p>
