                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>To allow this Sabbath to pass&#44; and remain entirely silent<lb/> concerning the event which occurred on it thirty seven<lb/> years ago&#44; would not be wrong proper&#44; according to my mode of thinking.  On other years&#44; when<lb/> the first portion of the book of Numbers was is being<lb/> read&#44; I have generally detained the attendants my fellow co&#45;<sic>worshippers</sic> with the<lb/> narrative of events circumstances which preceded the building of<lb/> this sacred edifice&#44; or with occurrences that of incidents attending<lb/> our first and subsequent services rendered here&#44; after since<lb/> the consecration thereof.  Several times my anniver&#45;<lb/>&#45;sary discourse&#44; was by request&#44; or by my own option&#44;<lb/> published in Jewish papers&#44; or in pamphlet form.<lb/>  To follow such a plan this year&#44; would necessi&#45;<lb/>&#45;tate the composing of a regular sermon&#44; but<lb/> neither am I prepared for that task&#44; nor do<lb/> I consider it discreet to lecture on two con&#45;<lb/>&#45;secutive days.<lb/></p>
            <p>There really exists in America an abuse&#44; which<lb/> ought to be corrected.  The human mind is not<lb/> exhaustless&#44; and to demand of any person of an<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>average talent capacities a set&#45;speech with great frequency&#44;<lb/> is to cause a strain painfully trying.  At least&#44;<lb/> I would find it so at my age&#44; and in a state<lb/> of health not very robust flourishing.  I shall en&#45;<lb/>&#45;deavour tomorrow to preach on the a subject of which<lb/> Shabunget&#91;&#63;&#93; suggests.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am aware that some of my colleagues have made<lb/> it a practice of late to acquaint their constituents<lb/> before hand in advance with their intention to hold a special<lb/> festivity in their respective temples&#44; when the return<lb/> of the natal day of those of places of worship&#44; or of their<lb/> own inception into office arrives.  I have not deemed<lb/> it proper fitting to do so.  I feared that the action<lb/> might give room to a misapprehension.  What<lb/> I would much prefer to such spasmodic large<lb/> assemblages brought about by a clerical<lb/> invitation&#44; is an early&#44; regular and decorous ga&#45;<lb/>&#45;thering every sabbath.  Anniversaries<lb/> of synagogal&#44; or of personal character are nowhere<lb/> enjoyined&#44; but to hold holy conversations on cer&#45;<lb/>&#45;tain defined days&#44; is a command of the Torah.<lb/></p>
            <p>Although my sight is slightly dimmed&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>and the light within these walls&#44; is not very particularly<lb/> bright&#44; I look anxiously on all sides up and<lb/> down each seventh day&#44; to discover who is missing.<lb/>  I feel sad&#44; if some that habitually mostly attend the<lb/> service&#44; are absent.<lb/></p>
            <p>We can indeed spare none&#44; for every loss by death&#44;<lb/> leaves behind a void not easily filled.  Naturally&#44;<lb/> among the many who joined me in prayer on this<lb/> sacred spot just 37 years ago&#44; some not a few have passed<lb/> away from earth.  With some honorable ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceptions&#44; their offspring have estranged them&#45;<lb/>selves from the sanctuary which their parents<lb/> habitually visited&#44; with frequency&#44; and chose above all<lb/> other shrines.  My ardent wish and pra&#45;<lb/>&#45;yer are for the continuance of this &#91;Hebrew&#93;  &#34;Hope of<lb/> Israel&#34;.  The strong deep sentiments which I entertain<lb/> about in regard to it&#44; may be the effect of an unprecedented<lb/> continuance&#44; as a guide of this religious body.<lb/>  May be also that I imagine our corporate per&#45;<lb/>&#45;manence necessary to Judaism.  At all events&#44; I com&#45;<lb/>mit its preservation to your zeal&#44; my brothers and sisters<lb/> in faith.  It is with you&#44; under God&#44; to<lb/></p>

            <p>make most efficacious provisions&#44; in order that<lb/> the first place community of Jewish worshipers in Philadel&#45;<lb/>&#45;phia&#44; may never perish from the earth.<lb/></p>
            <p>And Thou&#44; Rock of our refuge&#44; who hast per&#45;<lb/>&#45;mitted thirty seven years to glide roll by&#44; and<lb/> see this building&#44; typical remain an typical exponent of conservatism&#44; unde&#45;<lb/> &#45;cayed&#44; notwithstanding adverse occurrences let circumstances of frequent occurrence adverse to it&#44;<lb/> let Thy Divine grace rest thereupon. it.  Even as the<lb/> structure&#44; which preceded it&#44; was vouchsafed an<lb/> existence of nearly eight decades&#44; without the<lb/> loss of its original prestige&#44; so may this one or any hereafter continue<lb/> to hold the same honorable significative appellation &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; to the<lb/> praise of the supporters thereof and to Thy celestial<lb/> glory.  Amen.<lb/></p>
