            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Friends.  When the Author of human existence&#44; pleases to bless<lb/> the marriage union of two of his creatures with offspring&#44; the stroke<lb/> of death which cuts off the life of either the husband or the wife&#44;<lb/> is severely but not unbearably felt by the survivor.  If religious<lb/> training and good example had been steadily at work&#44; the in&#45;<lb/>&#45;fluence they exercise over the conduct of the children will act as<lb/> a balm to the heart of the sorrow&#45;stricken parent.  The dutifulness&#44;<lb/> the tender love of sons and daughters will procure a restorative to<lb/> the keep keen pain of a bereaved the one who has lost a life companion.<lb/>  Even if too young thus to ally distress&#44; their childrens&#39; presence&#44; they<lb/> thoughts they call forth&#44; a sense of paternal or maternal obligations<lb/> will draw us out of the affliction into which death had plunged<lb/> our minds.  We shall feel the absence of the departed&#44; but we<lb/> will find in the home he or she has left&#44; objects to pleasurably en&#45;<lb/>&#45;gage our attention.<lb/></p>
            <p>It is when the Almighty has withheld the fruit of connubial<lb/> relations&#44; that the decease demise of either the husband or the wife&#44; whose<lb/> mutual affection had been strong and pure&#44; brings in its train<lb/> unutterable desolation.  The object upon whom our hopes and<lb/> longings were centred is gone for ever.  The signs of conjugal<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>devotion meet the eye everywhere&#44; but the heart which prompted<lb/> to offer the those evidences of affection has ceased to throb&#44; the voice which spoke tenderly<lb/> is hushed in the grave&#44; the only being who formed in the world in<lb/> which we enjoyed existence has vanished from sight.  Joyless<lb/> does then the survivor sit where before all breathed gladness.<lb/>  Israelites.  In the soul&#45;stirring lamentation which we have<lb/> read during this month of sad memories to our people&#44; the<lb/> poet of our woes describes the ancient capital of Judea as<lb/> a widow who dwells solitary and disconsolate.  The com&#45;<lb/>&#45;parison is striking in its naturalness&#44; and we who sympa&#45;<lb/>&#45;thise with our fellow&#45;creatures in their bereavements&#44; instinct&#45;<lb/>&#45;ively turn our thoughts at this moment to the relict of our<lb/> brother in faith&#44; Abraham S. Wolf.  We feel for her who<lb/> has lost the lover of her girlhood&#44; the companion of her ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;turer years&#44; the devoted husband&#59; he who&#44; in the language<lb/> of Elkanah to Hannah&#44; might have asked his Mary<lb/> &#34;Am I not better to thee than ten children&#44;&#34; sure to receive<lb/> a yes in all earnestness and truth.  The worldly&#44;<lb/> those who believe that gold possesses an omnipotent<lb/> power&#44; will tell us that affluence will can supply the place<lb/> of endearments and fond caresses&#44; that soft cushions<lb/> and dainty tables can&#44; dispense with the sweet may will compensate for the sweet pri<lb/>&#45;vation of the sweet<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>association of a copartner and adviser in the walks<lb/> of life&#44; but the godly&#44; those who believe in a higher<lb/> and nobler nature than the material and the perishable&#44;<lb/> will pity the condition of the bereaved&#45;&#45;be they even the<lb/> wealthiest&#45;&#45;who have buried one so all&#45;important to<lb/> human happiness&#44; as our lamented brother coreligionist was to his wife.<lb/>  But has this loss dried up every source of enjoy&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment&#63;  Must she that has experienced so a sudden and<lb/> poignant a sorrow set therefore her tearful eyes on a vacant<lb/> seat&#44; and pine in solitude&#63;  No friends.  The Almighty<lb/> has opened in her heart a fountain of exhaustless plea&#45;<lb/>&#45;sures.  She needs not fasten her looks upon one a<lb/> single spot&#44; and bemoan her fate&#44; when many&#44; very<lb/> many beyond her home&#44; recognize her already as a<lb/> faithful worker in the <sic>feild</sic> of beneficence.<lb/></p>
            <p>Aye&#33; by redoubling her efforts&#44; by devoting her time still<lb/> more closely to the task she has long followed&#44; by<lb/> bestowing&#44; as a trusty almoner of our public charities&#44; and<lb/> as a generous benefactress the means which relieve<lb/> poverty and elevate the poor&#44; she will gradually<lb/> scatter apart the clouds which now hang over her horizon<lb/> and gain a state of spiritual serenity.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I may venture to assert that he who was her dearest on<lb/> earth will approve in heaven of the course&#44; which I feel am<lb/> confident&#44; she will pursue.  For justice impels me to ack&#45;<lb/>&#45;nowledge that the filling of responsible positions&#44; as related today<lb/> in one of our city&#45;journal is not the only merit in the character<lb/> of Abraham S. Wolf.  That circumstance may show a dis&#45;<lb/>position to be of actively useful&#44; but the President&#44; and vice President&#44; the<lb/> Treasurer and Director of various associations personally carried out<lb/> the dictates of goodness.  Without seeking the applause of mul&#45;<lb/>&#45;titudes&#44; he practised thoughtful kindness.  and I have witnessed<lb/> marks his tokens of attention gentle and delicate attention to the modest and<lb/> retiring in the hour of need.
