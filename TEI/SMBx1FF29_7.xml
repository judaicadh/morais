                June 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1870<lb/>
            Sir&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>I regret not having the pleasure<lb/> of seeing you yesterday&#44; and regret still<lb/> more that my time is so necessarily<lb/> occupied that I cannot at present call<lb/> on you.  I therefore must state my<lb/> requests in writing and beg for a reply&#44;<lb/> I repeated that you&#44; in course of conversation<lb/> with my sister Bel&#44; prior to her departure<lb/> <sic>tuesday</sic> morning last&#44; said to her<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Bel&#44; if you feel as you say you do<lb/> from conviction and that you have been<lb/> going to church for some time&#44; you still<lb/> might have gone to church and spared<lb/> your old Father and mothers heart&#44; who<lb/> can have but a few years to live and<lb/> not had this public baptism.&#34;  I cannot<lb/> vouch for the words you used but this<lb/> was my understanding of their meaning.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Will you favor me am I correct or not<lb/> in my construction of your meaning&#44; if<lb/> I am not correct please inform me what<lb/> you did say and I will retract my<lb/> version of it.  I have not time to write<lb/> more fully but will simply say that I<lb/> have had nothing to do with this unfortunate<lb/> affair&#44; that I knew nothing of it till I<lb/> was told by my sister Elisa after it happened&#44;<lb/> that I mourn my sisters absence as deeply<lb/> as any one&#44; <hi rend="underline">that I was born a jew&#44; that<lb/> I respect my faith and by the help of<lb/> God hope to die a jew</hi>.  I will be very<lb/> thankful if you will ask Mrs A Hart to<lb/> show you a letter I have written her on<lb/> the subject&#44; to day.<lb/></p>
            <p>Respectfully &#38;c<lb/>
            J. M. Emanuel<lb/>

            <p>Mr &#91;&#63;&#93; Emanuel<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr Sir&#33; Your note of yesterday reached me this evening&#44; what you<lb/> request I reply in writing.  I am glad&#44; <del>however that</del> you offer me the<lb/> opportunity to disabuse your mind of the false impression received.<lb/>  It would&#8212;of course&#8212;be impossible for me to repeat verbatim&#44; what I<lb/> said to the erring one in the interview&#44; which to my regret could not be<lb/> made private.  But this I remember distinctly&#44; that her frequent attendance<lb/> at the church did not at all for a part of our conversation.<lb/></p>
            <p>I expressed&#44; at the outset&#44; the deep grief I experienced at the step she had taken.  She<lb/> answered that her home had been made very unhappy&#44; through various<lb/> circumstances.  I then remarked that she should have respected parental<lb/> feelings and kept in view the sorrow she would occasion to those who had<lb/> stood breathlessly at her bed&#45;side in time of sickness&#44; and who had bestowed so<lb/> much care upon the preservation of her body and the development of her mind.<lb/>  She said&#44; that actuated by filial regard she had conformed to practices she<lb/> disliked.</p>
