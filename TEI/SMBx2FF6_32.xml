            <p>Cincinnati April 9. 1878.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev S. Morais<lb/>
            My valued friend&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your postal card reached me to day&#44;<lb/> and as the matter at time required some more expla&#45;<lb/>nation than could be embodied in a telegram very well.<lb/>  I thought better to write you in detail relative to your<lb/> enquiry.  I enclose you a copy of the present constitu&#45;<lb/>tion which we are working under&#44; and will also give<lb/> you the amendment thereto which the committee of the<lb/> Board of Delegates have required of us to embody in the<lb/> constitution as a sine qui non for a basis of emalgation&#91;sic&#63;&#93;&#44;<lb/> now in reply to your card&#44; <hi rend="underline">you are perfectly correct</hi><lb/> as to what you understood from me when in Philadel&#45;<lb/>phia&#44; our congregations render an account <hi rend="underline">for so ma&#45;<lb/>ny members</hi>&#44; renters of seats who have no voice in the<lb/> congregation no account is taken of them&#44; when a congre<lb/>gation join the union&#44; they report their number of mem&#45;<lb/>bers and we do not go back of that return&#44; if the<lb/> congregation Beth&#45;El&#45;Emeth write with us&#44; whatever num&#45;<lb/>ber of members they report as contributing members<lb/> to that congregation&#44; it is supposed to be correct &#34;<hi rend="underline">we do<lb/> not go back of the returns</hi>&#44;&#34; if the &#34;Mickvah Israel Cong&#45;<lb/>regation resolve to come into the union&#44; the are ex&#45;<lb/>pected to report to many <hi rend="underline">contributing members</hi>&#44; it is taken<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>for granted that they have rendered a correct report&#44;<lb/> Dr Lilienthal&#39;s congregation for example&#44; has say&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">180 duly elected members</hi>&#44; and say 40 or 50 or more<lb/> <hi rend="underline">seat renters or holders</hi> as they may be properly<lb/> termed&#44; who have no voice in the congregation at all&#44;<lb/> have no other interest than to occupy a seat&#44;<lb/> we would report 180 <hi rend="underline">contributing members</hi>&#44; using the<lb/> phraseology of the constitution&#59; but&#44; if the constitution<lb/> is amended in accordance with the wish of<lb/> the congregations&#44; or the committee who represent<lb/> the Board of Delegates&#44; we would be obliged to<lb/> report 220 or 230 or more contributing members and<lb/> seat holders&#59; this amendment was proposed to meet<lb/> the emergency of the Eastern Congregations&#44; that<lb/> they might be enabled to raise their minimum<lb/> of 2000 members&#59; as they proposed to do&#44; if we<lb/> make the various amendments they have proposed&#44;<lb/> of which I send you a marked copy&#44; of the pro&#45;<lb/>ceedings of last council&#58; congregations that <hi rend="underline">now<lb/> join the union unconditionally</hi> as all have done<lb/> heretofore&#44; come in under the provisions of the pres&#45;<lb/>ent constitution&#44; and they must construe its meaning<lb/> according to their capacity&#44; of understanding <del>of</del> it&#44;<lb/> I say <hi rend="underline">unconditionally</hi>&#44; from the fact&#44; that some<lb/> may join&#44; provided that we adopt the proposed<lb/> amendments to the constitution&#58; If 2000 members are<lb/> represented by the Eastern congregations they will be<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>adopted&#44; as we have pledged ourselves to do so<lb/> we have one congregation in Phila&#44; the Beth&#45;Israel<lb/> report 70 &#34;contributing members&#44;&#34; now you can <sic>accertain</sic><lb/> from Mr Lewine on what they base <sic>there</sic> report on<lb/> and let your congregation act accordingly.<lb/></p>
            <p>I think that I have covered all the grounds<lb/> in the case&#44; with the enclosed you will also<lb/> find the list of congregations and the number<lb/> of contributing members each report.<lb/></p>
            <p>Since writing&#44; I have <sic>accertained</sic> the status<lb/> on which <hi rend="underline">our</hi> congregations will base their<lb/> contributing membership upon&#58; and although I said<lb/> that if the constitution is amended that the<lb/> number would be augmented from 180 to 220 &#38;c<lb/> I was wrong&#44; as the fact is what is called<lb/> seat holders or renters here&#44; in contradistinction<lb/> from contributing members&#44; is&#44; that they have<lb/> <hi rend="underline">no privilege</hi> or <hi rend="underline">immunities</hi> of the congrega&#45;<lb/>tions whatever&#44; except occupying a seat at<lb/> worship&#58; only elected members have rights to bu&#45;<lb/>rial or the services of the officers of the congre&#45;<lb/>gation for <sic>mariages</sic> &#38;c <hi rend="underline">they can claim no rights</hi>&#44;<lb/> but still if Dr Wise or Lilienthal is called upon<lb/> they marry any one whether a member or<lb/> not as the Parnassim exercise no control in<lb/> this matter&#34;&#34;and the congregations extend favours also.<lb/></p>
            <p>I hope you will comprehend fully what<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I have written&#44; I was not before aware&#44;<lb/> until I consulted Mr Solomon Levi what the<lb/> status of <hi rend="underline">our</hi> seat renters were&#44; probably<lb/> differing somewhat those of Eastern Congre<lb/>gations.  Still I think that I am safe<lb/> in saying that nine tenths fully of the<lb/> congregations now in the union&#44; only report<lb/> their bona fide elected members&#44; whilst<lb/> their seat renters have all rights and<lb/> immunities except voting at meetings &#38;c.<lb/>  Still we will never <hi rend="underline">go back of their returns</hi>&#44;<lb/> with kind regards&#44; and hoping that the K. K.<lb/> Mickvah <sic>Isreal</sic> may fall next in line I<lb/> remain</p>			<p>truly as ever<lb/>

            <p>&#34;Under present constitution contributing<lb/> members only pay proposed contribution contrib&#45;<lb/>uting members and seat holders must pay&#34;<lb/></p>
