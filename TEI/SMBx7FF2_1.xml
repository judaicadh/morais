            <p>New York&#44; August 24 1893<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr. S Morais<lb/>
                Dear Dr.<lb/></p>
            <p>On Sunday last there were present at the meeting<lb/> to consider the schedule for the ensuing term&#59; Drs. Kohut&#44; Kaiser&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44;<lb/> Drachman &#38; Joffe&#44; &#38; Mr. Reeder &#38; myself.  There were several<lb/> further conferences to continue &#38; complete the work.  The result<lb/> you will find in the enclosed draft which after having received<lb/> your revision &#38; sanction&#44; will have to remain provisional for<lb/> a week or so to see how it works&#44; before we have it printed.<lb/></p>
            <p>It was also decided to have the opening on August 27; and to<lb/> have the entrance examinations on the same day at 3 P. M.  It will<lb/> be understood however that if you cannot be present at that time that<lb/> the examinations will be postponed&#44; or held conditional upon a future<lb/> examination by you.<lb/></p>
            <p>I enclose you also the formal application of Nathan Wolf of whom we<lb/> all think favorably here.  Shall we have him come on at once for the<lb/> regular entrance examination to take his place in his calls at once&#63;<lb/>  Or do you wish to see him first in Phila.&#44; or to correspond with Dr. Friedenwald.<lb/>  Whichever course you deem most advisable would you kindly drop him a line<lb/> to inform him of your decision.<lb/></p>
            <p>I think you will find in your study of the new schedule that it allows<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>faithfully to the curriculum as laid down for us.  In fact now faithfully<lb/> there hitherto&#44; except that we have laid more stress on Hebrew Composition<lb/> in accordance with your frequent suggestions to be.  It provides<lb/> for Dr. Joffe 24 hours  Senior A 30 hrs. Prep. &#34;A&#34;&#45;&#45;7 hrs.<lb/> Dr. Drachman 19 hours  &#91;Senior&#93; B 18 hrs &#91;Prep&#93; &#34;B&#34;&#45;&#45;7 &#91;hrs.&#93;<lb/> Mr. Speaker 15 hours  Junior 11 &#91;hrs.&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>I am of the opinion that both of the Preparatory divisions should receive<lb/> two hours additional at least.  Each has three days entirely vacant.<lb/>  I think Dr. Drachman should put in from 3&#45;4 on Thursday&#59; from<lb/> 5&#45;6 on Sunday &#38; either 3&#45;4 or 7&#45;8 on Wednesday.  On account of the<lb/> additional class both of the other instructors have been burdened with<lb/> an increase of hours and I believe that Dr Drachman should do<lb/> the same.  We cannot afford another teacher now &#38; we cannot afford<lb/> to increase salaries for the present.  The hard times will undoubtedly<lb/> have an effect on our income as they will on all communal institutions.<lb/>  Dr. D. should also consider that the following little table tells a story that<lb/> is very disagreeable to his colleagues<lb/></p>

            <p>I am usually pretty plain&#45;spoken&#44; but I cannot say these things in this<lb/> way to Dr. D.  I tried my hardest to get him to see the need for more hours<lb/> but he strove rather for less.  I am sorry to trouble you about such things.<lb/>  But&#44; I thought you ought to know at any rate&#44; particularly as I fear<lb/></p>

            <p>I will have some trouble with Speaker.  He consented to give us<lb/> three more hours without a raise with the understanding that about one<lb/> third of the fifteen hours would be in the morninf&#59; But that could not<lb/> be arranged.<lb/></p>
            <p>In regard to Chazenoth&#44; even if we make no arrangements with the<lb/> Canter&#39;s Asso.&#44; as a body&#44; we will have little trouble in securing the aid<lb/> of one or two of the musically&#45;trained cantors to undertake this work.<lb/>  I believe the matter of speaking in the 29th Str synagogue by<lb/> Wittenburg on the holidays&#44; is off.  The feeling was expressed that they would<lb/> prefer &#34;A large man with a beard.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Of course you will notice that in a number of subjects the two<lb/> senior divisions have their hours together &#38; occasionally the<lb/> Juniors with the Senior B<lb/></p>
            <p>I do hope that you will soon be entirely relieved of your burden of<lb/> illness &#38; restored fully to good health &#38; spirits.  Whatever we can do here<lb/> to make yours lighter in connection with the seminary&#44; to carry out your<lb/> wishes &#38; to <sic>fulfil</sic> your hopes&#44; you can be sure we are always anxious<lb/> &#38; willing to do.<lb/></p>
            <p>My wife joins in sending the heartiest greetings &#38; thanking you for your<lb/> wishes in behalf of our dear little ones<lb/> I am yours sincerely<lb/> Max Cohen<lb/></p>
