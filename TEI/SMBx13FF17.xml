            <p>Brethren.<lb/></p>
            <p>As a matter of course I am not in full accord of sentiments<lb/> with the pan&#45;Presbyterian Council&#44; still in session in our<lb/> city.  In realty reality the proceedings of a vast meeting of representative<lb/> men&#44; who have been brought together from near and from far&#44;<lb/> for a purpose which they hold sacred&#44; and which did and doubt&#45;<lb/>&#45;less will accomplish much good&#44; must of necessity command<lb/> respect&#44; but most of the questions discussed at the convention&#44;<lb/> are of a character not likely to interest the world at large&#44; and<lb/> less than all that small portion of the human race&#44; called<lb/> &#34;Israel&#34;.  The urging of the acceptance of dogmas repugnant to the belief in<lb/> One all&#45;sufficient Creator and Ruler&#59; the enforceing effort to the of a Sab&#45;<lb/>&#45;bath&#44; which is not the Sabbath of a Divine revelation&#59;<lb/> and the enjoining of a complex church discipline&#44; which is at<lb/> variance with the simple government of the Synagogue&#44; such questions<lb/> I say&#44; and others of a similar nature&#44; starting from points inadmis&#45;<lb/>&#45;sible in Judaism&#44; and not even acceptable to the all Christen&#45;<lb/>&#45;dom&#44; deny the Council a claim to universal attention.<lb/>  Yet among the numerous topics submitted to the consideration<lb/> of an meeting assembly composed of learned ministers and laymen&#44; some<lb/> commend themselves to the reflection of Jews as well as Gentiles.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Notably the remarks which fell from the lips of Dr<lb/> James Mc&#39;Cosh&#44; President of Princeton college&#44; have a<lb/> direct application to all peoples and denominations.<lb/>  The eminent Professor spoke wisely&#44; when he advised the elders<lb/> to deal tenderly with the young&#44; in this age of unsettled opi&#45;<lb/>&#45;nions.  I heartily agree with the views he advanced.<lb/>  &#40;&#91; inserted by author&#41; Educated youths need our the sympathies and not the frowns of<lb/> their more experienced brethren fellow&#45;creatures.  Cultured young folks are not&#44;<lb/> as asserted&#44; uniformly skeptical.  They do not systematic&#45;<lb/>&#45;ally throw a doubt on every religious doctrine&#44; but they waver&#44;<lb/> they halt between the old and the new.  The fault is not<lb/> theirs&#44; but it is of the time and circumstances in which they have<lb/> been placed.  They see a great deal in what is ancient&#44;<lb/> that conflicts with modern thought.  They read books<lb/> labeled &#34;perfection&#34; because their authors are confessedly<lb/> high chiefs in the realms of science&#44; masters in the art of composition.  They find<lb/> it difficult to decide between speculative theories&#44; and theologic&#45;<lb/>&#45;al dogmas.  They know not what to embrace and what to<lb/> cast off.  Still our young sons and daughters who have at all<lb/> reflected upon the laws of nature&#44; and upon man&#39;s faculties would<lb/> resent as a personal insult the charge of having taught them&#45;<lb/>&#45;selves to become Atheists or Materialists.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Unfortunately&#44; however&#44; they are drifting&#44; unconsciously<lb/> perhaps&#44; into that channel of poisonous waters.  A new<lb/> name has been invented for to represent thinking beings who remain in a<lb/> state of uncertainty about religious principles&#45;&#45;Agnosticism&#45;&#45;<lb/> Our children style themselves Agnostics.  They neither receive nor repel prevailing beliefs&#44;<lb/> but Agnosticism breeds Indifferentism&#44; and this is closely allied<lb/> to a denial of God and of our accountability to Him.<lb/>  How to avert the crisis should become the earnest and most<lb/> anxious study of the lovers of mankind.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr McCosh counsels that we deal tenderly with our youths.<lb/>  And the recommendation is excellent&#44; as the person who gave<lb/> ti is an excellent observer of the workings of the human mind.<lb/>  He The Professor has the opportunity to of searching into them&#44; and he can ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;preciate the struggle of clashing ideas.  His students find a<lb/> theology that teaches the existence of an all&#45;powerful Deity<lb/> outside of nature&#59; then again they meet with a system of<lb/> science that argues against that <sic>seperate</sic> existence&#44; and tries to prove<lb/> that the honor paid to the Deity is due to Nature.  In one book the<lb/> unity of design in the formation of every created object in the heaven<lb/> above&#44; on the earth beneath&#44; and in the water under the earth is pointed<lb/> at as suggesting the belief in a Divine Mind.  In another book&#44; everything<lb/> in the physical and moral world is explained as an inexplicably absolute<lb/> Necessity.<lb/></p>

            <p>No wonder that our reflecting youths continue undecided&#59; and<lb/> when to this state of mental vacillation&#44; we add the cravings of<lb/> the passions flesh so strong so despotic in early days&#44; &#38; a vivacious disposition restive under<lb/> religious restraints&#44; we may form a conception of the inward fight<lb/> between faith and its adversaries.  We ought to deal tenderly<lb/> with the thoughtful among the young&#44; in this age of unsettled<lb/> opinions.  We should sympathise rather than make issue with<lb/> them.  The learned professor President at Princeton college justly<lb/> remarks that it will vastly depend upon the guidance bent which<lb/> this generation will receive&#44; whether positive religion or a ne&#45;<lb/>&#45;gation of it shall win in the conflict hot contest of ideas.  He sees<lb/> much good and much evil in a state of ferment&#44; but the<lb/> good needs a kindly direction and then the evil may be<lb/> forced to serve its opposite.  In the attempt to lay open<lb/> the foundations of every belief&#44; our ambitious sons and daughters<lb/> may dig very deep and bring up dirt.  Some will jump at<lb/> a false conclusion and confound the pure with the impure&#44;k<lb/> but if a guiding hand draws our children out of the mire they<lb/> themselves have stirred raised up&#44; they will acknowledge that the<lb/> ground below was clear&#44; and that they had stirred up rubbish.<lb/>  In other words&#44; ours is an age of inquiry&#44; and intelligent youths<lb/> will stop short at nothing in the way of investigation.<lb/></p>

            <p>To upbraid them for not paying homage to the convictions<lb/> of their elders&#44; for not showing reverence to the past&#44; will<lb/> not promote the cause of religion.  It may make of them<lb/> hypocrites of them&#44; deceivers willing to hide their thoughts&#44; but not believers.<lb/>  To argue with them dispassionately&#44; to set reasonings against<lb/> reasonings&#44; to force them with by intellectual weapons to surrender<lb/> and confess God&#44; Revelation and Immortality as the only saving<lb/> triad&#44; capable of saving rescuing delivering the individual and human society<lb/> from destruction&#59; to follow that way we may will be to gain for the<lb/> world a generation of faithful.&#40;&#93; inserted by author&#41;<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren.  It does not lie in my power to ascertain whether<lb/> the subversive notions imbibed from school books&#44; and from<lb/> collegiate instruction&#44; from the intercourse with the frivolous<lb/> and from the instigations of the passions&#44; have taken harbour<lb/> in the breasts of any of my youthful hearers.  It would be hap&#45;<lb/>&#45;piness for me to know for sure with certainty that those under my ministry<lb/> think wisely and believe righteously&#44; but at all events be as it may at all events&#44; what<lb/> I intend to say hereafter in the Synagogue&#44; may be repeated<lb/> outside&#44; and effect some good among those who are infected<lb/> with ideas hostile to religion.  I purpose delivering a series<lb/> of short lectures&#44; in as easy a language&#44; as compatible with difficulty<lb/> of the subjects&#44; on God&#44; Revelation and Immortality.<lb/></p>

            <p>I may not be able to follow the course professed&#44; conse&#45;<lb/>&#45;cutively&#59; but I trust I shall not be compelled to allow a<lb/> great interval between each address.  Very possibly&#44; the arguments<lb/> I shall advance will not be new to my audience&#45;&#45;what<lb/> can be brought forward in our days which is not threadbare&#45;&#45;&#63; but<lb/> they may <sic>rewaken</sic> reflection.  I shall offer nothing original&#44; simply the result of my conscientious<lb/> studies after having consulted deep the writings of deep thinkers<lb/> and scholars of extensive learning.  May the Lord bless my intention<lb/> with success.<lb/></p>
            <p>I know that just at present&#44; a demand is made everywhere for<lb/> easy fitting instruction to the very youngest among the attendants at the<lb/> worship public service.  But I judge that I can reach that important ele&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment elsewhere.  At the Sunday&#45;school our little boys and girls<lb/> can hear me weekly.  They should be there regularly&#44; undeterred<lb/> by the weather light rain or snow&#44; and they will receive useful teaching in<lb/> the history of the Bible&#44; in the spirit of the command&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments&#44; and in the language of our prayers&#44; so that they may<lb/> become living <sic>worshippers</sic>&#44; and not merely silent spectators in the<lb/> house of God.  I now announce that to&#45;morrow morning<lb/> at 9 o&#39;clock I shall resume my tuition&#44; and will be found at the<lb/> school in 7th st above Wood till about 11 o&#39;clock.<lb/></p>
