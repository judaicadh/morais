            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>My friends&#33;  A <sic>mornful</sic> thought must needs<lb/> force itself into our minds&#44; whenever we follow<lb/> a human being to the grave.  Not because death<lb/> has any terror for him who believes in a righteous<lb/> God&#44; but because our sympathies are awakened<lb/> within us.  We feel for those whose bereavement<lb/> creates a void in their midst&#44; which can never<lb/> be filled.  These sentiments&#44; however&#44; increase<lb/> in intensity&#44; when the object lost is an aged mother.<lb/>  Her&#44; who above all earthly friends&#44; is the nearest<lb/> and dearest to man&#39;s heart.  It is no comfort<lb/> to know that she had over reached out lived the period allotted<lb/> to mortals here below&#59; on the contrary time fastens<lb/> the knot which binds us to those who we love<lb/> or respect.  And if a tear will involuntarily<lb/> flow&#44; at when parting with those at whose hands we<lb/> received tokens of regard&#44; what must children<lb/> feel&#44; when at being for ever separated from<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>one&#44; whom God appointed as their tutelary<lb/> angel&#63;  The memory of the past must<lb/> then crowd the mind.  the years of innocence&#44;<lb/> when their heads were pillowed on their mother&#39;s<lb/> breast.  Her anxiety at the hour of sickness.<lb/>  Her watchful care for over their infant frames&#44; all<lb/> this &#38; kindred thoughts must be brought vividly back to their<lb/> recollection&#59; and they will deeply mourn.<lb/></p>
            <p>Yet&#44; my knowledge of our sister&#39;s offspring&#44; who now<lb/> surround her coffin&#44; is not such as to enable<lb/> me to say&#44; whether their religious or moral<lb/> character reflects honor on their deceased parent.<lb/>  But I feel convinced that at this solemn<lb/> moment they are drawn nearer to their heavenly<lb/> Maker&#44; and they pray for the repose of her&#44; who<lb/> first taught them to acknowledge his name.<lb/>  As to the lamented being&#44; whose spirit has<lb/> flown to the regions above&#44; I am incapacitated<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>from speaking either in eulogistic terms or<lb/> otherwise.  I did in former years meet her occasionally at<lb/> the house of a daughter&#44; who has preceded her<lb/> the the land of the blessed&#44; but her age prevented<lb/> her already from entering freely into familiar<lb/> converse.  This natural impediment&#44; was ag&#45;<lb/>gravated by a defect in her hearing.<lb/></p>
            <p>Nevertheless&#44; should I judge from her appearance<lb/> at the house of God&#44; I would say&#44; that she was<lb/> piously inclined&#59; for it was decorous&#59; and she<lb/> attended worship with commendable regularity.<lb/>  At late years&#44; she withdrew altogether from society&#44;<lb/> and it was not since then my privilege to privately<lb/> cultivate her acquaintance.  In fact&#44; my<lb/> ignorance of her character would have <sic>counselled</sic><lb/> silence&#44; lest I did injustice to her memory.<lb/>  But I could not refuse a request made by a<lb/> member of my congregation&#44; and I was induced<lb/> to speak.  Let me hope that the<lb/> discharge of this duty&#44; has not been barren of fruit.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Let me hope&#44; my dear friends&#44; that our gathering thoughts<lb/> around of the dead&#44; has inspired us with awe for<lb/> the great judge to whom we must sooner or<lb/> later render an account of our deeds on earth.<lb/>  Let me hope that this divine fear will be the<lb/> means of cleansing us from human dross&#44; and by<lb/> spiritualizing our existence&#44; secure unto us a<lb/> place at the foot of the throne of mercy&#44; even<lb/> at that of our everlasting God.<lb/></p>
