            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Fellow mortals.  We have gathered assembled together to pay that<lb/> tribute of respect which the living owe the dead&#44; ir&#45;<lb/>&#45;respective of the merits or demerits&#44; ascribed to those<lb/> who have departed for the spirit land. of spirits.  The ordin&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance of the ancient Sages is not restrictive broad in its character.  It bids us give<lb/> all an honorable burial&#44; as creatures who bore indelibly<lb/> the stamp of their divine Creator.  We shall therefore ac&#45;<lb/>&#45;company&#44; amidst the solemnity of prayers and psalms&#44; the remains<lb/> of Joseph M. Leon to the grave that he chose for them in life.<lb/>  We will not lavish encomiums which his sense<lb/> of right would have rejected as fulsome&#59; nor will we<lb/> presume to pass a judgment at which he would might have been pained.<lb/>  To I hold that to utter a truth&#44; a pure self evident unadulterated truth&#44; that which will sets a halo round<lb/> the memory of the deceased&#44; is assuredly becoming<lb/> and profitable.  Aye&#58; It is becoming to tell bearded men&#44;<lb/> and full grown women that filial dutifulness and<lb/> filial affection are virtues of imperishable value.  It is<lb/> profitable to society at large to that we should point to such illustrations<lb/> of those qualities&#44; as may serve to furnish models challenging worthy of imitation.<lb/>  How far the life of our brother&#39;s career exemplified those ten<lb/> commands&#44; from which communities&#44; like individuals&#44; drive<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>moral support&#44; I am unable to tell say&#44; but<lb/> that he carried out the fifth most admirably&#44; I<lb/> myself have witnessed.  He honored his widowed mother<lb/> with unceasing tokens of veneration.  She was<lb/> old&#44; very old and infirm&#44; when he had already attained&#44; an advanced<lb/> age yet&#44; but&#44; to use a Scriptural phrase&#44; his devotion removed her youth like the eagle&#39;s plumage.  She was strongly attached to practices which<lb/> he did not deem of importance.  She was fond of home<lb/> rules&#44; which afforded him no satisfaction&#44; yet still&#44; nothing<lb/> was called trifling&#44; nothing was neglected that might gratify his mother&#39;s welfare her who bore and nurtured<lb/> and tenderly reared him.  Religiously he studied that mother&#39;s welfare.<lb/>  Nights were turned into days while keeping watch<lb/> over all her&#44; when the years of decrepitude had come on.<lb/>  Days were spent restlessly at her bedside&#44; when decay<lb/> drew nigh.  And who can recount adequately picture the an&#45;<lb/>&#45;xiety&#44; the heart&#39;s pangs at the thought that this<lb/> morning&#44; or that night evening might perhaps be the last of the<lb/> object creature loved so intensely&#63;  The hour struck and<lb/> the nearly centenarian mother passed away from the<lb/> scenes which her sons had made fresh and enjoyable.  Joseph<lb/> M. Leon returned from the funeral&#44; which he himself<lb/> had tenderly reverently directed&#44; to lie on the couch of sickness.<lb/>  The precious being&#59; the object of his endless solicitude<lb/> had gone.  That loss was fearfully severe.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>By reason of it&#44; his body refused its functions.  The<lb/> want of food was felt no more.  Walking became grew<lb/> difficult.  Sleep was chased fled away from the eyelids.<lb/>  For a time&#44; I surely believed that the son was doomed<lb/> soon to lie next to his entombed mother.  But<lb/> other cares&#44; fraternal&#44; social and professional&#44; wrought<lb/> a gradual change&#44; and Joseph M. Leon was spared eight<lb/> years longer.  It will not be considered<lb/> an intrusion that I should blend with a funeral ceremony the acknowledgment of my own indebtedness.<lb/>  for a service I deeply appreciate On a sum&#45;<lb/>&#45;mer season&#44; my brother this deservedly praised practitioner&#44; substituting my family physician&#44;<lb/> became&#44; under Providence&#44; the means of saving the life<lb/> of one of my children who suffered with a virulent<lb/> disease.  If the dead have a knowledge of the<lb/> sentiments which the living cherish for them&#44; I trust that<lb/> the spirit of him who now lies enshrouded in this coffin&#44;<lb/> will not be grieved at my public recognition of his skill<lb/> as a practitioner in his prof medical doctor&#44; and his great thoughtful kindness as a man.<lb/>  I had fondly wished that facts in my possession might<lb/> have enabled me also to lay over these mortal remains<lb/> a laurel worn by sweet Charity.  Others beholding<lb/> it would perhaps have it might have also endeavoured to procure it also for themselves that<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>noblest of ornaments by their deeds of philanthropy.<lb/>  But I am left in ignorance of the our brother&#39;s final dispositions&#44; and<lb/> to my regret the distance to which he had lately separated our dwellings moved prevented<lb/> an occasional meeting&#44; who that I might have improved<lb/> on behalf to the benefit of practical religion and humanity.<lb/></p>
            <p>May his heirs propitiate the favor favor grace of the Most High<lb/> towards the spirit soul of Joseph M. Leon.  They can by<lb/> deeds acts of righteousness for in his name&#45;sake behalf draw down<lb/> upon him his memory everlasting graciousness favors blessings.  The soul of the departed<lb/> will be grateful.  For&#44; he now comprehends that mercy is the golden key that which<lb/> opens the gate of the celestial elysium&#59; goodness<lb/> paves the way to blessedness.  Oh may I have<lb/> spoken as a successful advocate of the needy and afflicted distressed&#44;<lb/> and an acceptable petition at the footstool of the throne of grace.<lb/>  May the Universal Lord whose crowning attribute is com&#45;<lb/>&#45;passion pardon the sins which the son of His handmaid<lb/> Esther Leon&#44; committed.  May He bid angles cover up with beneath<lb/> their wings what was defective in his character&#44; and<lb/> grant that as a reward to the social duties he may have per&#45;<lb/>&#45;formed&#44; and to the filial virtues he signally practised&#44; lift up his soul spirit<lb/> shall heavenward to enjoy the association of the pious and the sainted.<lb/></p>
