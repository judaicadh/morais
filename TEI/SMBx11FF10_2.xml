            <p>a funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>My friends&#33;  It is under all circumstances praiseworthy in man<lb/> to bear the trials of life with pious resignation.  It indicates<lb/> a mind possessed of social2 &#38; domestic1 virtues for&#44; he who through&#45;<lb/>out his terrestrial vicissitudes sees the finger of an ever watch&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful Providence&#44; will acquire that a gentleness of character that<lb/> sweetens our intercourse both at home and abroad.  But<lb/> poor humanity is oftentimes exposed to suffering so intensely<lb/> acute&#44; that&#44; although endured without uttering a murmur&#44; yet<lb/> our natural energies will ultimately succumb under them.<lb/>  Bare indeed and therefore exceedingly to be commended is the occa&#45; instance<lb/>&#45;sion when such suffering will not overpower our physical<lb/> and moral strength.  My friends&#33;  Ought we not<lb/> then to bestow a meed of praise upon the venerable being<lb/> whose mortal remains now lie before us&#63;  Mistress Kate Catherine<lb/> Isaacs shared in common with all her fellow&#45;beings many<lb/> tribulations&#44; but what sorrow is like her sorrow&#44; when<lb/> the vital lamp that illumined her path became extinguished&#44;<lb/> and she was surrounded by clouds and ever&#45;enduring darkness&#59;<lb/> thus21 to be cut off from the cheerful ways of man&#44; never to<lb/> behold the vernal bloom&#44; nor the summer&#39;s rose&#44; nor the<lb/> human face divine&#63;  For a the long series of twenty years<lb/></p>

            <p>she was shut out of this our genial and exhilarating invigorating light&#44; but<lb/> the inward light of religion guided her steps.  Her mind<lb/> retained its serenity&#44; her manners lost naught of their suavity.<lb/>  In all the relations of life she uninterruptedly evinced an even<lb/> deportment.  Grateful to the God of mercy&#44; who&#44; in<lb/> her affliction had given her a stay in a beloved husband&#44;<lb/> she tranquilly abode with him&#44; until he preceded her to the<lb/> eternal abode.  Then was her saddened heart&#44; warmed in<lb/> her childs hearth&#44; then she delighted in the growth and<lb/> mental progress of her own descendants.  Thus she<lb/> lived&#44; and when the angel of death approached her couch&#44; she<lb/> whispered but one request.  She would lie close unto him<lb/> who had been her copartner and the joy of her existence.<lb/>  That wish is about to be fulfilled.  He is who solemnly<lb/> promised it&#44; will at this late hour betake himself to a<lb/> neighboring city&#44; there to deposit the bodily tenement of<lb/> our estimable friend into thus its final destination.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; Blessed be he of the Lord&#44; who has not withheld<lb/> his kindness from the living and from the dead.  May<lb/> He pour the balm of divine consolation upon be poured on his bereaved<lb/> household.  May the Almighty grant that the example<lb/> of the righteous mother&#44; inspire th her children with<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>resignation to the his just decrees of Providence.  May He grant<lb/> that when their days are far spent&#44; and their nights are<lb/> at hand&#44; that their posterity may say of each of them what<lb/> we will say of this pious soul &#34;Grace is deceitful&#44; beauty is<lb/> false&#44; but the women who feareth the Lord&#44; she shall be pleased.  He shall enter the dwelling of peace&#44; they shall<lb/> rest upon their beds&#44; who walk in righteousness.&#34;  Amen.<lb/></p>
