            <p>Before &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  Our solemn festivals are approaching&#44; and my<lb/> strength is waning.  I do not say this&#44; as a complaint&#59;<lb/> intimating that the labor imposed on me exceeds human<lb/> strength.  For&#44; I&#44; on the contrary&#44; often reproach myself<lb/> in the secret of my heart&#44; for not having sufficiently exercised<lb/> my energies in the discharge of my religious duties.  And<lb/> I am certain that others might be found who could bring<lb/> to the task greater activity&#59; exhibiting more readiness to<lb/> speak to their hearers with happy results.  But if I refer<lb/> just now to my weakness&#44; proceeding from bodily ailments&#44;<lb/> it is to ask of you a favor&#44; rather than to represent my&#45;<lb/>&#45;self as an individual unduly overtaxed.  I desire that<lb/> you assist me in rendering the Divine Service on the<lb/> new year&#44; and the subsequent holy days of the ensuing<lb/> month&#44; solemn&#44; imposing and edifying to those who<lb/> will come hither to worship the God of Israel.<lb/>  Many portions of the ritual for that season&#44; are pecu&#45;<lb/>&#45;liarly sublime&#44; and the chaunting wherewith they are<lb/> recited&#44; is strikingly impressive.  But to join one&#39;s<lb/> voice loudly and effectively in those portions of our<lb/> service&#44; a fluency in Hebrew reading&#44; and a well trained ear are<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>prerequisites.  Be not offended&#44; dear Brethren&#33; if<lb/> I say&#44; that the absence of those two requirements among<lb/> some of my fellow&#45;worshippers mars at times the solem&#45;<lb/>&#45;nity of the service&#44; and adds to the labor of the Minister.<lb/>  For&#44; the latter&#44; in order to lessen the disagreeable impression<lb/> arising from many jarring voices&#44; is frequently impelled<lb/> to raise his own above all others.  Such has&#44; at all events&#44;<lb/> been my course&#44; and therefore greater exertions than would<lb/> otherwise have been necessary&#44; were its attendants.  But<lb/> now I am physically disabled from doing as heretofore&#59;<lb/> and it would pain me exceedingly if by reason of it&#44;<lb/> the reciting of prayers intended to awaken devotional<lb/> feelings&#44; should create the opposite impression.<lb/></p>
            <p>For I need not assert what is a self&#45;evident truth&#59; namely&#44;<lb/> that external aids are indispensable to exalt the mind of<lb/> man to its Creator.  If all the surroundings at the Syna&#45;<lb/>&#45;gogue are imposing&#59; if in the sanctuary of the Lord<lb/> all speaks of His glory&#44; he who visits it will derive spi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ritual delight and instruction&#59; but if discordance of<lb/> sound and levity of manners prevail in that sacred dwelling&#44;<lb/> then even the noblest outpourings of our poets&#44; and the<lb/> most earnest exhortations of our preachers&#44; will fail to<lb/> evoke religious sentiments.  They will be regarded by as un&#45;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>&#45;meaning utterances.<lb/></p>
            <p>Understand me&#58; I would under no circumstance&#44; deny the<lb/> <sic>worshippers</sic> the privilege of joining in the holy service&#59;<lb/> but the exercise of that privilege should be within the bounds<lb/> of moderation and decorum.  Surely&#44; none of you&#44; my friends&#33;<lb/> will imagine that devotion is best exhibited by loud singing&#44;<lb/> and that you have a right to be heard the last&#44; when by so doing<lb/> harmony is destroyed.  Nor can you suppose&#44; that because you<lb/> do not approve of all which is said from the pulpit&#44; you may<lb/>&#45;&#45;speaking literally&#45;&#45;turn your back on it&#44; and look<lb/> listless.  No&#44; such cannot be your thoughts&#44; and therefore I have come<lb/> in your presence with a request.  Brethren&#33;  Let your chaunting<lb/> of the ritual for the solemn occasions to which I have special<lb/> reference&#44; be soft and concordant.  It greatly depends upon<lb/> you to render it impressive.  Suffer yourselves to be led by the<lb/> Minister&#44; and do not anticipate his reading&#44; nor detain him by<lb/> an undue lengthening of your notes.  So likewise bear<lb/> with him when he addresses the whole audience.  For&#44; impro&#45;<lb/>&#45;priety of demeanour at that time&#44; would be an act of irreverence<lb/> to the house of God&#44; and a detraction from the sanctity of His<lb/> worship.  In a word&#44; my friends&#33;  Grant me your assistance&#44;<lb/> that we may jointly render the approaching season&#44; precisely<lb/> what our Rabbins have called it &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Awe&#45;inspiring&#45;&#45;days&#59;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;.  A month devoted to holiness.<lb/>  But the knowledge that we are recommended by the same Rab&#45;<lb/>&#45;bins to make &#34;charity&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; precede &#34;supplication&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; impels<lb/> me to solicit another favor.  Brethren&#33;  An epidemic that<lb/> rages in a section of this country&#44; has brought untold sor&#45;<lb/>&#45;rows on the Hebrew residents of Galveston.  Among several<lb/> cases of bereavements mentioned in a letter from that city&#44;<lb/> that of a family in needy circumstances&#44; who recently emi&#45;<lb/>&#45;grated there from Europe&#44; is particularly lamentable.<lb/></p>
            <p>The father was seized with the infection and died&#59; his wife soon<lb/> followed him to the grave&#44; and their six orphan children&#44; remain in<lb/> a state of dependence and destitution.  For their sake and for the<lb/> sake of many others&#44; whose wants their small congregation<lb/> <del>cannot</del> is unable to supply&#44; you are appealed to.  As men of deep<lb/> sympathies&#44; you cannot refuse to mitigate the suffering<lb/> of humanity&#59; as Israelites you will not abandon to their sad<lb/> fate those who have with you community of belief and hope.<lb/>  Your representatives have already been petition on behalf of<lb/> the widows and father&#45;less&#44; and you will through them&#44;<lb/> prove your innate feelings of kindliness&#44; and show me also<lb/> favor.  Brethren&#33;  Ere you pour forth entreaties for yourselves<lb/> and dear households on the approaching festivals&#44; pour out gold to<lb/> benefit the indigent&#44; and solace the afflicted.  For&#44; &#34;He that fol&#45;<lb/>&#45;loweth charity and mercy&#44; will obtain life&#44; charity and glory&#34;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
