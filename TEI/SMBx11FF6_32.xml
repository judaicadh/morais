            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Only a few days have passed.  I bent prayfully over the remains of the aged&#44;<lb/> and with the reverence which the hoary head inspire&#44; performed the fune&#45;<lb/>&#45;ral rites.  Only a few days have passed.  I stood beside the coffin<lb/> of a youth.  But for that pallour which overspread his comely face&#44;<lb/> you would have judged that the spring&#45;tide of life ran high still within<lb/> his breast.  I mourned with the bereaved.  Every fibre in my being echoed<lb/> the voice of their lament.  Only a few days have passed.  I<lb/> listened to the impassioned eloquence which grief lends.  Mothers por&#45;<lb/>traying the joy of which death had robbed them&#44; when it snatched<lb/> from their bosoms their darling babes.  All melancholy scenes.<lb/>  Yet&#44; we can turn from them with eyes almost unmoistened with<lb/> tears&#44; when we are made to contemplate this scene&#44; evoking the sad&#45;<lb/>&#45;dest of human emotions.  The home which a wife<lb/> directed&#44; guarded and enlivened with the exhilarating air of cheer&#45;<lb/>&#45;fulness&#44; now abandoned of its guiding spirit.  A numerous<lb/> family&#44; leaning with utter dependence upon the arm of her&#44; who<lb/> formed their stay&#44; early left destitute of maternal support.  A<lb/> husband&#44; whose highest solace amid trials&#44; was the companionship<lb/> of his Adele&#44; doomed to lay into the silent grave what he most<lb/> needed and most valued.<lb/></p>

            <p>They must indeed be hearts of flint that do not melt with pity<lb/> at the calamity which has befallen this household.  Aye&#58; in the<lb/> language of the Sages will I say.  Friends&#33;  We should weep for those who<lb/> lost a precious object&#44; and not for the object lost.  They deserve our com&#45;<lb/>&#45;miseration because privileged no more to enjoy it upon earth&#59; but the<lb/> jewel itself gladdens another sphere by its sparkling brilliancy.<lb/>  Mrs Michael Moyer&#39;s devotion to her duty in the various relations of<lb/> life&#44; and her avowed attachment to the time&#45;honored precepts of our faith&#44;<lb/> will propitiate the race of her beneficent Creator.  To doubt that the<lb/> virtues she possessed&#44; and the kindly deeds she performed while in the<lb/> flesh&#44; will atone for any shortcomings&#44; and purchase the redemption of<lb/> her soul&#44; is to doubt the mercy of God&#59; to ascribe rigour to Him whose<lb/> holy attributes are goodness and compassion.  Our departed friend<lb/> is sheltered under the Rock of all ages.  She fears no evil&#44; for&#44; the<lb/> hand of destruction does not reach where she has been uplifted.<lb/>  But the nine children over whom she kept a vigilant watch&#59; the<lb/> man she inspirited by a love still returning the intensity of its<lb/> primitive glow.  They exposed to the ruthless storms which not un&#45;<lb/>&#45;frequently overtake us by the way.  The constrained to tread the rug&#45;<lb/>&#45;ged path of life&#44; without the light wont to be cast around it.<lb/>  How will they proceed&#63;  Can a wage vacancy be supplied which<lb/> none can fill&#63;......<lb/></p>

            <p>But it ill&#45;becomes a spiritual physician to deepen the wound which<lb/> death has caused.  To add anguish to sorrow.  Let him rather<lb/> strive to bring healing to lacerated hearts&#59; for&#44; such is the mission to<lb/> which he has been called.  Bereaved husband&#33;  Happy off&#45;<lb/>&#45;spring of the deceased&#33;  Sad in the extreme is your lot&#44; yet&#44; you can<lb/> temper its severity.  Close up the gap created in your midst&#44; even like<lb/> brave soldiers&#44; who saw one of their member drop from their rank.<lb/>  Draw your hearts together still more unitedly&#44; that the discharge of the<lb/> obligations devolving upon each of you may become a grateful task.<lb/>  My brother&#44; who have borne your Adele abiding affection&#63;  Strengthen your&#45;<lb/>&#45;self in the thought that she claims at your hands a the fulfilling<lb/> of a twofold charge&#59; that on your readiness to assume it&#44; will depend<lb/> the future of those you desire that might grow up morally and<lb/> religiously good.  Sarah and Clara&#33;  Rise equal to the<lb/> responsible position you must henceforth hold.  Let it be your pleasure<lb/> to lighten the burden beneath which your father bends.  To your<lb/> care has Providence committed the government of this household.<lb/>  Exceeding forbearance and judgment and discretion you will needs exer&#45;<lb/>&#45;cise to conduct it rightly.  But the greater the difficulties you<lb/> shall encounter &#38; overcome by a righteous will&#44; the nobler will be your enchantment&#44;<lb/> and the higher your reward from the all&#45;seeing God.<lb/></p>

            <p>You sons of the departed&#44; who have arrived at an age&#44; enabling you<lb/> to comprehend the extent of your misfortune&#44; let the calamitous event<lb/> change your boyhood into manhood.  Set aside habits which ill comport<lb/> with the state into which you have been placed.  If the unruly entice<lb/> you&#44; consent not.  Your praise&#45;worthy demeanour will relieve to an appre&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciable degree the anxiety your father experiences.  It will encourage your<lb/> elder sisters in the prosecution of their onerous undertaking&#59; and it<lb/> will serve as a pattern&#44; which the younger portion of your family will<lb/> copy to the advantage of all the members thereof.  And you<lb/> relatives and friends of the sorely tried household.  Proffer the offices<lb/> of kindness of goodwill.  Our sacred faith demands you should benefit<lb/> motherless children with your counsel.  The instincts of our race&#44; prompt<lb/> you to allay human suffering.  And you will have most nobly<lb/> responded to the dictates of nature and of nature&#39;s God&#44; when you shall<lb/> have ministered to hearts diseased&#59; when you shall have shown our<lb/> fellow&#45;believer Michael Moyer&#44; a disposition to uplift him from<lb/> his present dejection&#44; and when you shall have succeeded in<lb/> <sic>in</sic> directing his thoughts upward with pious serenity towards her<lb/> who from heaven looks down on her dear ones with a love that<lb/> never dies.<lb/></p>
