            <p>546 N. 5th St<lb/>
                Philadelphia&#44; July 3d&#44; 1889<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. Dr. B. Felsenthal<lb/>
                My Dear Sir<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Your writings&#44; always conveying literary instruction&#44; are read<lb/> by me with pleasure and profit.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>In your contribution to the July number of the <hi rend="underline">Menorah</hi>&#44; you<lb/> take exception at Dr. Zunz&#39;s statement that the Pentateuch was read in olden<lb/> times biennially&#44; as well as annually and triennially.  You say that you<lb/> failed to discover in the meritorious work of the Spanish Jew&#44; the support which<lb/> the German Sage claims to have found.  It strikes me that Dr. Zunz had just cause<lb/> to cite <hi rend="underline">Sepher Ha&#45;Chinnuch</hi> as his authority.  Please&#44; look again and you will<lb/> agree with your great countryman and coreligionist.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>The passage as in Rule 537&#44; runs thus&#58;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>&#34;In all places Israelites read the Scroll of the Law either in one&#44;<lb/> or in two&#44; or&#44; at least in three years.&#34;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>You do not need my endorsement of the observation that a<lb/> triennial cycle was anciently adopted in Palestine&#44; since you have clearly<lb/> learned so from the Babylonian Talmud in Megillah 29.b. and we have moreover<lb/> the testimony of Benjamin of Tudela&#44; the <sic>traveller</sic> of the twelfth century&#44;<lb/> that the same practice was followed everywhere among Palestinian Jews&#44; Still&#44;<lb/> we may pertinently ask&#58; If the biennial cycle was never in use&#44; how could Aaron<lb/> Levy&#44; the author of <hi rend="underline">Sepher Ha&#45;Chinnuchu</hi> cited by Dr. Zunz&#44; have penned the passage<lb/> quoted above&#63;<lb/></p>
                
            <p>This question has recalled to my mind a book&#44; very probably<lb/> known to you&#44; but which&#44; I think&#44; is rather rare.  It was written in the<lb/> Sixteenth century by a certain Issachar Ben Susan of Africa&#44; who titled it<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Tikkun Issachar</hi>.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>The volume has a considerable value to such as yourself&#44;<lb/> so notably interested in the Jewish Calendar and in matters connected with it.<lb/>  But aside from the information it affords on that subject&#44; it gives important<lb/> instruction upon other points.  On page 33 of the edition which I possess<lb/> &#40;Venice 5339&#45;1579&#41; I read as follows&#58; &#34;There are places in the West &#40;Africa&#41;<lb/> where the Section <hi rend="underline">Vaerah</hi> is divided into two......So I heard from learned<lb/> persons and school teachers&#44; who live in Constantina........&#44; in other places<lb/> they divide the section <hi rend="underline">Mikketz</hi> into two......This also I was told by two<lb/> aged scholars and by teachers&#44; as being a settled custom.&#34;  I freely admit<lb/> that the aforesaid does not offer an obvious proof of the existence of a<lb/> biennial cycle&#44; as inferred from <hi rend="underline">Sepher Ha&#45;Chinnuch</hi>&#44; but it might serve as a<lb/> partial support.  Maimonides&#44; though a contemporary of Benjamin of Tudela&#44; and<lb/> acquainted with the custom of perusing the Torah triennially in various localities&#44;<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>seems to deprecate any other usage than an annual recital of the five holy books.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>In fact&#44; our people undertook long ago&#44; with a very general consent&#44;<lb/> to read the Pentateuch in the Synagogue in one year&#44; and that system continued&#44;<lb/> till a comparatively recent time&#44; when the service was subjected to changes.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Now&#44; allow me&#44; in turn&#44; to propound a query&#44; which I asked<lb/> years since&#44; but which was left unanswered.  When was the final division of the<lb/> Parashiyoth &#40;Sioroth&#41; or Pentatuechal sections made and universally accepted&#63;<lb/>  When were the Haftaroth&#44; or Prophetic lessons for the Sabbath ultimately regulated<lb/> with the various differences&#44; as at present&#44; in Sephardic&#44; Ashkenazic and Italian<lb/> rituals&#63;  I notice in Maimonides and elsewhere that some of the Haftaroth recited<lb/> now by Portuguese Jews&#44; were not read by their ancestors in their own days.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Like yourself I say &#34;Torah hee velilmod ani tzarich&#34;&#44; not as<lb/> evolved from the Talmudical narratives to which you allude&#44; but precisely as<lb/> these words tell&#44; namely&#59; it concerns <sic>t he</sic> history of my religion&#44; and I am<lb/> anxious to learn.<lb/></p>
            <p>With high regard for your erudition&#44; I am<lb/> Yours <sic>r espectfully</sic><lb/> S. MORAIS<lb/></p>
