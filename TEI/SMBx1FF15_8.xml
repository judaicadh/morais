                Decr. 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. 1858.<lb/>
                My Respected Friend<lb/></p>
            <p>Altho&#39; I am aware that you have<lb/> refused the application of those whose opinions<lb/> and solicitations must have greater weight in<lb/> guiding your decisions&#44; than <del>might</del> mine can<lb/> possibly have&#44; yet&#44; I am emboldened&#44; to take the<lb/> liberty of exhibiting to you&#44; the effect likely to be<lb/> produced by a <sic>persistance</sic> in your present deter<lb/>mination&#59; as I think I may place the question in a<lb/> point of view&#44; which excitement may have <sic>witheld</sic><lb/> from your perception&#44; and which also may not have<lb/> appeared to those who condemn your line of conduct<lb/> in this matter&#59; You are of course aware that I<lb/> allude to your refusal to recite the prayer for the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Members</hi> of the Government&#44; as you have <hi rend="underline">hitherto done</hi>&#59;<lb/></p>
            <p>We will entirely pass over the omission of it last<lb/> Saturday&#44; &#40;any allusion to which&#44; in the Resolution passed<lb/> on Sunday by the Gentlemen of the Adjunta&#44; has been<lb/> considerately omitted&#41; and merely consider the ques&#45;<lb/>tion of your continuing to say it <hi rend="underline">as hitherto</hi>&#44; that is what<lb/> is desired by the Adjunta&#44; and (believe me when I assure<lb/> you) <hi rend="underline">a very large</hi> majority of the Congregation&#59; In doing<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/> 
            <p>this&#44; your only reflection could be&#44; that you were praying<lb/> for a blessing on a Man or Men who did not deserve it&#59;<lb/> Do any of us deserve the blessings that we supplicate<lb/> our God to bestow on us&#63; If any&#44; I fear but very few.<lb/></p>
            <p>And why should we not pray for a blessing on those<lb/> who act unjustly to us&#63; no blessing can be so great as<lb/> the Divine grace to enlighten us in our errors&#44; to free<lb/> our minds from the torments of prejudice&#44; and enable<lb/> us to look on all men as equally deserving of all the<lb/> enjoyment which this Earth affords&#63; we pray to God to<lb/> &#34;bless&#44; preserve&#44; guard and assist&#34;&#59; with the reservation<lb/> in our minds&#44; that this may be granted for the purpose<lb/> of removing injustice &#38; prejudice from their motives&#44; we<lb/> may surely pronounce this&#44; in favor of our greatest<lb/> enemies&#59; and the closing sentence of the prayer shows<lb/> that this is the main object of it&#44; that they may be<lb/> &#34;inspired with benevolence towards us &#38; all Israel &#38;c.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Again do you inflict any punishment on them<lb/> by <sic>witholding</sic> your prayers&#63; I know you too well to think<lb/> that you suppose by doing so&#44; they will be deprived of the<lb/> Divine grace&#59; therefore if it is the will of the Infinite<lb/> &#38; merciful God to bless them notwithstanding&#44; shall we<lb/> finite creatures&#44; equally sinful ourselves&#44; <sic>withold</sic> our<lb/> prayers that it may be so&#63; or wish &#40;even in our hearts&#41;<lb/> that those blessings we so ardently and de&#91;&#63;&#93;tly supplicate<lb/> for ourselves&#44; shall be <sic>witheld</sic> from others&#63;</p>
            <p>And now setting aside all argument&#44; grounded on<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/> 
            <p><sic>Brothely</sic>&#59; I will use a more selfish one&#44; merely to<lb/> strengthen my position &#38; not with the hope that it will<lb/> be more cogent.  You are aware that the Adjunta<lb/> can suspend you from office&#44; which would be only a step to<lb/> discharge&#45;it is true that perhaps the latter cannot be done<lb/> but by the cong. but you <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that the Board and com&#45;<lb/>mand a majority to any measure that their wisdom<lb/> may induce them to think correct&#44; and believe me when<lb/> I sincerely assure you&#44; that the majority in this case would not<lb/> be wanting&#44; altho&#39; you were &#40;I believe&#41; unanimously elected<lb/> by them for the next 5 years&#44; such is the general feeling on<lb/> this question &#40;not the past&#41; that they would all be up in<lb/> arms against what they would consider an act of con&#45;<lb/>tumacy.  And let me ask you Sir&#44; are you prepared for that&#63;<lb/>  Are you prepared to be suddenly hurled from a position of<lb/> pecuniary independence&#44; of domestic comfort&#44; in which<lb/> you are enabled to earn the means of support for yourself<lb/> &#38; those you love&#44; to one of unrequited labor&#44; in which you<lb/> might find it difficult to earn a pittance sufficient for<lb/> their bare support&#44; for well you know that talent is<lb/> but poorly rewarded.  You are also strengthening &#34;the hands<lb/> of your enemies&#34; for your perseverance in your present<lb/> decision will unquestionably drive several members to<lb/> leave our Synagogue&#44; &#38; we know where it is likely they will<lb/> go to&#59; this I say advisedly&#44; &#38; not as more conjecture&#59;<lb/></p>
            <p>May I dare hope that your good sense will have<lb/> led you to come to the determination to act in accordance<lb/> with the wishes of the adjunta and a large majority<lb/> of the congregation&#63;  I most sincerely and devoutly pray<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/> 
            <p>that such may be&#44; for I can hardly think that what<lb/> I have addressed can have sufficient weight&#44; after the in&#45;<lb/>efficacy of the persuasion of your other friends.  At any<lb/> rate I have performed what I considered a duty&#44; and I trust<lb/> you will excuse me on that score &#38; not consider that I have<lb/> been officious.  I could add much to this&#44; but will<lb/> not occupy your time by adding to what I consider the<lb/> strongest reasons I could adduce for your changing your<lb/> present position.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am Sir<lb/>
                Yours most sincerely<lb/>
                &#38; Respectfully<lb/>
                A. Finsi<lb/>
                You will much oblige me by destroying this after<lb/> you have read it<lb/></p>
