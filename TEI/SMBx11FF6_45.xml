            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>It would be cruel in me to add intensity to the sorrow which<lb/> weighs down a bereaved household.  The mere mention of her&#44;<lb/> who lies enshrouded within this coffin&#44; would rack and tear<lb/> a heart&#44; already overwhelmed with domestic trials.  The duty<lb/> of God&#39;s servants is to sit by the side of those who mourn&#44;<lb/> and pour soothing drops into the soul form a cup of consola&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion.  Still too fresh is the wound in the present melan&#45;<lb/>&#45;choly instance&#59; too stunning&#44; because so sudden&#44; is the<lb/> blow&#44; that I may hope to bring in healing and chase away<lb/> anguish.  Time&#44; the agent of Mercy&#44; and pious me&#45;<lb/>&#45;diatations can aid me&#44; after this paroxysm of pain<lb/> shall be over&#44; in working out&#44; a devout resignation to<lb/> the will of a Supreme Ruler&#59; a reconciliation to the<lb/> shifting scenes of this perishable earth.<lb/></p>
            <p>But the duty of God&#39;s servants is also to instruct&#59;<lb/> to allow no occasion to go unimproved&#44; when he<lb/> can benefit the living by pointing even to the dead.<lb/>  And I honestly believe that my lamented coreligionist&#44;<lb/> whom we are about to consign to the grave&#44; may rightly<lb/> be taken as a pattern of unobtrusive yet startling virtues.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>To her a widowed mother turned&#44; and not in vain&#44;<lb/> for efficient help&#44; and for a sensible interchange of<lb/> thoughts in the government of home&#44; and of the tem&#45;<lb/>&#45;poral affairs which the untimely decease of the<lb/> head of the family had entailed.  A gentle messen&#45;<lb/>&#45;ger was she&#44; in the hour of need&#44; whose presence restored<lb/> calmness and urged harmony.  Perla Nathans possessed<lb/> qualities redeeming in their character&#59; atoning for trespasses failings<lb/> inherent in her nature&#59; Obedience to superiors&#44; friendliness to<lb/> neighbors&#44; amiability to strangers&#44; kindness and thought&#45;<lb/>&#45;fulness.  I may be told that filial devotion&#44; deserves<lb/> no special priase&#59; that to be affectionate as a sister&#44;<lb/> attached as a companion&#44; considerate towards the<lb/> unfortunate&#44; should not call forth a eulogy.  Aye&#58;<lb/> my hearers&#33;  We all have learnt by rote the command&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments which religion and civilized society impose.<lb/>  But are we all so faithful in their performance&#44; that<lb/> to pass any remarks upon the conduct of one who fulfilled<lb/> the same becomes useless&#63;  Are there not&#44; on the con&#45;<lb/>trary&#44; many children even among those to whose an&#45;<lb/>&#45;cestors the Decalogue was taught at Sinai&#44;<lb/> who slight&#44; if they do not provokingly oppose the parental<lb/> will&#63;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Many who treat their equals with contempt&#44; and<lb/> look upon the needy and unhappy with a pitiless<lb/> eye&#63;  If I respond to my own promptings and to a<lb/> desire expressed and bestow a meed of <sic>encomum</sic> upon<lb/> this lamented sister in faith&#44; it is because she deemed it<lb/> not only an obligation but a privilege to be found<lb/> at the bedside of the sick&#44; at the house of the afflicted.<lb/>  You who now listen to my words&#44; testify to their truth&#45;<lb/>&#45;fulness.  For you have surrounded this coffin to show<lb/> sympathy for a loss which a mother in Israel can barely<lb/> sustain&#44; but also to tell the bereaved that the name<lb/> which the deceased won by her unaustentatious virtues<lb/> must be relief to poignant sorrow&#59; a sweet me&#45;<lb/>&#45;morial to the survivors&#44; an incentive to goodness to<lb/> every one whom she held dear.  Oh&#33; may you be so<lb/> comforted and instructed.  May the Almighty who<lb/> tries us in the crucible of suffering to purify our exist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ence&#44; and fit us for His heavenly association hereafter&#44;<lb/> support you in this sad hour of separation.  May<lb/> He vouchsafe to hearken unto my prayer&#44; and let<lb/> you feel serenely resigned and religiously exalted.<lb/>  &#40;Here follows a prayer&#41;.<lb/></p>
