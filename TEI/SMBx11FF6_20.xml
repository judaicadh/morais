            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Fellow Israelites.  You will forgive an act of selfishness.  I know<lb/> it.  It is unbecoming to speak of oneself when our thoughts ought<lb/> to be altogether directed to do honor to the departed&#44; and to comfort the<lb/> mourners.  But I have a strong wish to make a confession in your<lb/> presence.  Hear it.  I belong to a class of men&#44; who pay the greatest reve&#45;<lb/>&#45;rence to one only object upon earth&#44; and that is religious consistency.<lb/>  I do not deny the merit due to learning&#44; any more than I would refuse to<lb/> recognize the worth of riches.  Knowledge is deserving of praise&#44; when&#45;<lb/>&#45;ever it aims at the instruction of the illiterate&#44; and the elevation<lb/> of the lowly&#44; just as wealth must call draw elicit forth our commendation when it<lb/> flows into the channels of charity and largehearted goodness.  But<lb/> so apt is he whom we commonly style &#34;smart&#34; to swell with pride&#44;<lb/> and look down with contempt upon other creatures less gifted&#59; it so<lb/> very often happens that persons who have gathered gold become so haughty<lb/> and overbearing in their behaviour&#44; that both learning and riches are regarded<lb/> by me always with some misgivings&#44; while religious consistency commands<lb/> my unqualified resource.  Now&#58; because that principle which I have confessed is my stan&#45;<lb/>&#45;dard therefore I have presented myself before you&#44; therefore have I agreed at<lb/> once to perform the funeral obsequies of my respected departed deceased sister in faith.<lb/>  I felt that depending on general opinion and consent prefore personal observation&#44; my lips would not be soiled with rank falsehood&#59; that my conscience<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>would not be ill at ease within me&#44; if I said that Henrietta Meyers<lb/> was a model of a Jewess.  Must I define my meaning&#63;  I shall.<lb/>  She did not consider it a sacrifice to undergo fatigue or privations for<lb/> the sake of that Law&#44; which she believed to have proceeded from the Wisest<lb/> Being&#44; as a guide to the covenant&#45;people.  But no&#44; I did not express myself<lb/> sufficiently well.  She considered deemed it a privilege and a pleasure to do so<lb/> at any cost&#59; to perform the dictates of the heavenly Legislator.  though<lb/> every day claimed her attention to sacred duties&#44; she greeted the Sabbath seventh with<lb/> a welcome that betokened her devotion to the Word of inspiration.  And she<lb/> dedicated that day to the worship of Him in whom her hopes for blessedness<lb/> here and hereafter were centred.  She never thought that she had out&#45;<lb/>&#45;grown the teachings imbibed in early days years.  She did not reason herself&#44; into like too<lb/> many of us&#44; into an abandonment of those dietary rules which&#44; during long<lb/> ages of suffering in unhealthy and shut up quarters&#44; wonderfully preserved<lb/> our national existence.  She did not allow the idea to harbor in her mind to harbor the idea that in<lb/> this land of freedom she was exempt from the duty obligation of joining the humblest lowliest<lb/> of her coreligionists in supplications and abstinence when solemn seasons<lb/> arrived.  What she professed&#44; she exemplified by deeds&#44; and that not with the<lb/> ostentation of the would be righteous&#44; seeking to attract&#44; but with that retiring<lb/> modesty so highly esteemed by our prophet&#44; who in the section of yesterday<lb/> asked us to walk humbly before our God.  Such were the character&#45;<lb/>istics traits of my model&#45;Jewess.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>But greatly as I do value them&#44; I would not have detained you with their<lb/> recital&#44; if nothing more nought else I could have said of Henrietta Myers than that she<lb/> observed the ceremonial ordinances of her religion Judaism.  Had she thought much<lb/> of the Sabbath&#44; and nothing of those who need not to their weary limbs&#59;<lb/> much of the lawfully prepared victuals&#44; and nothing of creatures who<lb/> cry for food&#59; much of the habitation of prayer&#44; and nothing of the<lb/> dwelling of creatures who affliction misery&#44; I would have withheld my eulogy.  For I<lb/> remember that there exists a Universal Father whose companionship<lb/> we must crave for and we we can obtain not alone by a religion of obedience which affords time<lb/> us alone satisfaction and habits have endeared to ourselves&#44; but by that principally which is fruitful of blessings to others.<lb/>  Well then&#58; let me say that the first time occasion on which I met our lamented friend<lb/> it was when she saw fit to apply to me about the discharge of a<lb/> mission of mercy.  Since that have occasion on which time I heard of her again and again&#44; where<lb/> distress had entered&#44; found her where grief had a lodging place&#44; and<lb/> recognized her presence where tears required wiping away.  for kind<lb/> she was and gentle&#44; even towards those who differed.  Many may<lb/> have given largely of their means&#44; but not more thoughtfully considerately many<lb/> may have visited the distressed afflicted&#44; but not with deeper sympathy than<lb/> my lamented friend the now departed her now departed from our midst.  Therefore you all have gathered to do her honor&#44; and<lb/> in accord of sentiments with myself hold that the Biblical sentence<lb/> in the book of Proverbs is truly applicable to her.  &#34;Grace is deceitful&#44;<lb/> and beauty is vain&#59; the woman that feareth the Lord&#44; she shall be praised.&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>But in the same splendid chapter which closes our holy<lb/> volume of morals we also read&#58; &#34;Her children rise and call her<lb/> blessed&#59; her husband also and he extols her virtues.&#34;  Yes&#44; son<lb/> and daughters of Henrietta Meyers.  You will now and always pronounce<lb/> the name of your mother with a benediction on your lips.  Educated by her<lb/> example not less than by her precept&#44; you will more closely than heretofore<lb/> abide by her will.  I can bear testimony to your filial attachment&#44; and I<lb/> rejoice because your keen sorrow is the effect of your profound appreciation<lb/> of the loos sustained in the death of that mother.  Cherish the memory of<lb/> her qualities&#44; and strive to copy them with fidelity.  You shall gladden her soul&#44; and<lb/> become secure for yourselves beatitude.  For you who have been left with&#45;<lb/>out the association of her whom you rightly extolled&#44; of her you needed as a<lb/> sweet copartner in the autumn of your life&#44; I have but commiseration. My<lb/> words are powerless.  Him you must seek who has wounded&#44; but who alone<lb/> can heal.  In pious resignation&#44; in acts of godliness&#44; and in the spirit of<lb/> reverence instilled by the Almighty into your children&#44; you will gradually<lb/> see the opening of a source of consolation.  And thou our consistently religious<lb/> sister in faith whom hast been summoned from amidst these transitory angels gently kissed eternal rest&#44; thou who hast been quickly<lb/> scenes to be transferred in wafted almost the serene regions of lasting joys&#44; farewell.<lb/>  The glory in heaven is the contemplation of the Almighty all&#45;saving Lord&#44; whom<lb/> Thou hast adored&#44; but thy name will still be remain fragrant on earth<lb/> with the remembrance of thy righteous deeds.<lb/></p>
