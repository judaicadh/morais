            <p>Monday morning<lb/>
                Feb 12&#47;94<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear Father&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>After the most<lb/> earnest consideration&#44; we have<lb/> decided to let Leon go to Kansas<lb/> City.  During the three weeks<lb/> of his stay we have thought<lb/> constantly of what to do&#44; and have<lb/> discussed the matter together<lb/> and with him.  It is useless<lb/> to tell you of the many plans<lb/> made and rejected and of the<lb/> reasons<lb/> you already know&#44; and the<lb/> many considerations pro and con<lb/> for sending him here or<lb/> there&#44; or for paying any or<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>all of his debts.<lb/></p>
            <p>It seems to me now that<lb/> he has awakened to some sense<lb/> of the great wrong that he<lb/> has done&#44; and is determined<lb/> with all his power to make<lb/> any other effort.  He feels<lb/> <sic>assurred</sic>&#44; I think&#44; from<lb/> the way in which Manuel<lb/> has spoken to him&#44; that<lb/> while he will be assisted<lb/> in sincere efforts to get work&#44;<lb/> if he does any wrong&#44; he<lb/> will not be assisted&#44; no<lb/> matter how much we<lb/> may suffer.  Manuel has<lb/> spoken to him severely&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>but justly&#44; and though the circumstances<lb/> were such that his visit here could not<lb/> be a happy one&#44; I believe that it has done<lb/> him good and that he appreciates it.<lb/>  I am very glad that we took him&#59; he<lb/> has behaved well and has been as useful<lb/> as possible.  He will leave us about Wednesday.<lb/>  We have decided to let him go to Kansas<lb/> City for these reasons.<lb/></p>
            <p>I It is his <hi rend="underline">choice</hi>&#44; for he believes that<lb/> he could more readily get work there&#59;<lb/> and by doing so retrieve his reputation<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>where he lost it.<lb/></p>
            <p>II If he could begin again unhampered<lb/> by creditors&#44; he would have more courage<lb/> to face the fight.<lb/></p>
            <p>III Gambling houses are everywhere&#44; and he<lb/> believes that he will not be tempted again<lb/> I will add that he has no <hi rend="underline">bad friends</hi> in<lb/> K. C. but his errors are his own.<lb/></p>
            <p>Since the debts must be paid ulti&#45;<lb/>mately&#44; and we all are in earnest about<lb/> giving him another chance&#44; we think<lb/> that we should give it to him freely<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>that is in the way <hi rend="underline">he</hi><lb/> thinks best&#44; so that he<lb/> may feel that all possible has<lb/> been done for him and<lb/> he takes the whole res<lb/>ponsibility of his future<lb/> once again.<lb/></p>
            <p>I trust&#44; my dear Father&#44;<lb/> that you will agree with<lb/> this decision.  It has<lb/> been a <hi rend="underline">terrible responsibility</hi><lb/> but he had in mind under<lb/> all <hi rend="underline">only</hi> his and your best<lb/> good.  My husband&#39;s good&#45;<lb/>ness wisdom and forbearance<lb/> in this matter has endeared<lb/> him still more to me&#44; who<lb/> always appreciated his worth.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>In accordance with<lb/> your proposition to<lb/> Leon his debts will<lb/> be settled at once.<lb/>  You have already<lb/> given me &#36;100 and<lb/> sent him in Chicago &#36;42<lb/> Besides this he owes<lb/> &#36;358.  This sum includes<lb/> a note for &#36;105&#44; for<lb/> which Manuel is security.<lb/>  This note may be<lb/> paid now&#44; or it<lb/> can wait until July<lb/> 18&#44; when &#36;5 more<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>for interest will be due.  Leon&#39;s<lb/> note to you will then be<lb/> 
                For money sent to Nina&#45;&#45;&#36;100<lb/>
