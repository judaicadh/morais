            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Oct. 23&#44; 92<lb/></p>
            <p>Doubtless&#44; there are here gloomy shadows here but to my<lb/> vision there appear also bright rays&#44; even res&#45;<lb/>&#45;plendent.  To part with a dear loving father&#44;<lb/> though he be aged and feeble&#44; is a cause of dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;tress.  To bid the last farewell to a dear companion&#44;<lb/> with whom we have walked through the path<lb/> of life for upward of half a century&#44; is a cause<lb/> of affliction.  But how greatly is the grief <sic>ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;peazed</sic> of by the consciousness of having peacefully<lb/> lengthened in peace the existence&#8212;whose termination on earth<lb/> we lament&#8212;by a filial and conjugal devotion&#44; unsur&#45;<lb/>&#45;assed&#33;  The wife who could best appreciate her<lb/> husband&#39;s past history in its various phases&#59; the<lb/> wife who long shared his joys and his sorrows&#44; she who knew&#44;<lb/> how&#44; after of a series of changes&#44; now inspiring glowing<lb/> hopes&#44; against occasioning sad disappointments&#44; she the wife<lb/> I say&#44; who knew how J. N&#44; having stepped beyond<lb/> the bounds generally assigned to mortality&#44; needed every<lb/> comfort which <sic>unremmitting</sic> attention can procure&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>must feel unutterably consoledion at the contempla&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of all that she did to prolong the his days of her husbands in ease<lb/> and calm repose.  And the daughters&#8212;and I humbly<lb/> crave not to be considered offensively partial&#8212;the<lb/> daughters of J. N. who&#44; as it is but natural&#44; associated<lb/> most intimately in home life with their patriarchal<lb/> parent&#59; the daughters carry in the depth of their hearts<lb/> a source of exhaustless consolation.  They have illus&#45;<lb/>&#45;trated the fifth commandment of the Decalogue beauti&#45;<lb/>fully&#44; for they brought to bear on the performance of<lb/> the Divine injunction industry and watchful care&#44; sooth&#45;<lb/>ing consideration&#44; and the refinement of culture.  When<lb/> I open the book of Proverbs&#44; which to my mind&#44; contains<lb/> the quintessence of ethical teaching&#44; I can read the inspi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ration of its author&#44; as he uses the feminine gender<lb/> to personify&#44; wisdom and goodness.  For&#44; without<lb/> disparaging the masculine male sex&#44; recognizing on<lb/> the contrary&#44; the incalculable advantages derived from<lb/> from those belonging to the male sex&#44; men&#39;s exertions advantages of<lb/> social&#44; political and religious character&#44; I am never&#45;<lb/>&#45;theless impelled to extol woman&#39;s virtues that heighten<lb/> man&#39;s burdens by sharing them unmurmuringly&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>and remove the weight of business troubles by gentle<lb/> counsel and self denying affection.<lb/></p>
            <p>Happy was my venerable coreligionist in having the enjoyment of such<lb/> surroundings at all times&#44; but specially during a stage<lb/> of existence&#44; when we stand most in need of tokens of<lb/> love that sweeten the soul.  I verily believe that<lb/> if the lips now sealed in death could move and speak<lb/> again as in the days of old&#44; they would utter breathe words of<lb/> recognition and of blessing.  They would tell wife and<lb/> children that to indulge in lamentations is ingratitude<lb/> to God&#44; that the bereaved should&#44; in this instance&#44; give<lb/> thanks to the Almighty for having endowed them with<lb/> a full measure of praiseworthy qualities&#44; with a<lb/> vast capacity to make the protracted winter of his a good<lb/> father &#38; husband&#39;s life as bright and gladsome as&#44; under cir&#45;<lb/>&#45;cumstances&#44; could be possibly rendered.  I&#44; inter&#45;<lb/>&#45;preting the sentiments of the imparadised departed&#44;<lb/> exhort the mourners to look up serenely&#8212;I need not<lb/> say resignedly&#8212;upon this terrestrial separation&#59; to cling<lb/> together&#44; as always&#44; in unbroken attachment and mutual<lb/> devotion&#44; supported by consolatory piety&#44; joyful in the<lb/> belief that when our flesh moulders in the grave&#44; God<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>is still our spiritual Redeemer Protector and sole Saviour.<lb/></p>
            <p>Gracious art Thou O God Lord and most compassion&#45;<lb/>&#45;ate.  Thou didst vouchsafe to make Thy servant J N<lb/> the recipient of Thy signal favors in his declining<lb/> years&#44; that he might be compensated for sore trials<lb/> which he bore in earlier days.  We acknowledge<lb/> Thy heavenly benefactions.  Grant that those who<lb/> experience a void in their midst&#44; through the<lb/> decease of a cherished husband and a father&#44; may be upheld<lb/>  by Thy mercy and strengthened in their endea&#45;<lb/>&#45;vours to still obey Thy revealed will.  Com&#45;<lb/>&#45;fort the sorrowful everywhere&#44; and teach us all<lb/> to lean upon Thee for support&#44; when we feel as if<lb/> ready to fall under burdens of trials&#44; disappointments<lb/> and sorrows.  Pardon our sins&#44; as Thou wilt for&#45;<lb/>&#45;give the trespasses of our brother&#44; whose spirit soul has<lb/> been ushered before Thy presence.  And hasten the<lb/> time in which the promise of Thy prophet will<lb/> be fulfilled.  &#8220;The Lord God will wipe off the tears from<lb/> all eyes&#44; and the reproach of His people He will take<lb/> away from all the earth.&#8221;  Amen<lb/></p>
