            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>If I understand my mission rightly&#45;&#45;and my<lb/> one Great Master be at my right hand&#44; that I<lb/> do not fall short in duty&#45;&#45;the main object<lb/> I should hold in view when in the presence of<lb/> the dead&#44; is to console the sorrowing living.  Unless<lb/> the qualities of heart and mind which adorned<lb/> the character of the departed were of a character nature to stri&#45;<lb/>&#45;king as to have left their impress upon large com&#45;<lb/>&#45;munities or single congregations&#44; a rehearsal thereof<lb/> would be more of a reflection on the survivors&#44; than of<lb/> a panegyric on the deceased.  Thus&#44; to deal with in&#45;<lb/>tegrity while in the pursuit of a competence&#44; is not<lb/> a special claim to a eulogy.  I know too well&#44;<lb/> that many are unscrupulous in their commercial in&#45;<lb/>&#45;tercourse&#44; feeling no hesitation to wrong or deceive<lb/> in their eagerness to amass wealth.  But will it be<lb/> representing our brother&#44; who has changed the mortal<lb/> for the immortal&#44; as an exceptional man&#44; to say to those<lb/> who surround his mortal remains&#44; Dr H. Solis did not<lb/> defraud&#44; or overreach&#59; he was honest in his dealings&#63;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I am glad for the sake of his happiness&#44; to be<lb/> positively told&#44; that in answer to the first question&#44;<lb/> which will be put&#44; the spirit of our brother can<lb/> point to its cleanness as its own witness.  For&#44;<lb/> according to our Sages&#44; on entering the celestial<lb/> tribunal&#44; the Great infallible judge asks forthwith<lb/> &#34;Didst thou keep my eighth commandment&#44; didst<lb/> thou deal with probity&#63;&#34;  Again&#58; In this age<lb/> of utilitarianism&#44; when religious principles are often<lb/> sacrificed on the altar of material gain&#44; some may<lb/> deem the observance of the fourth commandment of<lb/> the Decalogue a special title to a panegyric.  So<lb/> general is the practice among the coheirs of the Sinaic<lb/> covenant to follow their usual vocations on the<lb/> Sabbath&#44; and publicly to remain at their desk<lb/> or counting&#45;house or counter on the holy days of the<lb/> Lord&#44; that abstention from that offence against the<lb/> Law&#44; might be considered a singular virtue.  May it<lb/> never become such.  May the time never arrive&#44; when a<lb/> servant of Israel&#39;s God shall be called upon to heap<lb/> encomiums on a son of Israel&#44; because while he<lb/> lived he did not defiantly trampled upon the word of the<lb/></p>

            <p>Sovereign Legislator.  As to him&#44; who&#44; I am assured by his<lb/> intimate acquaintances&#44; had always withdrawn himself from<lb/> the busy marts of trade on the seventh day &#38; the festivals the prophet Isaiah is his guarantee<lb/> for the enjoyment of a heavenly reward &#34;If thou turn thy foot<lb/> away on because of the Sabbath....then shalt thou delight with the Lord.&#34;<lb/>  It has also been reported to me since his demise&#44; that our<lb/> brother&#39;s deeds of beneficence were not rare&#59; that they were stu&#45;<lb/>&#45;diously concealed from all&#59; that to avoid notoriety&#44; he purposely<lb/> declined having his name inscribed where it would figure in public<lb/> records.  Had I even personal knowledge of the fact connected with<lb/> each instance when Charity was so thoughtfully bestowed&#44; I would<lb/> not dwell upon that which D. H. S desired to hide from the<lb/> world.  Enough that our sainted teachers of old&#44; commenting<lb/> on the well known sentence of the book of Proverbs &#34;a gift in secret<lb/> pacifies anger&#44;&#34; asserted that it will appease also Divine wrath<lb/> and <sic>protitiate</sic> divine Grace.  No&#58; the departed one stands not in<lb/> need of my poor praise&#44; nor would my hearers approve of my<lb/> setting forth his character as exceptional in the moral and religious<lb/> relations of life&#44; lest &#91;&#63;&#93; my utterances be interpreted as an intimation of their<lb/> failure in duty.  The Almighty Creator will apportion to His servant<lb/> the due share due to his actions will while he trod this nether path&#59; ac&#45;<lb/>cording to what is written in the book of books &#34;God will bring every work<lb/> into judgment&#44; with every secret thing&#44; whether it be good&#44; or whether it be evil.&#34;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>But those whom D. H. Solis left on earth to bemoan his loss&#44; specially<lb/> the companion of his pleasures but also of his sore trials&#44; now discon&#45;<lb/>solate&#44; ought to be lifted from the depth of sorrow.  With<lb/> her and with them you and I sincerely sympathise&#44; as fellow<lb/> creatures and fellow believers.  Fortunately&#44; I can speak to her the<lb/> heart of her our brother&#39;s widow &#38; awaken sentiments&#44; which will prove a<lb/> soothing balm.  My knowledge of her home training&#44; and of her married life<lb/> devotedly consecrated to the performance of conjugal and maternal obligations&#44;<lb/> inspires me with the belief that she accepts this visitation with humbleness<lb/> of spirit.  I bear the conviction that leaning on the arm of the omnipotent<lb/> the relict of our coreligionists will be upheld in piety.  For trusting in that Being<lb/> who suffers nothing to end the destruction&#44; she looks upon the  body&#44; which<lb/> dissolves itself into its primitive elements&#44; as the receptacle of that which<lb/> quickened it&#44; and which is by its nature indivisible and imperishable.<lb/>  In like manner as the eternity of God is her creed&#44; so is the everlastingness of the soul<lb/> her sustaining hope.  Might Would that I could thus infuse into all her child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren the feelings which pervade the hearts of the wife and sisters of my lamented<lb/> coreligionist.  Oh that his loss might be in each one among the offspring of D. H. Solis a gain to Judaism and society&#59; a<lb/> laver in which whatever is imperfect is cleansed away&#59; a crucible<lb/> in which dross is purified.  The mother would rejoice&#59; the father<lb/> feel beatified&#44; a congregation of Israel derive advantages&#59; the community<lb/> of Phila benefit greatly.  Thou O Lord canst supply my deficiencies.  Thou<lb/> canst cause even a small seed of righteousness to fructify&#44; the least germ<lb/> of perfection to blossom and grow luxuriant.  Deign to bless every thought leading onward &#38;<lb/> upwards.  &#40;Here followed a prayer&#41;<lb/></p>
