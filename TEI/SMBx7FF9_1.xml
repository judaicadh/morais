            <p>Philadelphia&#44; January 7&#44; 1896.<lb/></p>
            <p>Honorable Joseph Blumenthal&#44;<lb/>
                My dear Sir&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>The letter which you handed to me this morning&#44; I have<lb/> read with the deep interest which it commands.  Allow me to speak<lb/> confidentially as I feel.  The youthful correspondent is an enthusiast.<lb/>  No one more than I is conscious of the great difficulties under which<lb/> we labor.  It would be idle to repeat what you know well.  The choice<lb/> of the person&#44; who has become most objectionable was not my choice.<lb/>  What we need&#44; even more than learning&#44; is character&#44; manners&#44; the<lb/>  capacity to inspire love for whatever is loveable in the literature<lb/> of our Bible and post biblical writings.  To try our very best to<lb/> procure that desideratum&#44; a change is absolutely demanded.  I am<lb/> alive to other defects&#44; but the evil to which I have just hinted&#44; must<lb/> positively be remedied.  Now&#44; regarding the propositions submitted to<lb/> your decision.  The first named scholar&#44; highly recommended&#44; I re&#45;<lb/>cognize as one possessed of vast erudition&#44; but I have had occasion<lb/> to express my views touching his qualifications as head and front<lb/> of the work which we have undertaken.  The young man who would re&#45;<lb/>luctantly leave his present position&#44; but who nevertheless &#34;is<lb/> waiting for your orders&#34;&#44; may be <sic>everthing</sic> as described&#44; but sup&#45;<lb/>pose he is not&#44; what would the issue be&#63;  Again&#58; &#34;An essay on innate<lb/> ideas in Descartes&#44;&#34; may have been declared by competent authorities<lb/> excellent&#44; but after all&#44; it is not philosophy which we particularly<lb/> aim to impart.  The Spirit of Holy Writ&#44; the traditions based upon a<lb/> sound understanding of Holy Writ is what we must teach dispassionately<lb/> logically&#44; truthfully.  I have not the means to ascertain how far we<lb/> might be justified to place a youth&#44; entirely unknown to us&#44; in a<lb/> position of great responsibilities.  I might inquire of Dr. Hildesheimer<lb/> but he belongs to the School that our friend&#44; would not deem acceptable.<lb/>  I am not inclined to venture and for the sake of gaining a name abroad<lb/> destroy the little good&#44; which I hope and trust will still spring from<lb/> our midst.  It has been our misfortune not to be able to engage the<lb/> services of a superintendent fit for the situation.  This must be<lb/> filled by a person who combines with the knowledge of household af&#45;<lb/>fairs&#44; a kindly disposition and a degree of ability to teach&#44; in<lb/> case of necessity.<lb/></p>
            <p>Being in N.Y. today&#44; I noticed for instance&#44; that the provision to<lb/> keep the building as the state of the weather required&#44; was not made.<lb/>  Another deficit that I discovered&#44; is the want of attendance on the<lb/> part of the Preparatory Class to the Saturday evening Session&#44; de&#45;<lb/>voted to Biblical history.  In fact&#44; while I am not disposed to agree<lb/> with the painful impression&#44; entertained by some&#44; namely&#44; that we<lb/> have altogether bad materials&#44; I am free to acknowledge&#44; like one of<lb/> our directors&#44; that with a single exception&#44; the Preparatory must be<lb/> altogether abolished.  Often we have realized the imperative need<lb/> of a supervision on the part of the Trustees&#44; who are within reach of<lb/> the institution.  Pupils and their instructors must feel that they are<lb/> watched.  But aside from that thought&#44; which is not indeed to the<lb/> credit of either&#44; the idea that the directors have the interest of<lb/> the institution at heart&#44; must act as an incentive for good.  A number<lb/> of the students&#44; who undergo at this season examination in secular<lb/> b<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>branches&#44; begged that they may be permitted to absent themselves from<lb/> the Sessions at the Seminary&#44; during two weeks&#44; from next Monday.<lb/>  They asserted with positive assurance&#44; that unless the absence is<lb/> granted&#44; their failure in secular branches will follow.  I must un&#45;<lb/>willingly grant the request.<lb/>  Yours very truly&#44;<lb/> S. Morais.<lb/></p>
