            <p>San Francisco July 23d 1874.<lb/>
            Revd. S. Morais<lb/>
            Dear Sir.<lb/>
                Your interesting letter of 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst. came duly to hand<lb/> and I reply thereto&#44; though I have not had much time to hand up matter<lb/> to cont&#91;&#63;&#93; your arguments&#44; which did not satisfy me in regard to the matter at<lb/> issue.  The subject is so vast I hardly know where to take hold of it&#44; to com&#45;<lb/>mence my reply.  I take it from your letter&#44; that you think it the <hi rend="underline">original tongue</hi>&#44;<lb/> and this is the idea of not only Jews but also many Christians&#44; for instance&#44; Chrysostom&#44;<lb/> Austin&#44; Origin and Jerome among the Ancient writers&#44; and among the moderns&#44; Bo&#45;<lb/>chart&#44; Heidegger&#44; seldin and Buxtorf.  They employ the argument you do&#44; viz&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Adam</hi> from <hi rend="underline">Adamah</hi> &#40;the ground&#41; &#38;c  It is said those are plainly Hebrew names &#38;<lb/> therefore prove the Hebrew language to have been in use when they were given.  Besides<lb/> it is alleged the names of some nations are derived from Hebrew names&#58; as Sonia&#44; from<lb/> Savan&#58; and so likewise of some heathen gods&#59; as &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; which seems to be a corruption of<lb/> Tubal&#45;Cain&#59; as Apollo does of Jubal &#38;c. &#38;c.  But &#91;&#63;&#93; and many others will not<lb/> allow this argument.  On this head I find in &#34;Jennings Jewish Antiquities&#34; Edinburgh<lb/> edition 1808. &#34;There are many more patriarchal names&#44; of which we can find <hi rend="underline">no such<lb/> Hebrew derivation</hi>&#44; than there are of which we can&#59; and it might very likely happen&#44; that<lb/> among such a multitude of names&#44; some few might answer to the word&#44; which expressed<lb/> the sense of that original word from whence the name was derived&#44; in whatever language<lb/> Moses had written.  Thus&#44; supposing he had written in Latin&#44; and accordingly translated<lb/> the name Adam into <hi rend="underline">home</hi>&#44; it would have borne as near a relation to <hi rend="underline">humus</hi>&#44; &#40;the ground&#41;<lb/> as it does in the Hebrew to <hi rend="underline">Adamah</hi>.  We have no reason to conclude the names in the<lb/> Mosaic history <hi rend="underline">were the original names</hi>&#44; and not translated by Moses into the language which<lb/> he wrote&#59; since we have a plain instance of such a translation in his own name&#59; which as it<lb/> was given him by Pharaoh&#39;s daughter&#44; an Egyptian&#44; cannot be supposed to have been originally<lb/> Hebrew&#59; therefore&#44; not <hi rend="underline">Mosheh</hi>&#44; as he wrote it&#44; but as it is in the Coptic version <hi rend="underline">Mo&#252;si</hi>&#44;<lb/> from <hi rend="underline">Mo&#252;</hi>&#44; which in that language signifies water&#44; and si&#44; taken.  But Moses finding the<lb/> Hebrew word <hi rend="underline">Mosheh</hi>&#44; to &#34;draw out&#34;&#44; bearing some resemblance in sound to his name&#44; and in<lb/> signification to the occasion of it&#44; translated the Egyptian name <hi rend="underline">Mo&#252;si</hi>&#44; into the Hebrew <hi rend="underline">Mosheh</hi>.&#34;<lb/>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            2<lb/>
                Thus Jennings writes exhaustively on the subject&#44; and clearly shows that other oriental tongues<lb/> can lay a better claim than the Hebrew.  Again he says &#34;Abeb&#44; or Hebeb&#44; which in Hebrew signifies<lb/> vanity or a vapour&#44; seems not a name very opposite to Adam&#39;s second son&#44; and therefore Moses<lb/> hat assigned no reason for his being called that name.  But if it be derived from the syriac<lb/> <hi rend="underline">jehab eil</hi>&#44; which signifies&#44; <hi rend="underline">Deus dedit</hi>&#44; it is very proper and expressive.  So the name Babel&#44;<lb/> which the Hebrew text infroms us was so called because Lord did there <hi rend="underline">balal</hi>&#59; that is&#44; confirmed<lb/> the language of all the earth&#44; may be more naturally derived from the Syriac&#59; in which tongue<lb/> Babel&#44; or Bobeel&#44; signifies <hi rend="underline">confusion</hi>.  So that the Syriac&#44; or perhaps any other of the eastern<lb/> tongues&#44; might be proved by this argument&#44; from the etymology of the names&#44; to have been<lb/> the original language&#44; as well as the Hebrew.<lb/>
            Le Clere advances the idea&#44; that neither the Hebrew&#44; nor Syriac nor Chaldee&#44; nor<lb/> any other language now extant&#44; was the true original tongue&#59; but that this and the other<lb/> Oriental tongues have all sprung from&#44; or are so many different dialects of that first lan&#45;<lb/>guage&#44; itself now lost among them&#59; as the Italian&#44; French and Spanish&#44; are none of them<lb/> the language of the Ancient Romans&#44; but all derived from it.<lb/>
                Great diversity of opinion exists about the confusion of tongues at the tower of Babel.<lb/>  Julius Scaliger a modern Jewish writer&#44; understands not a multiplication of tongues&#44; but a<lb/> confusion of those ideas&#44; which they affixed to words&#58; e. g. one called for a stone&#44; and he mis pre&#45;<lb/>sented with mortar by one and with sand by another.  Other Jews make the number of lan&#45;<lb/>guages then&#44; <hi rend="underline">seventy</hi>&#44; imagining there were seventy different nations then planted in the world&#59;<lb/> a notion which they ground on the following passage.  &#34;When the Most High divided to the na&#45;<lb/>tions their inheritance&#44; when he separated the sons of Adam&#44; he set the bounds of the people<lb/> according to the number of the Children of Israel&#34; Deut. 32.8<lb/>
                The mention you make of Jacob calling the heap of stones <hi rend="underline">Gal ed</hi>&#8212;a Hebrew word&#44;<lb/> while Laban called it <hi rend="underline">gigar sahadhatha</hi> a pure Chaldee word&#44; leads some writers to sup&#45;<lb/>pose that Hebrew was the language of the Canaanites&#44; which Abraham and his posterity<lb/> <sic>learnt</sic> by dwelling among them.  This is Le Cleu&#39;s idea&#8212;<hi rend="underline">but not mine</hi>.<lb/>
                I am sorry you have such an indifferent opinion of my favorite author Philo&#44; or rather<lb/> of his attainments.  True he was an Hellenist and <sic>worshiped</sic> his God in Greek&#44; while he was<lb/> a Hebrew&#44; and still from his writings I cannot but believe he was well versed in Hebrew literature.<lb/>  I find him in very respectable company&#44; for Jennings commenting on the marginal corrections<lb/>

                in the original manuscripts&#44; and copies says &#34;Further&#44; it should seem that these margin&#45;<lb/>al corrections were not in the copies&#44; from whence either the Seventy&#44; the Chaldee Paraphrast&#44;<lb/> Aquilla&#44; Symmachus or Theodosian made their versions&#59; since they sometimes follow the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Kevi</hi>&#44; sometimes the <hi rend="underline">chethibh</hi>&#59; whereas had these marginal corrections been in their cop&#45;<lb/>ies&#44; they would doubtless&#44; ordinarily&#44; if not always&#44; have followed them.  Neither Josephus&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">nor Philo</hi>&#44; nor Origen&#44; nor Jerome&#44; make any mention of the Kevi and the chethibh&#59; nor<lb/> does the Mishnah.&#34;  This must from Philo Hebrew scholar&#44; and give weight to his remarks<lb/> concerning the origin of the word Israel.  Moreover&#44; in Philo&#44; I find a greater number by far&#44;<lb/> of meanings to Biblical names&#44; than in any book outside a dictionary.  True&#44; his reading<lb/> may have been the Septuagint&#44; but that does not give these definitions&#44; so I am constrained to<lb/> believe him a Hebrew Scholar.<lb/>
                Bellarmine&#44; in his Hebrew Grammar&#44; maintains that the Hebrew&#44; abounds in the a&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> etymologies and roots of the names both of men and things&#44; and that in its names of brutes&#44; it<lb/> expresses their nature and properties more significantly and properly and more accurately&#44; than<lb/> in any other known language in the world.  I want you to note this&#44; for I want as a set off<lb/> to quote from Dr. Clarke something very different.  I meant to note&#44; the many various and diverse views ex&#45;<lb/>pressed by different scholars on this subject&#44; so that what we cannot nail as facts&#44; we can<lb/> call presumptions&#44; and then perhaps <hi rend="underline">my presumptions</hi>&#44; may be as good as any ones.<lb/>
            Your celebrated writer Deutsche&#44; denies that the Hebrew is the original tongue&#59; he<lb/> says &#34;With regard to its lexical and grammatical position&#44; it occupies that mean<lb/> between the Aramaic as the poorest and the Arabic as the richest.&#34;<lb/>
            I should have mentioned above in speaking of Philo&#44; Dr Clarkes opinion of him&#59;<lb/> he says&#44; in mentioning his various authorities for his great work&#45;&#45;&#34;Among the Jews<lb/> several eminent commentators appeared at different times&#44; x x x Philo Judaeus&#44;<lb/> may be reckoned among these.  His works contain several curious treatises in ex&#45;<lb/>plication of the different parts of the Hebrew Scriptures.&#34;<lb/>
                Genesis 10 chap 20. v. reads &#34;These are the sons of Ham&#44; after their families&#44; after<lb/> <hi rend="underline">their tongues</hi>&#44; in their countries&#44; and in their nations.&#34;  Same Chapter v. 31. reads<lb/> &#34;These are the sons of Shem&#44; after their families&#44; after <hi rend="underline">their tongues</hi>&#44; in their lands&#44;<lb/> after their nations.&#34;  By this it would seem&#44; that a hundred years after the flood&#44; they<lb/> had different <hi rend="underline">tongues</hi>&#44; to various families&#59;<lb/>

                You say &#34;The fact that the Alphabet&#8212;doubtless of very ancient origin&#44; and according<lb/> to the sages coeval with creation contains the names of letters like Beth &#40;He&#41; Nam &#40;ar&#41; &#38;c<lb/> carries out the views generally entertained&#41; Gradually&#44; however&#44; the two languages diverged&#44;<lb/> so that at the time of Jacob they were entirely distinct.&#34;  What <hi rend="underline">proof</hi> have you of this&#63;<lb/>  Might not the <sic>Amaraic</sic>&#44; have been impregnated with Hebrew&#44; after the Exodi&#63;  I think<lb/> so.  This Aramaic&#44; from Aram&#44; pertains to the language or literature of Syria and<lb/> Mesopotamia and likewise to Chaldea.  &#34;The Chaldee or Chaldaic was the language of the<lb/> ancient Babylonian and Assyrian Empires&#44; and is supposed to have been derived from the<lb/> Hebrew which it closely resembles.&#34; x x x &#34;The Hebrew language is supposed by many<lb/> to have been the original language&#44; spoken before the confusion of Babel&#44; though of<lb/> this <hi rend="underline">we have no positive proof</hi>&#34; Parks Pantology&#44; article Glossology.<lb/>
            Now if the Aramaic was Chaldee&#44; and was the mother tongue&#44; of the Hebrew&#44; how is it&#44; as I<lb/> said before&#44; that the children of the Kingdom of Judah&#44; when captive in Babylon&#44; for<lb/> seventy years&#44; lost their mother tongue&#63;  You say&#44; by their mothers teaching the ver&#45;<lb/>nacular&#8212;but if this vernacular&#44; was derived from the mother tongue&#44; how lose it&#63;<lb/>
                Park&#44; in his Pantology says &#34;The Oriental langauges are <hi rend="underline">doubtless</hi> the most an&#45;<lb/>cient of all.  The Hebrew is <hi rend="underline">probably</hi> the oldest. X x x The Coptic was the original<lb/> language of Egypt and it is one of the most ancient known.  It was expressed by the<lb/> characters commonly called <hi rend="underline">Hieroglyphics</hi>&#44; from a Greek word signifying a <hi rend="underline">sacred en&#45;<lb/>graving</hi>.  The Earliest Hieroglyphics appear to have been imitations&#44; or natural sym&#45;<lb/>bols of the object which they expressed.  Thus an <hi rend="underline">eye</hi>&#44; with a sceptre beneath it&#44; signi&#45;<lb/>fied a <hi rend="underline">King</hi>.  A flying <hi rend="underline">hawk</hi>&#44; represented the <hi rend="underline">ming</hi> &#38;c &#38;c.  From these hieroglyphics<lb/> were derived the <hi rend="underline">phonetic characters</hi>&#59; and which constituted <hi rend="underline">probably</hi>&#44; the earliest al&#45;<lb/>phabet known.&#34;  You perceive these deep read authors&#44; deal in <hi rend="underline">probably&#39;s</hi> and <hi rend="underline">doubtless</hi>&#44;<lb/> but give nothing as <hi rend="underline">facts</hi>&#58; no steel&#45;cold facts.  Park&#44; also says&#44; &#34;The Arabic&#44; has many<lb/> words in common with the Hebrew&#44; as the Arabians&#44; through Ishmael are also de&#45;<lb/>scendants of Abraham&#59; but it is written in a more difficult character &#38;c &#38;c&#34; Clarke says<lb/> the Hebrew sprung from the Arabic or the Arabic from the Hebrew&#33;  Sir William Jones&#44; says<lb/> <hi rend="underline">positively</hi>&#44; the <del>Ara</del> Hebrew sprung from the Arabic&#33;  Now&#44; may not the Arabic&#44; have<lb/> sprung from the Hebrew in after ages&#44; not on account of Ishmael at all&#44; but after the<lb/> Exodi&#63;  The historian Gibbon suspected the <sic>Sanscrit</sic> to be largely borrowed from<lb/>

                Mrs Mary Freeman Shepherd&#44; an English lady of genius and knowledge of various<lb/> languages&#44; among them the Hebrew&#44; in a letter&#44; written fifty years ago to a prominent<lb/> Minister&#44; to substantiate her views of Moses being the Author of the book of Job&#44; says&#44;<lb/> &#34;To Israel&#44; Moses conveyed the <hi rend="underline">pure language of their fathers</hi>&#59; but rather than<lb/> the nations should be famished for bread&#44; or die for thirst he put <hi rend="underline">manna</hi> in their<lb/> coarse earthen vessels and wine in their wooden cups.&#34;  Now to me&#44; the idea is very<lb/> absurd&#44; that the descendants of <hi rend="underline">seventy persons</hi>&#44; enslaved in the heart of a country&#44; for<lb/> four centuries at least&#44; retained their mother tongue during that time&#59; so that at<lb/> the end of that period&#44; one born three hundred and twenty years after their entrance<lb/> therein &#40;for Moses was Eighty when they came out&#41; could write in that language&#44; and<lb/> when he had been forty years from them&#44; speaking all that time another tongue&#59;<lb/> The time was long enough for Moses to have lost it entirely.  It does not even now&#44; in the<lb/> age of Books&#44; take long for a language to almost lose its originality&#8212;how much<lb/> easier was it so to do&#44; when there were none&#63;  At the late ecumenical council in<lb/> Rome&#44; the bishops spoke <hi rend="underline">Latin</hi>&#44; but the eastern bishops&#44; could not understand<lb/> the western&#44; and the Roman bishops understood <hi rend="underline">neither</hi>&#33;<lb/>
                But speaking of Languages&#8212;they are all a compound&#44; and formed from adven&#45;<lb/>titious circumstances&#44; e. g. The Spanish language is derived from the Phoenician<lb/> of the early colonists&#44; and of the Carthaginian conquerors&#44; mingled with the Latin<lb/> of the Romans&#8212;from which and the language of the Visigoths&#44; a <hi rend="underline">Romance</hi> lan&#45;<lb/>guage was formed about A. D. 623.  this <hi rend="underline">Romance tongue</hi> with some <hi rend="underline">Arabic</hi><lb/> words from the Moors forms the basis of the <hi rend="underline"><sic>Castilian</sic> tongue</hi>&#44; which according to<lb/> Sismondi&#44; dates back to A. D. 1050&#44; and not until 1252 under Alphonso tenth&#44;<lb/> was the <hi rend="underline">Spanish Language</hi>&#8212;so called&#8212;acknowledged by a code of laws written in it.<lb/>  Now&#44; here we have&#44; Phoenician&#44; Carthaginian&#44; Latin&#44; Arabic and Visgoth&#44; from&#45;<lb/>ing the present Spanish language.  In my <hi rend="underline">own individual</hi> summing up on the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">origin of the Hebrew</hi>&#8212;I will incidentally refer to this again.<lb/>
            We will take one instance of the great uncertainty of writing among the ancients&#44;<lb/> and a much later date than the Aramaic you speak of&#8212;Homer&#45;&#45;&#34;The most ancient<lb/> of all the profane writers.&#34;  According to Paterculus he flourished 968. B. C.  According to<lb/>
            
            <pb n="6"/>
            6<lb/>
                Herodus 8 84.  The &#91;&#63;&#93;delian &#91;&#63;&#93; place it 907 B. C.  So little known of him&#44;<lb/> that seven cities contend for the place of his birth&#44; and he is called the author of the<lb/> Iliad and Odyssey.  Smyrna&#44; Chias&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; Colosshon&#44; Salamis&#44; Rhodes&#44; Aryos and Athens&#44;<lb/> all lay claim to his birth place&#44; and the matter is still in dispute&#59; and he is still for<lb/> aught we know a <hi rend="underline">fabulous person</hi>&#59; and it is getting to be believed&#44; that the Trojan war<lb/> and Homer&#44; with his Achilles and Ajax&#44; Menelous and Ulysses&#44; Diomedes and<lb/> Patriclus&#91;&#63;&#93; and his Agamemnor and Nestor <hi rend="underline">were myths</hi>.  Some late writers&#44; have as&#45;<lb/>cribed these &#91;&#63;&#93; to Solomon&#44; composed after his disaffection from the true religion<lb/> to idolatry.  The word Homer&#8212;<hi rend="underline">Homerus</hi> is merely the Hebrew <hi rend="underline">Omerim</hi> with a<lb/> Greek termination&#44; signifying&#44; the <hi rend="underline">sayings</hi> or <hi rend="underline">discourses</hi>&#8212;from <hi rend="underline">Omar</hi>&#8212;he spoke&#44;<lb/> and that is what they are&#8212;dialogues or conversations of the principal characters.  Even<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">battles</hi> of Homer are full of parleys&#44; and the information we get of the poem&#44;<lb/> is through the conversation of the respective chiefs.<lb/>
                Even nine hundred or a thousand years later&#44; when an event of ten thousand<lb/> times the importance of the siege of Troy&#44; took place in Bethlehem&#59; neither the day&#44;<lb/> month nor year was noted&#44; and is not known to the present day.  For the sake of<lb/> argument take this mean time of 907 B. C. according to the Arundelian Marbles&#44; and it<lb/> takes us back in Biblical times to Elijah&#44; in the first of the Rings and about 580 years<lb/> from the giving the law on Sinai&#59; while we see that even the Jews had made no gen&#45;<lb/>eral use of their knowledge of writing <sic>untill</sic> after the captivity a period of about 960 years.<lb/>  The antiquity of the Pentateuch sets it at the head of all the writings in the world&#44; while its<lb/> philosophy&#44; jurisprudence&#44; history&#44; geography and chronology&#44; entitle it to the respect<lb/> of the whole human race.<lb/>
                Dr. Clarke in his notes to chap 34 of Deuteronomy&#44; says&#44; &#34;It is allowed among<lb/> learned men that where a word occurs not as a verb in the Hebrew Bible&#44; its root may<lb/> be legitimately sought&#44; in the Arabic.  He who controverts this position knows little of the<lb/> ground on which he stands.&#34;  And again in the commencement of his work he says &#34;It is<lb/> a maxim that admits of no controversy that every <hi rend="underline">noun</hi> in the Hebrew language is derived<lb/> from a <hi rend="underline">verb</hi> which is usually termed the <hi rend="underline">radix</hi> or <hi rend="underline">root</hi>&#59; from which not only the noun but<lb/> all the different <sic>flections</sic> of the verb spring. x x x The root in Hebrew and in its sister lan&#45;<lb/>guage the <hi rend="underline">Arabic</hi>&#44; generally consists of three letters and every word must be traced to its root &#38;c &#38;c<lb/>

            7<lb/>
            In Hebrew and Arabic&#44; this is essentially necessary&#44; and no man can safely criticise on<lb/> any word in either of these languages who does not carefully attend to this point.<lb/>
                I mention the Arabic with the Hebrew for two reasons 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> because the two languages<lb/> evidently spring from the same source&#44; and have very nearly the same mode of construction.<lb/>  2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> because the different roots in the Hebrew Bible are to be sought for in the Arabic lan&#45;<lb/>guage.  The reason of this must be obvious&#44; when it is considered that the whole of the He&#45;<lb/>brew language is lost except what is in the Bible&#44; and even a part of this Book is written in<lb/> Chaldee. x x x If a particular form of Hebrew word occur that cannot be traced to a root in<lb/> the Hebrew Bible&#44; because the word does not occur in the third person singular of the past<lb/> tense in the Bible&#44; it is expedient&#44; it is perfectly lawful and often it is <sic>indispensibly</sic> ne&#45;<lb/>cessary to seek the deficient root in the Arabic.  For as the Arabic is still a living language<lb/> and perhaps the most copious in the universe&#44; it may well be expected to furnish those terms<lb/> which are deficient in the Hebrew Bible.  And the reasonableness of this is founded in<lb/> another maxim&#44; viz&#44; <hi rend="underline">that either the Arabic was derived from the Hebrew&#44; or the Hebrew<lb/> from the Arabic</hi>.  I shall not enter into the controversy&#59; there are great names on both<lb/> sides&#44; and the decision of the question in either way&#44; will have the same effect on my<lb/> argument.  For if the Arabic were derived from the Hebrew&#44; it must have been when the<lb/> Hebrew was a living and complete language&#44; because such is the Arabic now&#59; and therefore<lb/> all its essential roots we may reasonably expect to find there.  But if as <hi rend="underline">Sir William<lb/> Jones supposed the Hebrew were derived from the Arabic</hi>&#44; the same expectation is gratified<lb/> the deficient roots in Hebrew may be sought in the <hi rend="underline">mother tongue</hi>.  x x x I make these<lb/> observations at the very threshold of my work&#44; because the necessity of acting on this prin&#45;<lb/>ciple &#40;seeking deficient Hebrew roots in the Arabic&#41; may often occur&#44; and I wish to<lb/> speak <hi rend="underline">once for all</hi> on the subject.&#34; 1 vol. p. 26.<lb/>
                Dr Adam Clarke&#44; was one of the most brilliant oriental scholars&#44; in the galaxy that<lb/> shone with such splendor on the English horizon in the first half of this century.

                in being able to enrich my manuscript with his rich thoughts and glowing expressions.<lb/>  So <sic>to</sic> with Philo&#44; he being so happy in his expressions and elegant in his variety&#44; was termed<lb/> in his day the &#34;Jewish Plato.&#34;  Scholars said that Philo Platonises or Plato Philonises.<lb/>  His work written in the reign of Caius&#44; met with such unbounded applause in the Roman<lb/> senate&#44; when he read it publicly that he was permitted to place it in the public library.<lb/>  His work was divided into three parts&#44; the first relating to the Creation of the world&#44;<lb/> the second spoke of sacred history&#44; and in the third the author makes mention of<lb/> the laws and customs of the Jewish nation.  This work I have in four volumes of<lb/> six hundred pages each&#44; and from its great erudition&#44; and the eminence of the author&#44;<lb/> a <sic>proufound</sic> Jewish philosopher&#44; and living before the final destruction of Jerusalem&#44;<lb/> some 1&#44;900 years ago&#44; and before the dispersion of the Jews&#44; leads me to infer he must<lb/> have been a fine Hebrew scholar.<lb/>
                Perhaps I might have been aided in this work&#44; were I able and could I have<lb/> consulted such great works as the Targums of Onkelas and Jonathan&#59; or the<lb/> Massorah&#59; or the <sic>Commentarys</sic> of such great Jewish lights as Rabbis Kimshi&#44;<lb/> Jarchi&#44; Levi Ben Gershom&#44; Maimonides&#44; Abarbanal and others too numerous<lb/> to mention&#44; whose brilliant intellects have been from age to age&#44; digging into that<lb/> mine of wealth to humanity&#44; the Jewish scriptures.

                Dr Winder&#44; in his &#34;History of Knowledge&#34; &#34;thinks it probable that this<lb/> was the first writing in Alphabetical characters ever exhibited to the world&#44; though<lb/> there might have been marks in hieroglyphics&#44; cut in wood&#44; stone &#38;c before this time.&#34;<lb/>  &#40;In his remarks on the delivery of the Law&#41; &#34;That these tables were written not by the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">commandment</hi>&#44; but by the <hi rend="underline">power of God himself</hi>&#44; the following passages seem to prove.<lb/>  &#39;And the Lord said with Moses&#44; come up to me in the mountain and be thou these&#44; and<lb/> I will give thee tables of stone <hi rend="underline">which I have written</hi>&#44; that thou mayest teach them.&#39;<lb/> Ex. 24. 12 &#39;And he gave unto Moses upon Mount Sinai&#44; two tables of testimony&#44; tables<lb/> of stone&#44; <hi rend="underline">written with the finger of God</hi>&#63; Exod. 31. 18. &#39;And Moses went down from the<lb/> mount&#59; and the two tables of testimony were in his hand&#59; the tables were written on both<lb/> their sides.  And the tables were <hi rend="underline">the work of God</hi>&#44; and the writing&#44; was the writing of<lb/> God&#44; graven upon the tables&#39; Exod 32.15.16 &#34;These words&#34; &#40;the ten commandments&#41;<lb/> &#39;the Lord spake in the mount&#44; out of the midst of the fire&#44; of the cloud and of the<lb/>

                I will make but one more quotation.  Dr Bayley&#44; in his remarks on this subject&#44; says<lb/> &#34;In time&#44; seems so proper from whence to date the introduction of <hi rend="underline">letters</hi> among the<lb/> Hebrews as this&#59; for after this period we find continual mention of <hi rend="underline">letters</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">reading</hi> and<lb/> <hi rend="underline">writing</hi> in the now proper sense of those words&#58; e. g. Deut 31.9.27&#61;8 &#38;c &#38;c Moses it is<lb/> said was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians&#44; in all the learning they <sic>posessed</sic>;<lb/> but it is manifest that he had not learned of them any method of writing&#44; otherwise<lb/> there had been no want of God&#39;s acts and assistance in writing the two tables of the law&#44;<lb/> no need of a miraculous writing.  Had Moses known this art&#44; the Lord might have said<lb/> to him&#44; as he did often afterwards&#44; &#39;write thou these words&#39; Exod 34.27 &#39;Write on the stones<lb/> the words of this law&#39; Deut. 27.3.  &#39;Write you this song for you&#39; 31.91.  Perhaps it may<lb/> be said&#44; God&#39;s writing the law gave it a <hi rend="underline">sanction</hi>.  True&#44; but why might it not also<lb/> teach the first use of letters&#44; <hi rend="underline">unless it can be proved that they were in use prior to this<lb/> transaction</hi>&#63;  It might be thought too much to assert that <hi rend="underline">letters</hi> no more than <hi rend="underline">language</hi><lb/> were a <hi rend="underline">national discovery</hi>&#58; that it was impossible for man to have <hi rend="underline">invented writing</hi>&#44;<lb/> and that he did not invent it&#58; yet this may appear really the case from the following re&#45;<lb/>flections&#58; 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. <hi rend="underline">Reason</hi> may show us how near to an impossibility it was&#44; that a just<lb/> and proper number of convenient characters for the <hi rend="underline">sounds</hi> in language&#59; should naturally be<lb/> hit upon by any man for whom it was easy to <hi rend="underline">imitate and vary</hi>&#44; but not to <hi rend="underline">invent</hi>.<lb/>  2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>. From <hi rend="underline">evidence</hi> of the Mosaic history&#44; it appears that the introduction of writing<lb/> among the Hebrews was not from <hi rend="underline">Man</hi>&#44; but <hi rend="underline">God</hi>.  3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>.  There are no evident<lb/> vestiges of letters subsisting among other nations&#44; <hi rend="underline">till after the delivery of the law at<lb/> Mount Sinai</hi>&#59; nor then&#44; among some&#44; till very late.&#34;<lb/>
                I said above&#44; I would make but one more quotation&#58; I must here however&#44; make<lb/> a note of a recollection just come into my mind&#44; bearing upon Dr Bayley&#39;s last remark.<lb/>  Kitto&#44; the celebrated English writer&#44; in his work on &#34;The Book of Job&#44; and the other<lb/> Poetical Books&#44;&#34; which I recently read&#44; wants to make out that Moses is its author<lb/> and that it was written when he was in Midian&#58; and to support that idea&#44; says many<lb/> writers here asserted there was no <hi rend="underline">writing</hi>&#44; before giving the law&#44; but&#44; they are in error&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">for the contrary has been proved</hi>&#8212;He does not give he proof.<lb/>

                Desiring to show the worth of my authorities&#44; from whom I have quoted&#44; I must say a word in<lb/> Roswell Park&#44; A. M. professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry in the University of Pennsyl&#45;<lb/>vania&#44; and member of Am. Phil. Society.  His great work&#44; &#34;Pantology or a systematic survey<lb/> of Human Knowledge&#34; is one of profound thought&#44; deep study and analytical natural clas&#45;<lb/>sification of Human Knowledge&#44; in its various branches of&#44; Glossology&#44; Psychology&#44; Nomology&#44;<lb/> Theology&#44; Geography&#44; Chronography&#44; Biography&#44; Callography&#44; Acrophysics&#44; Idiophys&#45;<lb/>ics&#44; Anduphysics&#44; Architechnics&#44; Chreotechnics &#38;c &#38;c and is the patient result of years<lb/> of <sic>unremitted</sic> labor&#44; in the vast field&#44; he has undertaken to illustrate.  He has produced<lb/> a work <sic>unrivalled</sic> in its line&#44; and an enduring monument of patient industry and scien&#45;<lb/>tific research.  The work was published thirty five years ago&#44; and is now out of print.<lb/>
                Well&#44; my evidence is all in&#44; and nothing now remains but to give <hi rend="underline">my own per&#45;<lb/> sonal views</hi> on the subject under controversy&#44; viz&#44; <hi rend="underline">The <sic>Origen</sic> of the Hebrew Language</hi>.<lb/>  Of all my authorities&#44; Dr Winder and Dr Bayley come nearest to my views&#44; but neither<lb/> speak of its <sic><hi rend="underline">Origen</hi></sic>.  They tell <hi rend="underline">when</hi> they think ti was reduced to a written language&#44;<lb/> and give their reasons&#44; for their views&#44; and which I think are very cogent&#44; but they do<lb/> not fully meet my ideas on the subject.  This is a matter&#44; I have brought years<lb/> of thought to&#44; and finding that all these authors only deal in <hi rend="underline">surmises</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">probabil&#45;<lb/>ities</hi> and <hi rend="underline">suppositions</hi>&#44; and glittering generalities&#44; I now for the first time produce mine.  It has been a lead&#45;<lb/>ing idea of mine&#44; to embody these views in a book&#44; and for that purpose I have la&#45;<lb/>bored for a long time collecting data&#44; pertinent thereto&#59; but I have now pretty much<lb/> given up that idea&#44; and most probably shall write no more on the subject&#44; than is em&#45;<lb/>braced in these few pages.  Not desiring to weary you&#44; I have condensed as much as<lb/> possible what I had to say&#44; and have let out many of my jottings&#44; that I had in&#45;<lb/>tended to write&#44; fearing my letter would be too voluminous&#59; but with all my care&#44; I<lb/> could not make it more brief.  And now to the point.<lb/>
                I claim&#44; that the Hebrew originated at the giving the Law on Mount Sinai&#33;<lb/>  That Abraham and all his descendants spoke Chaldee only&#44; for I have no <hi rend="underline">evidence</hi> of<lb/> any Hebrew Language before this time.  And my reasons are the following.<lb/>
            Going back to 1656 A. M. the Almighty glancing over the world&#44; saw it filled<lb/> with corruption and ungodliness&#44; and determined to sweep everything off of its surface.<lb/>  One man&#44; of the many&#44; many millions was found acceptable to God&#44; and he was saved<lb/>
            
            <pb n="11"/>
            11<lb/>
            from the general destruction and with him his family of seven persons&#44; they being saved<lb/> through his Godliness&#44; as ten such&#44; at an after period would have saved Sodom.<lb/>
            From Noah and his family the earth was repeopled&#44; but the start&#91;&#63;&#93; being bad&#44; they fell<lb/> into the same wicked courses&#44; as those before the flood&#59; but as Jehovah had made a covenant not<lb/> to drown out the world again&#44; He determined to manifest himself to mankind&#44; for their better<lb/> living and future salvation&#58; and to that end some five hundred years after the flood&#44; called Abram&#44;<lb/> a very good and God&#45;fearing man to go into Canaan and remain there&#44; taking as it were a<lb/> pre&#45;emptive right thereto&#44; for it was peopled&#44; but with inhabitants of the worst sort&#44; and whose<lb/> offenses were so rank&#44; even for that grossly sinful time&#44; that their cup was running over.<lb/>  This land God promised to his descendants&#44; whom he promised him should be exceedingly numerous.<lb/>  The Almighty blessed this man beyond precedent&#44; in the wealth of this world.  In due time<lb/> he had a son&#44; him also as he grew to manhood&#44; was thus blessed in even a more especial<lb/> manner than his father&#44; and in due course this son had a son&#44; upon whom was showered in a<lb/> worldly point of view every blessing.<lb/>
                To Abraham&#44; the Almighty had said he would send his descendants into a strange coun&#45;<lb/>try for four hundred years.  Naturally enough&#44; but still Providentially&#44; under the pressure<lb/> of famine Jacob with his family&#44; flocks and relatives&#44; probably numbering some 5&#44;000<lb/> souls&#44; went into Egypt&#44; where after a while&#44; the government&#44; seeing them poor in possess&#45;<lb/>lation and wealth&#44; perhaps feared an <hi rend="underline">imperium et imperio</hi>&#44; by some means not now known<lb/> reduced them to slavery.  Philo&#44; gives a most graphic account of this servitude&#44; which must<lb/> have been horrible&#44; but from which in Gods time they were released.<lb/>
                Their period of probation having been fulfilled&#44; the Almighty having appointed<lb/> a leader&#44; with a series of miracles unparalleled in their stupendousness in the annals<lb/> of the world&#44; brought them forth a consolidated nation of some 5&#44;000&#44;000 souls&#59; and in<lb/> re<del>a</del>vealing himself on Mount Sinai and giving them a code of laws and a system of<lb/> religion&#44; wrote with his own fingers their laws in <hi rend="underline">Hebrew Characters</hi>&#44; now for the<lb/> first time promulgated to them&#44; and Moses and the people&#44; <hi rend="underline">intuitively</hi> and by a<lb/> <hi rend="underline">miracle</hi> were enabled to understand them&#44; as was done centuries later in Jerusalem<lb/> on the day of Pentecost&#33;<lb/>
                Why should the Jew want to go back in the dead part to find the <sic>origen</sic><lb/> of his language&#63;  Is it singular or strange that Jehovah&#44; who from the very first<lb/>

                inception of their nationality&#44; had as it were&#44; held them in the hollow of his hand&#44; and<lb/> had protected&#44; guided and cared for them for centuries&#44; should now to guard them still<lb/> more from the idolatry of the surrounding nations&#44; as they were to take their place in the<lb/> family of nations&#44; provide them with a strange tongue&#63;  Had he not entered into a<lb/> <hi rend="underline">covenant</hi> with each and every Jew&#44; and who bore that symbol in their most secret part&#44;<lb/> hid from the eye of the world&#63;  Was not the whole system of revelation&#44; and this<lb/> personal covenant&#44; given to the Jew&#44; to <hi rend="underline">separate</hi> them from all the peoples of the earth&#44;<lb/> and to make of them a <hi rend="underline">holy nation</hi> and a <hi rend="underline">peculiar people</hi>&#63;  Had He not given<lb/> them a country&#44; such a one as no where else existed&#44; a land &#34;flowing with milk<lb/> and honey&#63;&#34;  Had he not with a &#34;mighty hand and an outstretched arm&#34; bro&#39;t<lb/> them out unscathed from the heart of a populous country&#44; and devoted their &#91;&#63;&#93;&#45;<lb/>ers to destruction&#63;  Had he not told Abraham&#44; his descendants should be his <hi rend="underline">cho&#45;<lb/>sen people</hi>&#44; that He would bless those that blessed them&#44; and curse those that<lb/> cursed them&#44; and up to this time had he not done it&#63;  And finally&#44; did He not care<lb/> for them for a period of forty years in the wilderness&#44; preparatory to their entrance<lb/> as a nation in the world&#63;  Then why wonder that he gave them a distinct&#44;<lb/> a peculiar and written language&#63;<lb/>
                This is my theory.  I here at Mount Sinai&#44; given amid thunders and<lb/> lightening&#44; proclaim this miracle of the Hebrew language&#44; at the moment the He&#45;<lb/>brews became a nation&#44; as a God&#45;given and peculiar language to his chose peo&#45;<lb/>ple&#44; and nothing that I have seen in the writings of the profoundest scholars&#44;<lb/> has caused me to alter my opinions.  Their writings on the subject&#44; are not based on<lb/> <hi rend="underline">one tangible fact</hi>&#44; but are theories and suppositions only&#44; conflicting with each other<lb/> and unable to bear the scrutiny of the plainest common sense.  Those languages&#44;<lb/> the Aramaic&#44; the Phoenician&#44; the Arabic&#44; Chaldee&#44; Canaanitish and others<lb/> that resemble it&#44; have become impregnated <hi rend="underline">from the Hebrew</hi>&#44; from the intercourse<lb/> the nations had with the Jews&#44; for our knowledge of these languages is desired long<lb/> after the exode&#44; and when the Hebrews had made themselves a power in the land.<lb/>
            I remain with respects<lb/>
            Yours truly<lb/>
