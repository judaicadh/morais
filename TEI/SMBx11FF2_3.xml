            <p>2nd Anniv. Sermon.<lb/></p>
            <p>My Brethren&#33;  Time which unconsciously steals upon us&#44; has brought<lb/> us to the second anniversary of the dedication of this Synagogue.<lb/>  And here I pause&#59; for&#44; I know not whether I should give utterance to<lb/> my thoughts.  In the days of the prophet Isaiah&#44; men had grown<lb/> so wicked that they dared thus to address the messengers of God &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Speake unto us smooth things&#44; prophesy deceit&#34;.<lb/>  But however sinful we may be&#44; we have not yet so entirely cast<lb/> off the sense of shame.  We suffer the spiritual teacher to portray<lb/> our derelictions in the blackest hues&#44; and venture not to restrain him.<lb/>  But do we heed his words&#63;  Nay&#44; do the men in affluence bestow there&#45;<lb/>&#45;on even a moment of serious reflection&#63;  If they did we should rejoice<lb/> this day over its salutary effect.  This gorgeous dwelling we<lb/> have professedly reared in honor to God&#44; would&#44; in all truth&#44; be<lb/> the house of God.  I am full aware&#44; that there exists a<lb/> general disposition to palliate our supineness on this score.  It is<lb/> of course ascribed to the distracted condition of the land.  But the pretext<lb/> lacks even the semblance of reason.  No&#44; our recklessness was glaringly<lb/> exhibited before these troublous times had lighted upon us.  They<lb/> who set watching and sound the alarm&#44; deprecated it.  They descried<lb/> the evil it would occasion&#44; and betimes warmed the delinquents.<lb/>  But their words were deemed inopportune&#44; their suggestion an intrusion.<lb/>  But ar irrespective of this lamentable fact&#44; is our allegation at all tenable&#63;<lb/>  Has indeed the train of national sorrows&#44; which is passing over our heads&#44;<lb/> crushed every one beneath its weight&#63;  Is there none&#44; who despite of<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>it&#44; or rather by reason of it&#44; have thriven and flourished&#63;  Oh&#33; let us<lb/> not seek to set a gloss on our moral deformities.  Let us confess that<lb/> we have unconcernedly looked upon the tottering condition of the hallowed<lb/> edifice&#44; we should have built upon immoveable basis.  Aye&#44; we seem<lb/> to pride ourselves in its architectural beauties&#44; while the pillars thereof<lb/> threaten to fall.  Lo&#33;  We have seen around us younger institutions attain<lb/> a stable position&#44; while through the zeal and well concerted actions of<lb/> its supporters&#44; while we have been gradually descending from the<lb/> altitude gained in former years.  The hope of our predecessors of<lb/> the house of Israel&#44; has been vanishing apace.  They desired to per&#45;<lb/>&#45;petuate by unostentatious means the fair fame of the Congregations<lb/> founded by the exiles of the Siberian countries&#44; we have forfeited it&#44; it<lb/> first by improvidence then by unpardonable niggardliness.<lb/></p>
            <p>Awake my Brethren&#33;  Let the dismal but not overdrawn picture&#44;<lb/> point out to us all our imperative duties.  In order to avert our the<lb/> final decay of this Institution we must exercise liberality.  Let those who have lent<lb/> their assistance&#44; demean more generously.  Let them offer on the shrine<lb/> of their ancestral religion that which will firmly reestablish the altar<lb/> of the Lord.  It is the necessary course suggested by my humble<lb/> self on various occasions.  And it is&#44; I believe&#44; the only measure which<lb/> whence will accrue a permanent benefit to the cause we ought to<lb/> have at heart.  Another Any other may delay the fall&#44; but well aggra&#45;<lb/>&#45;vate it&#44; and cause &#91;Hebrew&#93; a profanation of the name of God.<lb/>  Shall I again have appealed in vain&#63;  Shall another year<lb/></p>

            <p>elapse and find us in the same anomalous state&#63;  My friends&#33;  When<lb/> I read of the munificent endowments wherewith our fellow&#45;believers<lb/> beyond the Atlantic enrich their places of worship&#44; I ask myself<lb/> whether the vast separation cast between us&#44; has not proved a sea of<lb/> Sethean waters&#63; for&#44; why there so much activity&#44; here much apathy&#63;<lb/>  Ought not that which is by them deemed a meritorious act&#44; be viewed<lb/> alike by us to the same light&#63;  The Sages of our nation have recommended<lb/> that by the joint efforts of all the Israelites residing in the same city&#44;<lb/> the Synagogue should be loftily raised&#59; so that each individual may<lb/> say as Ezra the priest said &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;let the house of our God be<lb/> exalted.&#34;  Wherefore are our brethren in the eastern hemisphere continent are prompted<lb/> liberally to bestow their gifts for the furtherance of that holy object<lb/> upon all occasions.  Have they experienced a signal favor from the Lord&#63;<lb/>  The first token of gratitude is their pouring gold into the treasury of<lb/> his consecrated mansion.  Are they enduring tribulations&#63;  They accompany<lb/> their propitiatory supplications entreaties by a free&#45;will offering.  Are they<lb/> about to quit the scene of this nether world and its fleeting enjoyments&#63;<lb/>  They strive to eternize their names among the assembly of the faithful<lb/> by a noble bequest to the dwelling where they were wont to bow in holy<lb/> adoration.  Now&#44; my beloved hearers&#33;  Will our demeanour<lb/> compare favorably with theirs&#63;...I cannot divine what the future<lb/> may bring forth&#44; but experience demonstrates that in it this respect we<lb/> do not hold a community of sentiments with our distant coreligionists.<lb/>  Still I do not now call upon you to emulate them.

            <p>greatly delight to see him&#44; for instance&#44; whose sole heir the Most<lb/> High has rescued from baneful distempers&#44; bring his oblation to the minor<lb/> Sanctuary&#59; her who suffers domestic afflictions&#44; justify the decrees of<lb/> Providence by a present bet denoting heartfelt devotion&#59; them who<lb/> are verging on the last confines of existence&#44; turn a significant look<lb/> of affection to the glorious &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; whence their orisons ascended the<lb/> throne of mercy&#44; nevertheless I do not venture to urge the prosecution of<lb/> that course.  The minds of my auditors would not in all likelihood<lb/> be prepared to imbibe the instruction.  But what I pressingly and im&#45;<lb/>&#45;ploringly ask is that you will with the utmost exertion prevent the<lb/> downfall of a hallowed institution.  I counsel those who have pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;vided for the requirements of their offspring&#44; to reser reserve a small<lb/> portion of their wealth for the salvation of their souls. I exhort<lb/> all to present to the God of Israel a habitation wherein his name<lb/> may be exalted&#59; to secure its maintenance by a scrupulous satisfaction<lb/> of all its wants.  Is it too much to ask of the descendants of the<lb/> men&#44; concerning whom we found it recorded this day that at the<lb/> dedication of the Tabernacle each spontaneously offered two hundred shekels<lb/> of silver&#44; ten shekels of gold&#44; and an abundance of cattle for the burnt&#45;<lb/>sacrifices&#63;  Oh&#33; my friends&#33; let their righteous example stimulate<lb/> us to activity.  What cannot be singly achieved&#44; the conjoint labor<lb/> of many will perform &#91;Hebrew&#93; wrote our Rabbins.  &#34;A poor com&#45;<lb/>&#45;munity is not an impossibility&#34; for when all its members are actuated<lb/> by correct feelings&#44; their several contributions must need swell into.<lb/></p>
