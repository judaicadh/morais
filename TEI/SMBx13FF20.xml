            <p>&#43;Gian Battista Vico&#44; a deep thinker of the 17th<lb/> century&#44; in his &#34;Principles of a new science&#44; regarding<lb/> the common origin of all nations.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>The celebrated David Samuel Luzzatto&#44; considering the name<lb/> Semitic given to such languages&#44; not exact&#44; because the Ethio&#45;<lb/>pian&#44; spoken by the descendants of Ham&#44; is comprised in the same<lb/> group&#44; calls them &#34;triliteral&#34; that is&#44; having three letters<lb/> for their root.<lb/></p>

So true it is&#44;<lb/> that in order to find in the Sanskrit the simplicity<lb/> natural to a primitive language&#44; the learned have ima&#45;<lb/>&#45;gined and sought to have detected the existence of older<lb/> dialects&#44; now said to be almost extinct&#44; from which it<lb/> drew its derivation.  Not so with the Hebrew.<lb/>  Its construction manifestly proves it original.<lb/></p>

            <p>It produces its own testimonials&#44; not only in the limited<lb/> number of words it contains&#44; which number&#44; however&#44; has<lb/> been considerably underrated&#44; but in the inflexibility it in&#45;<lb/>&#45;variably maintains&#44; and by reason of which every term<lb/> keeps its distinct individuality&#44; assuming occasionally<lb/> a different sense&#44; according to the manner in which it<lb/> is used&#44; but never lending itself to being refashioned at<lb/> pleasure.  The few abstracts terms it possesses&#44;<lb/> mostly retain their ingenious and at once striking<lb/> meaning.  The few roots on which the tree of the<lb/> Hebrew language rises&#44; have the character&#44; common to<lb/> Semitic tongues&#59; they are formed of three letters&#44; which<lb/> the frequent changes in vowel&#45;points render at<lb/> times monosyllables.  And so does the Hebrew<lb/> visibly come the very nearest to the monosyllabic<lb/> languages&#44; which reason suggests to have been first<lb/> spoken by the human race in its infancy.<lb/></p>

            <p>The name of the Deity in Hebrew.<lb/></p>
            <p>Remarkable in the Hebrew is its decided and positive<lb/> character.  It gives it an air of austerity&#44; but renders<lb/> it preeminently fit to become the hand&#45;maid of religion&#44;<lb/> speaking authoritatively to the mind&#44; or rather to the<lb/> feelings.  I have said &#34;of religion&#34; but not of mysti&#45;<lb/>&#45;cism&#59; for&#44; Biblical diction has none of that vague<lb/> and indefinite phraseology of other tongues&#44; and espe&#45;<lb/>&#45;cially of the Oriental&#44; which dims&#44; if it does not alto&#45;<lb/>&#45;gether hide under a thick veil&#44; ideas connected with su&#45;<lb/>&#45;pernatural things.  The thoughts set forth are<lb/> always clear and forcible.  I do not know in what<lb/> language of either a people in his primitive simplicity&#44; or<lb/> of one highly cultivated has the ineffable name of the<lb/> Supreme Being been presented more plainly and yet withal more<lb/> expressively.  For by the sign of the Future tense with<lb/> which it begins&#44; the Eternity and Infinity of God are sug&#45;<lb/>&#45;gested to our intellects&#44; and while the Yod &#43; points to<lb/> His personal existence&#44; radically excluding pantheistic theories&#44;<lb/> the remaining letters &#177; denote His presence&#44; all&#45;pervading &#38; ubiquitous.<lb/></p>  
            <p>&#43; The sign of the 3d person.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#177; According to Debenedeth&#44; all the three letters &#91;Hebrew&#93; stand to signify the<lb/> Present tense.<lb/></p>

            <p>Close Identity between the Phoenician and Hebrew&#45;languages<lb/></p>
            <p>Deserving of special attention to the student of Hebrew are<lb/> the disinterred documents and relics of the Phoenician people&#45;&#45;the<lb/> British of antiquity.  First and successful navigators&#44;<lb/> inventors of the Alphabet&#44; creators of many branches of<lb/> industry&#44; an agricultural and at the same time a tra&#45;<lb/>&#45;ding nation&#44; learned but sensual and avaricious and<lb/> cruelly idolators&#44; burning human victims to fierce gods&#44;<lb/> the history of their achievements and of their follies will<lb/> improve the student of philology.

Carthage fell&#44; and as the epic<lb/> bard had written&#44; no vestige was left of even her ruins.<lb/>  But traces of her political and civil life are stamped<lb/> on medals&#44; which the earth&#44; wherein they were hidden&#44; was<lb/> made to return.  What the spirit of research<lb/> has met in various places on which Carthage sat her<lb/> foot&#44; discloses the analogy nay&#44; the identity existing<lb/> between the language she spoke and the language<lb/> of the Bible.<lb/></p>
            <p>Whence does the word Carthage itself draw its deriva&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion&#44; but from Kart&#225;&#44; in Scriptural Chaldaic &#34;City&#34;<lb/> and doubtless in this instance&#44; the city par excellence&#63;<lb/></p>

            <p>Professor Renan&#44; lecturing on the study of the Semitic<lb/> languages&#44; and descanting on the exalted merits of Bibli&#45;<lb/>&#45;cal literature&#44; said once to the students who had crowded<lb/> around that without the book of Psalms&#44; Lamminais<lb/> would not have become so powerful a writer.  But<lb/> this distinguished French author drew inspiration from<lb/> a mediatory agency&#44; from a version of the Hebrew<lb/> Psalter.  Had he beheld the sublime majesty investing<lb/> the original&#44; even his incisive style would have gained<lb/> in vigour.  For&#44; immutable are the beauties Holy<lb/> Writ possesses.  To feel their influence&#44; they must be seen<lb/> in their primitive splendour.  They will fade under<lb/> the pencil attempting to reproduce them.<lb/></p>

None&#44; most assuredly&#44; that whose production<lb/> may compare favorably in elegance of diction and poetical<lb/> excellencies with the various and <sic>marvellous</sic> rendering<lb/> of Greek and Latin authors.  The lack of a work<lb/> of such a nature is universally felt.<lb/></p>
            <p>Perhaps the youths of our time&#44; infused with enthusiasm<lb/> for the grandest of volumes&#44; may assume the arduous<lb/> but glorious undertaking &#43;.  To perform it well&#44;<lb/> the Spirit of poetry must rule the soul&#44; and a <sic>through</sic><lb/> knowledge of two languages sway the mind.
