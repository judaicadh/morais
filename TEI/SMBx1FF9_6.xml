                <p>I owe you many apologies for<lb/> not acknowledging earlier your favor of the<lb/> 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Nov. but I am sure you will acquit<lb/> me from blame&#44; were you to know how much<lb/> my time &#38; mind has been occupied particularly<lb/> with family matters&#44; from the unfortunate state<lb/> of my Brothers health.  Who now for nearly<lb/> 12 months has been a severe sufferer &#38; totally<lb/> incapable to attend to any business a source<lb/> of deep anxiety &#38; concern to his family<lb/></p>
                <p>Mrs. Almosnino &#38; myself are rejoiced to<lb/> learn the improved state of your health<lb/> and that you were more reconciled to the<lb/> place &#38; gaining friends we continually<lb/> inquire concerning you of our mutual<lb/> friend Mr Peixotto we have not yet<lb/> seen the discourses you allude to but<lb/> expect to have the Occident shortly &#38;<lb/> have no doubt we shall derive satisfaction<lb/> from their perusal.  I cannot report<lb/></p>

                <p>you were here now.  I do not anticipate<lb/> that the undertaking can be carried out<lb/> for at least a twelve months for it is<lb/> not intended to take effect until<lb/> sufficient funded capital is secured.<lb/>  we are the only congregation which as yet<lb/> has voted a sum from the congregational<lb/> fund.  Affairs in one congregation remain<lb/> in status quo.  You have no doubt been<lb/> made acquainted that our mutual friend<lb/> Mr Peixotto was elected at Rosh<lb/> Ashana.  I need not say that he is a great<lb/> acquisition &#38; that I am delighted at<lb/> having so able a coadjutor in <sic>Synagoges</sic><lb/> matters.  I must not omit to mention<lb/> to you that the Misses Belisario make<lb/> frequent inquiries after you &#38; that you<lb/> have their best wishes for your well being<lb/> and you will be pleased to hear that my<lb/> eldest niece is finishing her education<lb/> in their establishment&#44; and that she<lb/></p>

She joins<lb/> with her sister &#38; Brother in reiterating<lb/> your kind wishes &#38; remembrances.  Mr. E.
