            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Sympathising friends.  If you anticipate hearing the sound<lb/> of lament&#44; turn look not to me&#44; but turn to those who must naturally<lb/> feel a sorrow intensified by repeated bereavements.  Not ten<lb/> months have elapsed since they laid into the cold grave a father<lb/> who had labored long and hard&#44; to earn for them a competency.<lb/>  Not four months have glided by since they accompanied to<lb/> the place of interment the remains of a dear relative&#44; dear<lb/> to an entire community&#59; and now they are summoned<lb/> by a God whose will is all just yet inscrutable to consign<lb/> to the cold earth the wife of him who had begotten them&#59; their<lb/> mother.  I sympathise with the bereaved by reason<lb/> of their repeated strokes of misfortune.  I am grieved for<lb/> them because had I not even experienced the loss which they<lb/> now sustained&#44; I would find in opening my Bible&#44; that the<lb/> departure from our midst of her that gave us birth brings<lb/> unutterable anguish.  I am sad for their sake&#44; because the<lb/> woman whose funeral obsequies I am called upon to perform<lb/> had reached an age&#44; in which she ought to have enjoyed among<lb/> her children the fruits of early trials in the training of a<lb/> numerous family&#44;&#45;&#45;having exceeded al only by one decade the<lb/> half of our term of life.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Still&#44; I will not give forth complaints.  Did I believe<lb/> that with the dissolution of this corruptible matter<lb/> existence ceased I would might&#44; like a priest of ancient heathens&#44;<lb/> encourage the tearing of our flesh at the decease of those&#44; we<lb/> love or regard.  But the voice of reason which tells me<lb/> that the brain is not the mind proper&#44; but simply the instrument<lb/> of human thoughts&#44; nor is the heart the cause of our senti&#45;<lb/>ments&#44; but merely the agent of our feelings&#44; is joined by the voice<lb/> of religion which assures me that when my body is consumed&#44;<lb/> I shall survive its decay&#44; through the author of my soul&#44;<lb/> the God Eternal.  He has not blessed us with so many<lb/> faculties&#44; that we might perish like the beasts of the field.<lb/>  If the destruction of our spirit is an impossibility&#44; why should<lb/> I bewail and moan&#63;  It is natural for the bereaved to weep&#59;<lb/> it is incumbent on their guide to lift up the afflicted by<lb/> celestial promises.  The faithful and industrious wife&#44; the<lb/> devoted mother and virtuous social being has gone to her<lb/> lasting reward.  True&#44; when we measure her years by<lb/> our mete&#45;yard&#44; we will judge them too short.  They<lb/> upon whom she bestowed maternal affection&#44; might have<lb/> wished that she had spoken a tender word&#44; and bid them<lb/> farewell upon earth&#44; before death arrived.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>But the consideration that she was spared the terror agony of<lb/> a parting with the a world&#44; in which she left her dear ones&#44; of dear associations&#44;<lb/> ought to be a source of consolation comfort.  To lament on my part<lb/> would be unseeming and irreligious.<lb/></p>
            <p>I do often grieve&#44; not so much for those who have early<lb/> gone to reap a elsewhere a harvest of pleasures&#44; but for<lb/> many they have left behind&#44; to who sow broadcast the seeds<lb/> of evil.  I am sad when I contemplate the laxity of prin&#45;<lb/>ciples among mortal beings&#44; when I see men try to over&#45;<lb/>&#45;reach one another&#44; to mutually blacken their characters&#44;<lb/> to act with deceit&#44; and all with the view of gathering garnering<lb/> what they may be compelled suddenly to leave&#44; before they<lb/> had time to taste the delights which they fancied it would procure.<lb/>  Dost thou not know my brother&#44; that the morrow may not<lb/> be thine&#63;  Why wilt thou fatigue thyself ignobly&#44; gathering<lb/> what may prove naught but faggots wherewith to burn con&#45;<lb/>&#45;sume the peace of thy mind&#44; and the joys of thy heart&#63;<lb/>  My friends&#33;  Occasions like the present are always cal&#45;<lb/>&#45;culated to awaken solemn thoughts&#44; for as we are<lb/> placed face to face with death&#44; we realize the fact that<lb/> life ought to be spent usefully&#44; blessedly.  But not unfre&#45;<lb/>&#45;quently is the impression fleeting&#44; abiding with us a moment until the corpse is lowered into its<lb/> final dwelling&#45;place.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Oh let it not be so in this instance.  I call upon you specially<lb/> children of Mrs Rosa Oppenheimer.  She who suffered in watching<lb/> over your health&#44; who endured privations to rear you virtuously<lb/> yearns still for the tokens of your love.  You will pray that<lb/> she be happy&#44; and she will rejoice in the filial thought.<lb/>  You will deny yourselves pleasures for a time to mourn over<lb/> her whose decease has created a void in your midst&#44; and<lb/> she will appreciate your actions.  But that which will afford<lb/> her soul ineffable gratification will be your future conduct.<lb/>  The harmony of your feelings&#44; as members of her household.<lb/>  Your uprightness as members of the social family&#44; your<lb/> piety as Israelites&#44; your good example as relatives&#44; your<lb/> charity&#59; your philanthropy&#44; your greatness in whatever<lb/> ennobles y human nature.  Better than when<lb/> she moved her below&#44; she understands now how man<lb/> can <sic>fulfil</sic> the will of his Creator&#44; and she beseeches you<lb/> at this hour&#44; to honor her memory by glorifying the Eternal<lb/> God &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;who hath given us this soul&#34;<lb/>  Heed the maternal injunction&#44; ye her Chl children.<lb/>  I am its interpreter.
