            <p>For the Sabbath after the 4th of July 1876<lb/></p>
            <p>Lord God&#33;  The men who served Thee with unswerving<lb/> fidelity&#44; have taught the world a lesson&#44; which we&#44; Thy<lb/> suppliants&#44; hasten to carry out in Thy Divine presence.<lb/>  They instructed us to thank Thy name&#44; before enjoying<lb/> the tokens of Thy favors&#44; and to return thanks unto<lb/> Thee&#44; after having been made glad with Thy celestial<lb/> bounties.  The Sages of Thy people&#44; whom Thou didst<lb/> endow with keen discernment&#44; knowing how prone<lb/> is the human mind to forgetfulness&#44; and how apt it is to<lb/> consider itself the sole author of temporal happiness&#44;<lb/> have directed us in a manner which we will humbly<lb/> perform.  This Sabbath we enter Thy holy habitation<lb/> with words on our lips&#44; expressive of sentiments akin to<lb/> those which we uttered on the Sabbath that has passed.<lb/>  Anticipating an event brimful of joy to a nation<lb/> Thou hast formed&#44; signally protected&#44; and exceedingly<lb/> extolled&#44; we laid then upon Thy altar&#44; offerings of<lb/> gratitude.  And now that the occasion has realized<lb/> the glowing hopes it inspired&#44; now that it called forth<lb/> an intensity of pleasure among free millions&#44; and it<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>made the air vocal with their shouting from sea<lb/> to sea&#44; we rehearse Thy praise&#44; O beneficent God&#44; who<lb/> didst bring that auspicious occasion to pass.  May<lb/> its effect have been so salutary&#44; so lasting and far&#45;<lb/>&#45;reaching&#44; that after a <sic>millenial</sic> cycle of years&#44; our<lb/> latest posterity shall experience it in all its fulness.<lb/>  The fire of poetry it enkindled&#44; the impassioned oratory<lb/> it evoked&#44; the universal outburst of enthusiasm it pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;duced&#44; will then be looked upon as a foreknowledge<lb/> of a happiness to generations yet to be born.  For we believe that<lb/> only to accomplish the most merciful of Paternal deeds<lb/> hast Thou&#44; O Lord&#33; set America&#44; the youngest of nations&#44;<lb/> prominently&#44; even to advance the cause of humanity&#44;<lb/> which is the cause of religion.  In the same manner<lb/> as the riches of single individuals&#44; and their talents&#44; when<lb/> jealousy kept for selfish purposes&#44; may be likened<lb/> to a choice plant in an uninhabited region&#44; whose fruits<lb/> and whose fragrance none can enjoy&#44; so do we regard<lb/> as futile and vain in achievements of a whole people&#44;<lb/> that do not tend to benefit Thy less favored creatures.<lb/>  But America has&#44; under Thy heavenly guidance&#44; em&#45;<lb/>&#45;ployed the gifts showered down thereupon&#44; as instruments<lb/> of deliverance and exaltation.  She has lent all<lb/></p> 
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>inherent vigor to upraise an enslaved race&#44;<lb/> so that clanking of chains&#44; and the sound of woes<lb/> might not jar with the anthem of freedom.  The sciences<lb/> she cultivated&#44; brought closer nation unto nation&#44; and<lb/> very nigh annihilated space&#44; to prepare the way for<lb/> a kingdom of peace upon earth&#44; and of glory unto Thee&#44; who<lb/> dwellest in heaven.  Therefore crowned heads bow&#44; and<lb/> from exalted thrones a voice issues forth calling America&#44;<lb/> &#34;the good and the great.&#34;  May she prove worthy of that<lb/> title to the end of time.  We fervently pray Thee for that<lb/> boon&#44; O watchful God&#33; for&#44; our hearts at times&#44; flutter be&#45;<lb/>&#45;tween hope and fear.  We behold men anxious to rob this<lb/> land of her shining lustre&#44; and cover her face as with a pall.<lb/>  Men who would bring about an alliance destructive in its tendency&#44;<lb/> fatal in its results.  Already have we&#44; a residue of Thy people&#44;<lb/> felt their insidious arts&#44; and we look up unto Thee that<lb/> canst thwart the intentions of those who aim to do us evil.<lb/>  Thou canst awaken a generous people to the danger they<lb/> are exposed&#44; and they will rise in all the majesty of their<lb/> power&#44; to defend inalienable rights.  Grant it O Lord&#33;<lb/>  And as we blessed Thy name before the glorious event just celebrated<lb/> and thanked Thee after its consummation&#44; so will we sing Thy<lb/> praises in this country&#44; wherein our happy lot was cast&#44; henceforth &#38;<lb/> evermore.  Amen.<lb/></p>
