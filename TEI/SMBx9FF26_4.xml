            <p>For Bammidbar<lb/></p>
            <p>Divine Legislator&#33;  When the to signalize the beginning of<lb/> the second year of our fathers&#39; deliverance from bondage freedom<lb/> Thou gavest the command that they should be numbered<lb/> and arranged into four great divisions&#44; each of these bore<lb/> aloft the banners unfurled in honor of Thy name.  It was<lb/> while the tribes encamped&#44; in the order prescribed by Thy<lb/> inspired messenger&#44; that the heathen magician sum&#45;<lb/>moned from Syria to utter a malediction&#44; rested his eye<lb/> upon our ancestors.  Beholding them from afar&#44; under<lb/> the broad folds of standard national flags&#44; distinguished&#44; from one another&#44;<lb/> as tradition teaches&#44; by varied colors and devices&#44; he was<lb/> impelled to praise and bless&#44; what he had been hired for<lb/> to despise and curse.  &#34;How beautiful are thy tents O Jacob&#33;<lb/> thy dwellings O Israel&#33;  As streams they are spread out&#44; as<lb/> gardens by the river&#45;side&#44; as aloe&#45;trees which the Lord hath<lb/> planted&#44; as cedar&#45;trees besides the waters&#34;  In this language&#44;<lb/> recorded in Thy sacred volumes&#44; the wizard&#44; illumined<lb/> with flashes of Thy heavenly light&#44; pointed to the scene<lb/> stretched before his vision.  But a notable object was<lb/> missing in the grand vista open to his prophetic view.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>The family from whom Thy godly Moses sprung&#44; could<lb/> not be discovered among those whose flags standards floated<lb/> through the air.  Had the Levites broken faith with<lb/> this&#63;  Or&#44; hadst Thou&#44; O Sovereign Ruler&#33; cast away a<lb/> portion of Thy redeemed children&#63;  Nay&#58; the man<lb/> Thou drewest nearer unto Thy heart&#44; Thou madest<lb/> remarkably to stand aside from the multitude.<lb/>  Thy Tabernacle was the pavilion which hid the tribe<lb/> of Levy form public gaze.  There&#44; their post of honor<lb/> lay.  For&#44; when the sin of the molten calf defiled Israel&#44;<lb/> and the first&#45;born&#44; chosen to Thy service on the memor&#45;<lb/>&#45;rable night of Egypt&#44; went also astray&#44; Thou didst<lb/> hallow instead those who remained steadfast to<lb/> Thy covenant.  Therefore the three main branches<lb/> of Levy&#44; divided according to their respective families&#44; were<lb/> numbered separately from the rest of the nation&#44; and<lb/> were severally assigned ministerial duties.  Them<lb/> alone Thou didst empower to opened and closed and carryd the portable sanc&#45;<lb/>&#45;ctuary&#44; they held its vessels in their safe&#45;keeping&#44;<lb/> and they had the exclusive charge of the ark of<lb/> Thy covenant testimony.  All this we learn form the pages<lb/> of Thy written book&#44; out of which we have read this Sabbath.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>But from oral instruction we have drawn moreover the<lb/> knowledge that they men of Levy were especially privileged to<lb/> ascend the sacred Desk and offer Thee adoration in choral<lb/> songs&#44; while the priests officiated at the altar.<lb/>  Thou&#44; O Lord&#33; wast their banner of the men of Levy&#44; and that<lb/> they lifted high.  They had no inheritance in the land of<lb/> promise&#44; but Thou didst declare Thyself their peculiar heritage.<lb/>  It is because of the halo cast&#44; in the days of old&#44; round the<lb/> tribe of Moses&#44; that we still show its members tokens of<lb/> distinction in our minor sanctuary.  And truly&#44; when we<lb/> consider their <sic>marvellous</sic> preservation&#44; despite the loss of<lb/> the largest number of our people&#44; and a long and far&#45;<lb/>reaching dispersion&#44; it must seem but agreeable to Thy<lb/> Divine will&#44; that we accord to the Levites religious privileges preferences&#44; suitably<lb/> to ancient usages.  May our fellow&#45;believers of that tribe&#44;<lb/> be deemed&#44; in Thy sight&#44; deserving of the consideration of their<lb/> brethren.  Sensible of Thy mercy by in granting them an<lb/> indestructible existence&#59; appreciating the honors we bestow on<lb/> them&#44; may such of our coreligionists of that tribe&#44; who as who belong to that family&#44; and worship in our<lb/> midst&#44; be noted for their noble bearing in society&#44; for their do&#45;<lb/>mestic virtues&#44; and piety.  May their name be ever asso&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciated with those who reverence Thee O Eternal&#33; as it is written &#34;O house<lb/> of Levy bless the Lord&#58; Ye that fear the Lord&#44; bless ye the Lord.&#34;  Amen.<lb/></p>
