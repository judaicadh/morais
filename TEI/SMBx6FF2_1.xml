            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>DEAR SIR&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>In obedience to the generally expressed opinion that there was urgent need for the maintenance of<lb/> a seat of Jewish learning in New York City&#44; the center of Judaism in America&#44; the Jewish Theological<lb/> Seminary Association was organized five years ago.<lb/></p>
            <p>The need was recognized as urgent&#44; because it was felt that Rabbis and teachers trained in this<lb/> country&#44; surrounded  by the intellectual and moral influences of this land&#44; and imbued with the spirit of<lb/> American institutions&#44; can better thoroughly reach the heart of Jewish youth and enter into sympathy with<lb/> the spiritual life and thought of our time and people.<lb/></p>
            <p>Since then the need of such a seminary has become intensified by the enormous Jewish immigration<lb/> from Russia in recent years.<lb/></p>
            <p>The most effectual method of carrying on the necessary work of Americanization in its best and<lb/> highest sense&#44; is by sending among them religious guides who will command their respect by their Hebrew<lb/> learning and their religious fervor&#44; and who will effect the social elevation of their brethren by the culture<lb/> and refinement of their customs&#44; habits&#44; speech and demeanor.<lb/></p>
            <p>The importance of maintaining such an educational institution should receive universal recognition.<lb/>  The Faculty and Trustees of the Jewish Theological Seminary have put forth every effort to develop the<lb/> institution in consonance with the best and most approved modern collegiate methods&#44; and in a manner<lb/> to meet the needs of the Jewish pulpit and school&#45;room in America.  Every student of the Seminary is<lb/> required to secure a thorough secular collegiate training&#44; and to evince a special aptitude for a ministerial<lb/> career or for the exercise of teaching functions&#59; and the object of the Seminary is to provide him with the<lb/> facilities for training this aptitude and developing these functions.<lb/></p>
            <p>After five years of experience and progress&#44; the necessity confronts the trustees of enlarging the<lb/> facilities of the Seminary.  There is need for an increase in the teaching staff.  A well&#45;equipped working<lb/> library is an urgent necessity&#44; and so is the provision of a building properly fitted for the purposes of the<lb/> Seminary.<lb/></p>
            <p>In order to meet these needs we appeal to the Jewish community for early and adequate financial<lb/> assistance.  We have hitherto refrained from making any extensive and organized appeal to the public.<lb/>  We now feel justified&#44; however&#44; in presenting our claim to the support of the Jewish community in behalf<lb/> of our educational institution&#44; which&#44; as a seat of learning&#44; should be a source of pride to our people and an<lb/> element of assurance for the future weal of Judaism in America.<lb/></p>
            <p>The existence of two such scholarly seats of learning in our city as the General Theological Semi&#45;<lb/>nary of the Protestant Episcopal Church and the Union Theological Seminary of Presbyterian proclivities&#44;<lb/> should inspire the Jewish community to earnest efforts to place the Jewish Theological Seminary on a plane<lb/> of equal efficiency with its sister institutions.<lb/></p>
            <p>On the basis of the recent census Dr. Billings&#44; who had charge of vital statistics&#44; estimates that of<lb/> the half a million Jews in this country fully one&#45;third are resident in this city.<lb/></p>
            <p>This is sufficient to indicate how urgent is the need for making suitable provision for the religious<lb/> education of this vast multitude&#44; and to demonstrate how capable such a community is to adequately sup&#45;<lb/>port the Seminary&#44; which is the practical instrument for assuring the training of those who are to carry on<lb/> this task of education in America.<lb/></p>
            <p>Our brethren in other cities&#44; especially Philadelphia and Baltimore&#44; have contributed a notable share<lb/> hitherto in supplying the money necessary for the maintenance of the Seminary.  The time has come when<lb/> our co&#45;religionists in New York City itself&#44; where it is situated&#44; should vindicate their reputation for gener&#45;<lb/>osity in all that pertains to philanthropy and education&#44; and in larger numbers and in a more liberal<lb/> manner&#44; contribute to the funds of this organization in order that its usefulness may be increased.<lb/></p>
            <p>The pupils of the Seminary are at present divided into three classes&#44; which are held at Cooper<lb/> Union&#44; Room 22.<lb/></p>
            <p>There are six in the preparatory class&#44; ranging in age from thirteen to fifteen years&#44; and who have<lb/> pursued their studies in the Seminary during one or two terms.  In the Junior Grade there are three<lb/></p>
                
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>pupils&#44; varying in age from fifteen to seventeen years&#44; who have been connected with the Seminary about<lb/> two years.<lb/></p>
            <p>In the Senior Class there are four pupils&#44; aged from seventeen to twenty years&#44; who have been<lb/> engaged in the pursuit of their studies at the Seminary two and three years.<lb/></p>
            <p>Of these students eleven are from New York and two from Philadelphia.<lb/></p>
            <p>Five were either born in the United States&#44; or brought here in early childhood.<lb/></p>
            <p>There are three students attending the sessions of the preparatory class who have not yet had been regu&#45;<lb/>larly admitted.<lb/></p>
            <p>It is possible that the first fruits of the efforts of the Seminary will be made manifest to the Jewish<lb/> community by the graduation of a class in three years.<lb/></p>
            <p>It is hoped that after reading this appeal you will be inspired with the wish to aid the Seminary by<lb/> contributing to its support.<lb/></p>
            <p>Membership is open to every Jew and Jewess&#44; and to every Jewish congregation and kindred<lb/> association.<lb/></p>
            <p>Patrons pay &#36;10 annually.<lb/></p>
            <p>Subscribers pay &#36;5 annually.<lb/></p>
            <p>Life patrons pay &#36;200.<lb/></p>
            <p>Life subscribers pay &#36;100.<lb/></p>
            <p>Donations of &#36;500 entitle the donor to Honorary Life Patronship.<lb/></p>
            <p>Scholarships may be founded upon the payment of &#36;2&#44;500&#44; and Fellowships upon the payment of<lb/> &#36;5&#44;000.<lb/></p>
            <p>If you are willing to aid the Seminary&#44; please fill out blank spaces on enclosed postal&#45;card&#44; and<lb/> forward to DANIEL P. HAYS&#44; Secretary&#44; 721 Lexington Avenue&#44; New York.<lb/></p>
