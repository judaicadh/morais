            <p>A lecture for the<lb/>
                Sabbath before Passover<lb/>
                &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;A perpetual fire shall burn upon the altar&#44; it shall<lb/> not go out.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>The burnt&#45;offering was consuming the whole<lb/> might upon the altar&#44; but the fire beneath it continued<lb/> to blaze.  So likewise&#44; my beloved hearers&#33; ought the<lb/> flame of religion to remain unquenched within us&#44; though<lb/> we be sorely beset by trials. our flesh and our bones be wearing away under sore trials.  No sufferings<lb/> could equal those borne by our ancestors in the gloomy<lb/> days of bondage&#44; but within the bodies scourged and torn&#44;<lb/> there dwelt souls glowing with faith &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;God will surely visit you&#34;.  The sound of those words<lb/> reverberated still.  Closed in death were the lips that<lb/> had uttered them&#44; but the hope those words had inspired<lb/> lived and vivified the afflicted.  Israel&#45;&#45;<lb/> enslaved Israel&#45;&#45;believed that the shades of a dreary<lb/> night&#44; would be chased away by the dawning of a bright<lb/> morning&#44; and they sunk not beneath under the weight of<lb/> oppression.<lb/></p>
            <p>Why then do we so often despond and wail&#63;<lb/>  The tide of prosperity may have momentarily caused to<lb/> flow.  Unforeseen cl calamities may have caused<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>us sorrow&#44; but if supported by faith&#44; we shall<lb/> rise above the dismal present&#44; to see that a wise<lb/> and beneficent Being directs all human events.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;The just lives by his faith&#34;.<lb/>  This pithy sentence of the prophet&#44; has been rightly<lb/> interpreted as the summary of our duties.  And<lb/> our every action&#44; my Brethren&#33; should prove that so<lb/> we likewise understand it.  Unshaken must<lb/> be our faith in Him the Being&#44; whose eyes know experience neither<lb/> slumber nor sleep.  Then would we cling to Him<lb/> more than to life.  Then would our soul rejoice&#44; though<lb/> feeble nature weeps.<lb/></p> 
            <p>But this sustaining prop is fast decaying.  This<lb/> faith&#45;&#45;which is not blind credulity&#44; but deep conviction<lb/> derived form the conf contemplation of the universe&#44; and<lb/> the study of history&#45;&#45;this faith which upheld our<lb/> fathers midst the severest ills of life&#44; is now bartered<lb/> for a knowledge that profits naught.  We are<lb/> taught the art of divesting of its sacredness what&#45;<lb/>&#45;ever has been heretofore held in regarded with veneration.  Our puny<lb/> minds have learnt to cast doubts on that to which<lb/> towering intellects bowed reverentially.  Aye&#44; even<lb/> the approaching festivals&#44; once the source of joys<lb/></p>

            <p>inexpressible&#44; the Passover&#44; I say&#44; the celebration of<lb/> which&#44; kept afresh the love of home&#44; the love of na&#45;<lb/>&#45;tionality&#44; while it kindled anew sentiments of gratitude<lb/> to the Supreme&#44; is indifferently observed if not totally disregarded.<lb/>  The unleavened bread is purchased&#44; but what does that<lb/> avail&#44; when the leaven of religious indifference is still<lb/> fermenting&#63;  Much is done by us&#44; for the sake of<lb/> conformity&#44; but how much is felt of that inspired<lb/> narrative&#44; which pictures a people wrested from<lb/> slavery by the hand of God&#44; guided&#44; nourished&#44; instructed<lb/> by the Almighty Creator&#44; and miraculously pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;served as the apostles of His truths&#63;  How much<lb/> nearer does the Passover bring us to the Lord&#44; how<lb/> much closer to our hearth&#45;stones&#44; and to the hearts of our<lb/> brethren&#63;  Yet&#44; the main object of its celebration<lb/> should be to fasten the bond which links Israel<lb/> together.  Each festival should indeed be a renewal<lb/> of the covenant between us and our living Redeemer&#59;<lb/> for&#44; each is an historical testimony of His primeval<lb/> love for Israel.  Our holidays&#44; my beloved hearers&#33;<lb/> are a silvery chain that connects the present with<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>the wondrous past.  God holds upon His finger&#44;<lb/> the uttermost end of that chain.  To slight those<lb/> solemn days is to sever oneself from the Lord of<lb/> salvation.  Therefore have our sages numbered among<lb/> those who forfeit everlasting happiness the Hebrew<lb/> man who despiseth the festivals &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  For&#44; by the dictum of Holy Writ<lb/> they stand almost parallel in sanctity with the<lb/> Sabbath.  The permission of kindling fire and<lb/> preparing the food needed for the day&#45;&#45;that domestic<lb/> peace be not disturbed&#45;&#45;ought not to be construed<lb/> into a license to desecrate them by all manner of<lb/> work.  Yet&#44; how many are there not who deem<lb/> the festivals&#44; festivities&#63;  Every thing<lb/> proceeds with them as on a day of labor.  The<lb/> usual vocations are followed&#44; the house of prayer<lb/> is not to be visited&#59; only the table&#44; the luxurious<lb/> table shall tell that some special season is<lb/> observed by the Jews.  The mind may<lb/> be left to famish&#44; the palate shall be gratified.<lb/>  But is that to honor God&#63; to eat to satiety&#44;<lb/> and quaff the choicest wines&#63;  Are not the<lb/> holidays called &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#63;  A fitting time for Israel<lb/></p>

            <p>to congregate&#44; that they may be edified and<lb/> spiritualized by the sacred communion&#63;<lb/>  True&#44; we learn also that we must gladden on those<lb/> days our entire household&#45;&#45;and a bountiful repast<lb/> may effect that object&#45;&#45;but the performance of<lb/> that obligation cannot be and is not an exemption<lb/> from holier duties.  The Israelite who contemns<lb/> the festivals&#44; does injury to his soul&#44; and lowers the<lb/> dignity of his religion in the sight of the world.<lb/>  I have been told of an instance&#44; in which reckless<lb/> parents bid their sons attend a secular school on<lb/> those solemn occasions.  The teacher inquired of them<lb/> a reason for the absence of several of their coreligionists&#44;<lb/> but they who had in been inspired with no reverence<lb/> for the institutions of their faith&#44; answered that they<lb/> knew of none.  And how should<lb/> the child know&#44; whose father does not distinguish<lb/> between the sacred and the profane&#63;  How should<lb/> the child know&#44; whose mother accompanies him on<lb/> the festivals to the resorts of vain and idle diversions&#44;<lb/> but not to the Sanctuary of the Lord&#44; not when<lb/></p>

            <p>he may learn why he is a Jew&#44; and what is<lb/> required at his hands as a Jew&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>It was once the boast of our people&#44; that their women<lb/> led their children to the Synagogue &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The Rabbins have even said&#44;<lb/> that the redemption of our ancestors from Egypt&#44;<lb/> must be principally ascribed to the merits of the<lb/> women who loved in that age &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;  For&#44; they enlivened the drooping<lb/> spirits&#44; they filled the heart with hope&#44; the mind<lb/> with strength.  They were the <sic>counsellors</sic>&#44; the comfort&#44;<lb/> the joy of enslaved Israel.  They infused courage&#44;<lb/> when to trust seemed sheer madness.  They kept<lb/> the flame of religious faith gloriously glowingly bright&#44;<lb/> because they believed in the declarations of Abraham&#39;s<lb/> God.  Can we also pride ourselves on our wives<lb/> exhibiting a similar demeanour&#63;  Of their displaying<lb/> before their our sons and daughters the beauty of a life<lb/> consistent with the heavenly behests&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>I concede that when denied our cooperation&#44; they<lb/> efforts must be greatly hampered in the efforts.  But a stead&#45;<lb/>&#45;fast determination on the part of the female<lb/> parent&#44; to rear her household in the fear of God&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>may shame the heedless husband&#59; awaken within<lb/> his breast the consciousness of his guilt&#44; and he will<lb/> ultimately join his life&#45;copartner in furthering<lb/> the holy cause she has at heart.  Oh&#33; that<lb/> the women of Israel knew their power for good&#44; and<lb/> would unflinchingly exercise it&#33;  But when<lb/> the mother at home&#44; sows the seeds of impiety&#44; and<lb/> the father abroad plants unrighteousness&#44; the children<lb/> will need be poisoned by noxious weeds.  Such is<lb/> the lamentable condition of many Hebrew families<lb/> in America&#59; therefore is a temple raised to infidelity.<lb/>  The law of Moses&#44; which the prophet Malachi bid<lb/> us this day remember to execute&#44; is declared void only<lb/> to conciliate a rebellious spirit&#44; ill&#45;at ease under<lb/> any restraint.  In the paraphrastic lan&#45;<lb/>&#45;guage of the author of the Haggadah&#44; the child asks&#44;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;What is this religious service im&#45;<lb/>&#45;posed on you&#63;&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;  He does not consider<lb/> himself bound to its performance.  The chains that<lb/> dropped form the arms of Egyptian bondmen&#44; did<lb/> not fetter his limbs.  Free he was born&#59; and<lb/> around his life has Liberty cast her shield.  Thus&#44;<lb/> the sufferings endured by his progenitors to gain<lb/></p>

            <p>him that freedom&#44; are totally ignored.  He will<lb/> not reflect that the redemption&#44; which forms at<lb/> this time&#44; Israel&#39;s subject of song&#44; delivered mankind<lb/> also from the barbarities of heathenism&#59; that unless<lb/> we had been sent forth to spread abroad humanizing<lb/> ideas&#44; the atrocities committed in honor to false gods&#44;<lb/> might yet be ne enacted throughout the habitable<lb/> globe.  And whereas every Hebrew man should<lb/> be proud of his descent&#44; whereas his breast should<lb/> swell with gratitude at having been chosen by<lb/> God as the instrument of universal blessing&#44; and<lb/> he should evince his feelings by a ready acquiescence<lb/> in those ordinances intended to remind him of his mis&#45;<lb/>&#45;sion&#59; the child foreshadowed in the Haggadah&#44; and<lb/> rightly called &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; says&#59; &#34;the past concerns me<lb/> not.  It is but a tale of sorrow.  I will raise a wall<lb/> that shall separate me from it.  The present&#44;<lb/> only the present must occupy my mind.&#34;  But&#44;<lb/> vain thoughts&#33;  As well mightest thou attempt<lb/> to remove the spots from the disk of the sun&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>as to efface the marks of thy identity with Israel.<lb/>  Thou art a Jew.  When thy brethren walk at large&#44;<lb/> thou also mayest proceed without obstructions&#59; but<lb/> if their path be hedged around with thorns&#44; thou<lb/> wilt&#44; like them&#44; be pricked on all sides.<lb/></p>
            <p>The irreligious crews thou holdest will not save<lb/> thee&#44; when the hydra of fanaticism is stirred up.<lb/>  Aye&#44; my beloved hearers&#33;  Not by deserting<lb/> our camp&#44; can we obtain security&#44; but by faithfully<lb/> watching thereat.  Our constancy must ulitma&#45;<lb/>&#45;tely triumph.  We may yet a while be made<lb/> to feel the effects of inveterate prejudice&#44; but<lb/> who would not prefer to suffer for the sake of God&#44; than<lb/> to seek honors in defiance of God&#63;  The time&#45;ser&#45;<lb/>&#45;ving and the changeling&#44; who is honored to day&#44; may<lb/> be despised on the morrow&#44; but he who clings to<lb/> his faith&#44; must at length elicit the admiration of<lb/> the world.  Did I say &#34;of the world&#34;&#63;  No&#44;<lb/> let the world look upon us with abhorrence&#44; mock<lb/> and contemn us&#44; if so it will&#58; the approval of<lb/> our conscience&#44; and the love of our God should be<lb/> our sole aspiration.  That must be the reward we<lb/> shall crave for.  And it will most assuredly be granted.<lb/></p>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Upon you&#44; who fear<lb/> my name&#44; shall the sun of righteousness<lb/> shine.&#34;  The halo of spirituality will encircle<lb/> the brows of those self&#45;denying beings&#44; who<lb/> have labored for God.  Their ills will be remembered<lb/> no more&#44; when that refulgent sun riseth &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Happy&#44; thrice happy those who unflinchingly<lb/> adhere to principles&#59; happy the people whose<lb/> support is the everlasting God.<lb/></p>
