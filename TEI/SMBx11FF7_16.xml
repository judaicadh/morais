            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Neither the laws of nature discretion nor those of our the religion we profess&#44; allow<lb/> me to give full expression to my the sentiments stirring within my breast.  Ac&#45;<lb/>&#45;cording to the rules by which we are guided&#44; fu&#45;<lb/>&#45;neral ceremonies obsequies are prohibited on a scriptural festivals&#44; hence<lb/> the customary days of mourning will be are postponed<lb/> in the present an instance like the present.  But aside from the regu&#45;<lb/>&#45;lations which govern us ritually&#44; and which hinder<lb/> me from speaking as I feel at any length&#44; I feel that I could not let my<lb/> heart give vent to his its sentiments feelings promptings without adding<lb/> to the grief of the bereaved ones.  For the lad<lb/> who has left the earth grew as it were under my eyes&#44; and<lb/> till within a very few years past&#44; I had occasion<lb/> continually to observe his good demeanour&#44; gentle<lb/> disposition&#44; just as I continuously heard of his filial devotion and brotherly affection.<lb/>  The melancholy duty of burying performing the burial service over a youth whom<lb/> I knew to be so well supplied largely endowed with qualities<lb/> calculated to make him a worthy man in every<lb/> relation of life&#44; might draw from my lips ut&#45;<lb/>&#45;terances intensifying the gloom anguish caused by his<lb/> untimely departure.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>In obedience to our practices I shall therefore<lb/> forbear from delivering a funeral address&#44; and<lb/> the fear of making a family&#44; to whom mine is attached&#44;<lb/> still sadder&#44; will also keep me silent touching the void created.  Yet&#44;<lb/> I must try endeavour to give the disconsolate some comfort.<lb/>  It is the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of that a sacred obligation &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> is always becoming&#44; always agreeable to na&#45; discre&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion and religion.  Father of this youth now Alas&#33; enshrouded coffined now deceased a coffin.<lb/>  The sympathy of many friends is doubtless<lb/> appreciated by you&#59; but it will scarcely lighten<lb/> the weight of sorrow under which you now are<lb/> bent.  More than your neighbors&#39; fellow&#45;<lb/>feelings&#44; the excellent traits of your B. must<lb/> afford you some relief of to your mind.  It so often happens&#44; un&#45;<lb/>fortunately&#44; that even earlier than at the<lb/> age of your dear boy&#44; sons give parents cause<lb/> to weep and lament&#44; that you should thank<lb/> God for His mercies.  You have returned<lb/> to Him in complete purity&#44; the precious gift<lb/> He once deigned to bestow.  Your hopes are<lb/> frustrated&#44; but you do not suffer the anguish<lb/> of having given back to his Maker a being<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>covered with the pollution leprosy of vice.  Your en&#45;<lb/>joyment of his association was indeed too short&#44; when<lb/> gauged by our own faulty measure&#44; but that association<lb/> was sweet&#44; free from the alloy of a dread that<lb/> it might change into estrangement by rea&#45;<lb/>&#45;son of evil companions and the counsel of the wicked.  Advisers<lb/> Wipe then your tears&#44; and&#44; while cherishing the<lb/> memory of the dear one son who is being greeted in<lb/> heaven by her that gave him birth&#44; devote<lb/> your thoughts to those whom God has left under<lb/> to your guidance and to your support.  They are all<lb/> deserving of your love and of the further exercise<lb/> of your activity.  By a life of energy and<lb/> moderation you may long be spared to them<lb/> in the fruition of domestic happiness.<lb/></p>
            <p>You daughters of E D C continue to pursue<lb/> the laudable course which has won for you<lb/> many friends.  Your father needs all your<lb/> dutifulness&#44; all your love.  You must endeavour try<lb/> to make the loss which he has sustained less<lb/> grievous by a tokens of filial devotedness&#44; which is always<lb/> so assuaging so soothing to a parent&#39;s lacerated heart.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Aid him in his exertions to chase away gloom and<lb/> render home bright&#44; so that peace may be his<lb/> lot in his advancing years.  And you all who<lb/> have practically exhibited your sympathy with a re&#45;<lb/>&#45;lative in affliction&#44; be to him and to the surviving child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren whom he fondly loves a help at all times&#44; and<lb/> let mutual good will strengthen the ties of consan&#45;<lb/>&#45;guinuity and promote durable joys.<lb/></p>
            <p>But vain are human efforts without Thy countenance O<lb/> Lord&#33;  To Thee we pray for a bereaved family in Israel.<lb/>  Unfathomable are Thy decrees&#44; and who shall dare to<lb/> ask why was the faith of Thy servants was so sorely tried&#63;<lb/>  But we raise our eyes trustingly to Thee whose attri&#45;<lb/>&#45;butes are mercy and loving&#45;kindness and mercy.  Grant that<lb/> each member of this sorrow stricken household may&#44;<lb/> like the psalmist&#44; experience that when an abundance many<lb/> of painful thoughts harrow are awakened in their hearts minds&#44; Thy celestial<lb/> consolations are shall be a delight to their souls.  Receive in Thy embrace that<lb/> which is imperishable in B. D. C and destine for it a<lb/> bliss perennial and perfect with among all the saints and<lb/> righteous who preceded him to the land of spirits.  So may it be righteous and Israel. Amen.<lb/></p>
