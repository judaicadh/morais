            <p>On the Alliance<lb/>89<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Brethren.<lb/>  Naturally I have been anxious to read the contradict&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion of the alleged interview with Baron de Hirsch&#44; as<lb/> promised by Isidore Loeb&#44; secretary of the &#34;Universal<lb/> Israelitish Alliance&#34;.  That trustworthy and scholarly<lb/> Jew&#44; wrote several weeks since&#44; in answer to earnest<lb/> inquiries&#44; that such a contradiction would soon be made<lb/> by the very reporter of the original interview&#44; and it<lb/> would appear in a future number of the Herald&#45;&#45;I sup&#45;<lb/>&#45;pose of the Paris edition of that sensational journal.<lb/>  I have not seen it.  If it was published&#44; it failed<lb/> to reach this side of the Atlantic&#44; where the agitation<lb/> our objectionable utterances&#44; as first related&#44; had its rise.<lb/>  But a Hebrew paper&#44; issued in St. Petersburg&#44; Russia&#44;<lb/> under the title of Ha&#45;Metiz&#45;&#45;&#34;the Advocate&#44;&#34; dated<lb/> February 10th&#44; after alluding to the first original report<lb/> which the editor discredited it proceeds to says&#58; &#34;Now the same inter&#45;<lb/>&#45;viewer denies in the following language&#44; what he stated<lb/> before.  &#40;Baron de Hirsch received letters and telegrams from<lb/> America&#44; as well as from England and other European countries&#44;<lb/> by the hundreds&#44; on the matter of the <sic>despatch</sic> which I sent<lb/> to the Herald in after my talk conversation with the Baron&#44; respecting<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>the amalgamation of Jews and gentiles.  Certain<lb/> expressions which I heard from the Baron during the inter&#45;<lb/>view&#44; were greatly calculated to encourage the a meaning&#44;<lb/> which however is foreign to the thoughts of the Baron.  By reason of<lb/> that&#44; I spoke again this morning with him&#44; and requested<lb/> that he would explain things&#44; which the community at<lb/> large could not exactly understand.  The Baron then said&#58;<lb/> &#39;I have no wish to be suspected of making light of<lb/> subjects which I have always defended advocated&#40;&#63;&#41;&#44; and which I am<lb/> ready to defend advocate&#40;&#63;&#41; at all times.  But as I am much grieved<lb/> to witness the persecution which Jews endure because<lb/> of their race and faith&#44; I wanted openly to tell the Anti&#45;<lb/>&#45;semites that by violently attacking the Jews&#44; they defeat<lb/> their own end&#44; which is to bring about totally or in<lb/> part an amalgamation.  Not by hostility could that<lb/> be accomplished.  On the contrary&#59; such hostility will<lb/> make Jews more and more tenacious in keeping adhering to their laws own rules.<lb/>  Remove every obstacle&#44; give Jews a chance to rise social&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly as they really can&#44; then it may possibly be easier<lb/> for you to accomplish your object.  Witness France<lb/> and England&#44; countries where Jews enjoy perfect equality.<lb/>  There a closer the association between Jews and their neighbors<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>grow closer continually.  Even mixed marriages occasionally<lb/> happen take place.  Thus in the course of ages and their changes all<lb/> may become one integral body&#44; so consequently I think that consequently<lb/> instead of finding fault with the good I do to mankind&#44;<lb/> the Antisemites ought to uphold and help me&#39;&#34;.<lb/>  Now&#44; brethren&#44; this report report conversation which I have translated from<lb/> Ha&#45;Metitz&#44; as literally as I could and which is said to have come<lb/> from Paris to St. Petersburg dated the 5th of February last&#44;<lb/> To me it is confirmed in another Hebrew periodical named Ha&#45;Mag&#39;yed &#34;the Reporter&#34; issued in Lyell&#44; Prussia&#44; and<lb/> dated February the 28th.  To me the would corrections denial or correction is not at all acceptable&#44; and I feel morally bound<lb/> to say so tell it before the congregation who heard me two months<lb/> ago speak in <sic>defence</sic> of Baron de Hirsch.  The contradiction It lacks that directness&#44; that ingeniousness&#44; that Jewishness I would say&#44; which I hoped looked for.  I strongly<lb/> incline to believe that had my lamented friend&#44; the Baron&#39;s<lb/> adviser and almoner&#44; been in Paris and not at Vienna&#44;<lb/> in the interest of Galician Jews&#44; at the time of the un&#45;<lb/>fortunate interview&#44; this would have presented an entirely<lb/> different aspect&#44; for the Baron would have referred the<lb/> inquisitive reporter of the Herald&#44; to chevalier Veneziani&#44;<lb/> &#38; the Leghorn Israelite desired the exaltation of his people&#44; not their extinction to the glory of Christianity Gentilism.<lb/>  But will the designs to benefit Israel educationally<lb/> fall through by reason of the interview and its unsatis&#45;<lb/>&#45;factory construction&#44; or rather modification&#63;  I hope not&#44;<lb/> but I fear that the unacceptable explanation&#44; may work<lb/></p>

            <p>injuriously both in Austria&#45;Poland and Russia&#44; where the<lb/> largest number of our people dwell&#44; and where the intro&#45;<lb/>&#45;duction of a better system of training the young is ab&#45;<lb/>solutely imperative.  I apprehend that it may strengthen<lb/> prejudice against all secular learning as conducive<lb/> to apostasy&#44; and that its inveterate opponents&#44; refusing Baron de Hirsch&#39;s millions may say to him in a Talmudical talk as to the &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;we will have neither the &#91;&#63;&#93; nor the bit sting&#34;  Yet&#44; men and women within reach of<lb/> my voice who love their brethren&#44; and sincerely desire that<lb/> they may compel respect for the sake honor of the God of our<lb/> fathers&#44; have it in their power to lend a blissful<lb/> assistance to that effect.  The &#34;Universal Israelitish<lb/> Alliance&#34;&#44; which at the outset had greatly largely in view the<lb/> political amelioration of the scattered race&#44; has in late<lb/> years <sic>centred</sic> its labors on the instruction of our rising<lb/> generation&#44; settled in ungracious lands.  It is the only<lb/> method by which the ostracised may finally gain the rights<lb/> withheld from them&#44; and bring about&#44; not a fusion<lb/> forbid God&#33; not a fusion destructive of the Sinaic religion&#44; but a recognition of<lb/> human equality in behalf of to citizens who contribute to<lb/> the public welfare.  Were I to discuss before<lb/> my hearers the merits of the Alliance and its claims<lb/> to the cooperation of American Israelites&#44; I would unavoid&#45;<lb/>ably fall into the monotony of self&#45;repetition.<lb/></p>

            <p>So often I have pleaded in behalf of its schools<lb/> planted in Europe&#44; Asia and Africa&#44; and teaching<lb/> thousands to read and write living languages&#44; as means<lb/> to facilitate a social intercourse&#44; the arts of cultivat&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing the ground and following handicraft&#44; as fostering<lb/> self&#45;dependence&#44; the knowledge of industry and cleanliness<lb/> to thousands of Jewish girls&#44; whom unfavorable sur&#45;<lb/>&#45;roundings rear in idleness and squalidity.  Very<lb/> recently&#44; Isidore Loeb&#44; the reliable and sagacious secre&#45;<lb/>&#45;tary of the Alliance&#44; assumed the duty of travel extensively through the numerous<lb/> cities in which the Alliance association exercises its benign its benign<lb/> scholastic influence&#44; so that by personal inspection he<lb/> might ascertain the actual condition&#44; and suggest<lb/> improvements where needed.  In his mind&#44; the history of<lb/> the Alliance is the history of united efforts to defend<lb/> our racial honor against the attacks of malice&#44; envy<lb/> and unscrupulous fanaticism&#59; it is the history of<lb/> mighty strenuous exertions to grapple with ignorance forced upon<lb/> the descendants of prophets and sages by cruel cir&#45;<lb/>&#45;cumstances&#44; the history of longings for a regeneration<lb/> civil and political of a people that have been the<lb/> primary factors in the spreading of civilization.<lb/></p>

            <p>And they who give their mite to aid the far&#45;reaching<lb/> institution in its continually progressive endeavours course&#44; assist in vindi&#45;<lb/>&#45;cating our sacred cause.  Some contend that our<lb/> immediate wants in precisely the same direction are<lb/> so many and so pressing&#44; that we can scarcely feel<lb/> justified in bestowing our means on organizations beyond the<lb/> ocean.  Now&#44; brethren&#44; if the demands from thence were<lb/> extravagantly high&#44; I would recognize and admit the sound&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness of the argument&#44; and forbear to applea to your feelings generosity.<lb/>  I would appreciate at once that if you have fifties and<lb/> hundreds and thousands to spare&#44; you must devote<lb/> them to the elevation of our coreligionists of foreign<lb/> birth who have taken up their homes in Philadelphia&#59;<lb/> that they have precedence to our intelligent sympa&#45;<lb/>&#45;thies&#44; that their young ones must be delivered from<lb/> illiteracy and coarseness and low pursuits.  But the<lb/> contribution to the Alliance is small&#44; two dollars an<lb/>&#45;nually will cover it&#44; and the Purim donation which<lb/> is the Central Committee at Paris solicits&#44; needs not be<lb/> rich.

            <p>our city have considerably reduced it.  Last<lb/> year scarcely any of gift as our Purim greetings to distant<lb/> fellow&#45;believers was sent&#44; if we except that kindly<lb/> forwarded by the pupils of the two Hebrew Sunday<lb/> Schools.  Yet&#44; our remembrances at this festive season<lb/> have a peculiar object&#44; which commends itself to our<lb/> hearts and understanding.  That object is to create anew<lb/> in the Holy Land this spirit that stirred within the<lb/> souls minds of the patriarchs of our race&#44; who made the soil smile<lb/> with plenty under their tillage and culture.  The<lb/> last message which I received from my lamented friend<lb/> Veneziani&#44; and which he dictated to his private secretary&#44;<lb/> when approaching death prevented his writing&#44; was<lb/> in answer to a proposition from Leghorn&#44; which I sub&#45;<lb/>&#45;mitted to his judgment namely that an institution to eternize the memory<lb/> of Baron de Hirsch&#39;s unparalleled philanthropy munificence generosity should be<lb/> established&#44; in some leading city.  Veneziani asked<lb/> to direct my attention to Palestine&#44; and see how<lb/> the scarcity of water exposes it often to dire suf&#45;<lb/>&#45;ferings&#44; and how hydraulic science might relieve<lb/> it effectually&#44; if means if for underground excavations open&#45;<lb/>ing channels and conduits could be secured.  He<lb/> consider the compassing of that end&#44; preferable to any monumental memorial.<lb/></p>

            <p>Let your free will offerings to for that purpose be presented<lb/> to the God who chose Zion as the abode of the Shechinah<lb/> and the seat of prophetic inspiration.  But an<lb/> object even higher loftier than that urges me to plead<lb/> for the Alliance.  I ardently wish that you may signify<lb/> to the world our Jewish solidarity&#44; even as expressed respectively<lb/> expressed in the Hebrew motto and Hebrew name appellation of the association&#44;<lb/> namely that is &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;All Israelites are guaranties<lb/> for each other&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;All Israelites are brethren&#34;<lb/> Our adversaries may call us &#34;clannish&#34; because of the that sense<lb/> of intercommunion&#59; the Goldwin Smiths may rail at<lb/> our feelings as tribal&#59; the Antisemitic Hamans every&#45;<lb/>&#45;where may cry out that a people scattered abroad and<lb/> dispersed among all peoples&#44; have peculiar laws&#44; but we<lb/> shall pride ourselves on the firmness of our religious<lb/> union which is unique&#44; and which leads the happy to<lb/> promote the <sic>welbeing</sic> of the unfortunate&#44; the free among Jews to<lb/> seek the enfranchisement of the enslaved&#44; the en&#45;<lb/>&#45;lightened to place within reach of the untutored the<lb/> light of progress.  May it ever always be so.  May<lb/> never the insidious seductions of egotism never rob us of those<lb/></p>

            <p>fraternal sentiments.  As at this season&#44; Esther<lb/> and Mordecai intended by their enactments to fasten<lb/> our national bonds through acts of mutual good<lb/> will and commiseration&#44; so may we in that spirit ever observe<lb/> Purim communally and congregationally.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;Any additional subscriptions and any donations may<lb/> be sent to my address&#44; or to that of Mr Simon Muhr<lb/> the treasurer of the Philadelphia Branch of the<lb/> &#34;Universal Israelitish Alliance&#34;.&#41;<lb/></p>
