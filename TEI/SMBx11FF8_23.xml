                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>My sympathies are stirred up most profoundly.  Were<lb/> it within reach of my speaking capacity&#44; the desolate<lb/> young widow would be lifted up from her tearful con&#45;<lb/>&#45;dition into a state of serene calmness.  But I acknow&#45;<lb/>&#45;ledge my utter inability to act so effectually and mer&#45;<lb/>&#45;cifully.  It is in such instances as the present&#44; that<lb/> the full force of the Rabbinical maxim is felt &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Try not to console the bereaved&#44; while their dead one is<lb/> lying before them unburied.&#34;  If this corpse awakens<lb/> within me sorrowful emotions&#59; if it recalls events whose<lb/> memory intensifies grief&#44; what must it occasion to her<lb/> whom M. S. conjugally loved&#44; and by whom she was tenderly<lb/> loved in return&#63;  I remember how she clung to her<lb/> husband&#44; when she was deprived of the babe infant to<lb/> whom she first gave birth.  I pitied her&#44; but I could<lb/> say to her&#58; &#34;Find consolation in the affection of your life&#45;<lb/>companion.  Like Elkanah of Scriptural fame&#44; he may<lb/> claim to be to thee better than the children &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Again&#44; I saw her after she pressed a male child to<lb/> her bosom.  She rejoiced&#44; and I shared in her joy.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I asked her to be thankful for the Divine gift.<lb/>  She seemed so happy&#33;  Could she then&#44; could I then&#44;<lb/> who prophesied anticipated predicted forth coming pleasures&#44; have imagined<lb/> what calamity would befall her within eight<lb/> months later&#63;  Aye&#58; she has our sincerest sym&#45;<lb/>&#45;pathies.  But how to bring relief to the troubled soul&#59;<lb/> that is the painful question.  Will we do it by pas&#45;<lb/>&#45;sing in review the merits of our deceased brother&#63; by<lb/> showing that he was respected by reason of his even tem&#45;<lb/>&#45;perament and inoffensive character&#59; by telling that all<lb/> who knew him intimately&#45;&#45;as I have been assured&#45;&#45;ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;preciated his unobtrusive kindness&#44; that they entertain&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed due regard for his willingness to identify himself<lb/> with his people socially and congregationally&#63;<lb/>  These memories might&#44; on the contrary&#44; make the<lb/> loss of such a being severer&#59; harder to bear.  Could<lb/> I address each member of the family of the departed&#44;<lb/> I would beg of them for the sake of the religion that<lb/> bids us turn compassionately to the mourners &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; for the sake of humanity&#44; that has been im&#45;<lb/>&#45;planted within our breast by nature&#39;s God&#44; to be with<lb/> the young creature&#44; so afflicted in the prime of life&#59;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>to aid her&#44; advise her for good&#44; divert her<lb/> mind from her melancholy surroundings and direct<lb/> her thoughts to that channel which will finally&#44;<lb/> I hope and pray&#44; become a source of lasting comfort&#45;&#45;<lb/> I mean to the tender but sensible training of her boy.<lb/>  That babe is the pledge of her devotion to the loved<lb/> dead.  The greater the attention she will bestow upon<lb/> him&#44; the more will she still&#91;&#63;&#93; endeavour to provide<lb/> for him&#44; to supply his physical&#44; mental and moral<lb/> wants&#44; the sooner she will be consoled&#44; the happier<lb/> she will become.  I confess that aside from the<lb/> blessed thought of immortality&#44; from the holy belief that<lb/> the Creator in His mercy will not cut us off from<lb/> an ethereal existence after the terrestrial has ceased&#59;<lb/> that &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#34;the spirit shall return<lb/> unto God who gave it&#44;&#34; that &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;there is a latter end&#44; and our hope will not be<lb/> extinguished&#34; aside&#44; I say&#44; from the voice of religion<lb/> I know of nothing that may restore <sic>tranquillity</sic><lb/> to this hapless daughter of our race&#44; than her care<lb/> for her child.  May her health be equal to the task&#44;<lb/> and for that let us jointly beseech the Omnipotent Lord.<lb/></p>

            <p>&#40;a prayer followed&#41;<lb/></p>
