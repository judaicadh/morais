None of the other<lb/> sketches make less than two quar<lb/>to pages but we cannot obtain<lb/> from Mr Chas H Cohen matter<lb/> sufficient to make one full<lb/> page for his father.  In our per&#45;<lb/>plexity we applied this morn<lb/>ing to Mayer Sulzberger Esq. and<lb/> he advised to address you in<lb/> the belief that you would<lb/> furnish some additional mat<lb/>ter.<lb/></p>

            <p>We enclose what we have and<lb/> beg that you will note.  A<lb/> lengthy extract from the remarks<lb/> you made at his funeral<lb/> would perhaps be appopri<lb/>ate.  We could say<lb/> Rev Dr Morais&#44; who preached<lb/> his funeral sermon said<lb/> of him &#95; &#95;<lb/></p> 
            <p>Hoping that you will be<lb/> able to do this without inconvenience<lb/> and can return the enclosed<lb/> to us with your additions in<lb/> two or three days&#44; as the work<lb/> is nearly finished&#44; I am<lb/> Your very obt servt<lb/> Chas R Deacon<lb/> pr F<lb/></p>

            <p>HENRY COHEN.<lb/></p>
            <p>Henry Cohen&#44; for many years a leading merchant of Philadelphia&#44; was born in London<lb/> England&#44; on July 19&#44; 1810.  There he was educated and remained until his eighteenth<lb/> <sic>yearwhen</sic> he started upon an extensive tour&#44; visiting Africa&#44; Australia and South Amer<lb/>ica.  He returned to his home in 1833 but shortly afterwards took up his residence in<lb/> Paris&#44; where he remained three years during an eventful period in French history.<lb/>  About 1837 he came to the United <sic>Statesand</sic>&#44; after a short stay in New York&#44; he came<lb/> to Philadelphia where he decided to permanently locate and reside.  He began the im&#45;<lb/>portation of English and French stationery&#44; and afterwards established the <sic>manufactur<lb/>ture</sic> of envelopes and lead points.  The business grew to large dimensions and he be&#45;<lb/>came the leading merchant in that line in the city of Philadelphia.  He retired from<lb/> business in 1871 with a competency.<lb/></p>
            <p>Mr. Cohen was a man of more than ordinary culture.  He was a good French scholar<lb/> and a life&#45;long&#44; diligent and discriminating student of English literature.  The lei&#45;<lb/>sure obtained by retirement from business he spent in reading&#44; in travel and in de&#45;<lb/>votion to charitable and other public duties.  He was a strict believer in the Jew&#45;<lb/>ish faith and took great interest in the affairs of the old Portuguese congregation&#44;<lb/> serving as its president for three years.  He ardently espoused the cause of the<lb/> Union during the war&#44; and took an active part in the formation of the Union League.<lb/>  An enthusiastic American citizen he took great interest in the country&#39;s growth and<lb/> the development of its industries&#44; and was a zealous and tireless worker for the suc&#45;<lb/>cess of the great Centennial Exposition of 1876&#44; which was held in Philadelphia.<lb/></p> 
            <p>During all his life he was deeply interested and active in Jewish and general char&#45;<lb/>ities for the relief of the poor and suffering.<lb/></p>
            <p>In 1844 he married Matilda&#44; the daughter of Mr. Lewis Samuel&#44; by whom he had five<lb/> children&#44; two sons and three daughters.  Charles J.&#44; the eldest son&#44; succeeded to<lb/> his father&#39;s business&#44; which he has very successfully conducted.  The younger son&#44;<lb/> John M.&#44; is a practicing lawyer and a member of the Philadelphia bar.  His daughter<lb/> Edith is the wife of Colonel Alfred Cromelien.  His daughter Mary is a writer of ex&#45;<lb/>ceptional ability on subjects of political economy&#44; etc.&#44; and his daughter Katherine<lb/> is a rising young artist&#44; with a decided talent for sculpture.<lb/></p>
            <p>Mr. Cohen died June 20&#44; 1879.<lb/></p>
