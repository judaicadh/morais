            <p>For Behar &#38; Bechukotay<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Unless Thy Law had been my delights&#44; I should then have<lb/> perished in my affliction.  I will never forget Thy precepts&#44;<lb/> for&#44; with them Thou has quickened me.&#34;  Thus did Thy<lb/> inspired Psalmist&#44; O everlasting Legislator&#33; speak in his devotion&#45;<lb/>&#45;al outpourings&#44; and so I exclaim before Thee&#44; in my lowness.<lb/>  Often have I looked for a soul&#45;sustaining knowledge in man&#39;s<lb/> conceptions&#44; but I discovered that the truths they impart&#44; are only<lb/> a reflection of the verities enunciated at Sinai.  For&#44; as the<lb/> lesser orbs borrow their light from the sun&#44; so do human minds<lb/> send forth luminous thoughts&#44; as they approach the lucid stream<lb/> of Thy revelation.  Would that communities as well as<lb/> individuals were irradiated by that ever&#45;shining light.<lb/>  Oh&#33; that Thy word O Lord suggestive of healthful and comforting<lb/> ideas to man&#44; became the guide of nations.  For then many<lb/> grievous evils by reason of which society now groans&#44; would cease<lb/> to exist.  Like in ancient Israel&#44; at the Jubilee&#44; an<lb/> era would be proclaimed throughout the world&#44; when the inborn<lb/> rights of all beings formed in Thy image&#44; would be recognized and<lb/> granted.  For&#44; Thou who art &#34;the God of the spirit of all<lb/> flesh&#34; gavest Thy intelligent creatures the sovereignty of the earth&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>not that they might overreach each other&#44; not that<lb/> the few might lord over the many&#44; but that all should unite in<lb/> affecting the wise beneficent object of their creation&#44; that is&#44; their<lb/> happiness here and hereafter.  To that end&#44; Thou didst<lb/> enact those beneficent wise provisions&#44; with which teem the Scriptural<lb/> sections designated for this Sabbath.  While by the<lb/> Sabbatical year&#44; rural economy was promoted&#44; Thou wouldst foster<lb/> thereby a sentiment of universal brotherhood&#44; for&#44; the servant<lb/> like his master&#44; the stranger in proportionate shares with the<lb/> native&#44; claimed participation of its spontaneous produce.<lb/>  Thou wouldst also supply by it the needy with food&#44; and<lb/> give afford him some respite&#44; whom adversity had consigned into<lb/> the power of exacting creditors.  That period of rest&#44; detach&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing the mind of the laborer from the soil&#44; raised it towards<lb/> Thee&#44; by whose loving kindness the fields are made to smile<lb/> with verdure&#44; and the meadows to grow rich with pasture.<lb/>  For Thou openest Thy goodly treasure&#44; the heavens&#44; to give rain<lb/> in its due season&#44; and vain will prove all human endeavours&#44;<lb/> if Thy blessing&#44; O Supreme Ruler&#33; descends not thereupon.<lb/>  But Thou hast pronounced to let it rest upon those who act<lb/> charitably with their fellow&#45;mortals.  Thou hast<lb/> declared through the purified lips of the son of Amoz&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>that the soul which feels pleasure to see distress relieved&#44;<lb/> shall delight in joys heavenly and perennial.  But Thou O God&#33;<lb/> who hast framed our being&#44; knowest also how the lower instincts of our nature struggle<lb/> at times for the supremacy.  To restrain them&#44; Thou didst represent<lb/> our stay upon earth&#44; as that of strangers and sojourners&#44; ready at<lb/> Thy call to set off for our long home.  To curb sa covetousness&#44; and<lb/> plead the cause of the indigent among Thy children&#44; Thou didst<lb/> denounce usurious dealings as a heinous crime.  To save from bondage<lb/> the unfortunate&#44; who might have surrendered his freedom&#44; to<lb/> avert destitution&#44; Thou didst bid his relatives hasten to his<lb/> deliverance.  And all the statutes comprised in the two<lb/> concluding sections of the book of Leviticus&#44; aim to inculcate<lb/> a love for justice&#44; mercy and humility.  &#34;They are more<lb/> precious than gold&#44; and much fine gold.&#34;  Happy<lb/> they who value them as such&#59; happy the government&#44; that<lb/> inscribes them on its banner.  for&#44; upon the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of<lb/> those ordinances&#44; national success and national peace mainly depend.<lb/>  As it is written concerning Israel &#34;If ye shall walk in my statutes&#44;<lb/> and keep my commandments&#44; then shall you eat bread to<lb/> the full&#44; and dwell safely on your land.  Ye shall lie down&#44;<lb/> with none to make you afraid.  I will turn myself towards you&#44;<lb/> and make you fruitful&#44; and multiply you&#44; and establish my<lb/></p>

            <p>covenant with you.&#34;  Everlasting Lord&#33;  It has been Thy<lb/> will to devote the checkered life of our people as an<lb/> illustration of that truth&#44; for so long as we clung to<lb/> Thy word&#44; the country of our heritage&#44; enjoyed the<lb/> fruition of Thy bounties&#44; but no sooner we swerved from<lb/> its directions&#44; than prosperity fled apace&#44; &#91;&#63;&#93; wars<lb/> arose&#44; and our prolonged exile followed.  Grant&#44; O<lb/> Father of all mankind&#33; that our suffering because of sin&#44;<lb/> may be the healing of the communities among whom we<lb/> dwell.  That they may learn to avoid reverses&#44; by rallying<lb/> round the standard of righteousness.  Grant that the spread<lb/> of social virtues everywhere may speedy the coming of the<lb/> halcyon days&#44; when tyranny shall cease&#44; cruelty shall be heard<lb/> of no more&#59; when the ferocious&#44; allegorized by the wolf&#44; and<lb/> the meek of which the lamb is the symbol&#44; shall lie down<lb/> together&#44; when the lyon typical of him who rules&#44; and the ox<lb/> of him that serves&#44; shall be upon a level&#44; when by our hearts shall not be wrong the cry of the<lb/> oppressed shall not sadden our hearts&#44; and the tears of the<lb/> afflicted shall be wiped from all eyes.  May<lb/> this be Thy divine resolve&#44; and we merit to witness its early accomplishment.<lb/>  Amen.<lb/></p>
