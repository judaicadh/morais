            Kingston Jamaica<lb/>
            17 June 1873.<lb/></p>
            <p>Revd Ribbi<lb/></p>
            <p>With extreme sorrow and<lb/> heartfelt grief&#44; did I receive the<lb/> news of your bereavement.  May<lb/> the Great Creator Console you<lb/> by making your children a comfort<lb/> to you in your declining years<lb/></p>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Many thanks for your kind information<lb/> respecting the &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/>
            With regard to the &#91;Hebrew&#93; what I particu<lb/>&#45;larly desired to know was whether he<lb/> could be married at all.<lb/></p>
            <p>Because among those who are under<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>2<lb/></p>
            <p>the penalty of &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  I find the &#91;Hebrew&#93; named<lb/> The facts are simply these.  Some years<lb/> ago a man <del>of</del> by name Shalom&#44; Committed<lb/> himself with a married woman in consequence<lb/> she was divorced from her husband.  Shalom<lb/> then married her in the church&#44; and they lived<lb/> as man and wife till she died&#44; which was<lb/> about 3 years back.  After which Shalom<lb/> took his niece to live with him in a state<lb/> of concubinage&#59; after she became a<lb/> mother&#44; he applied to the synagogue to<lb/> marry him.  I objected on the grounds&#44;<lb/> as I still think&#44; that a &#91;Hebrew&#93; cannot be<lb/> received in the congregation. &#40;my protest<lb/> still exists.&#41;  However&#44; since Dr Artom<lb/> gave an equivocal decision the vestry<lb/> took upon themselves to marry him&#44; on<lb/> the plea&#44; that if there was any wrong&#44; it<lb/> was on the side of Dr Artom who had<lb/> first decided that he could never be married<lb/> as he had committed a crime both against<lb/> God and man and because the man<lb/> committed himself with his niece&#44; and a<lb/> child was born&#44; he said&#44; you <hi rend="underline">may</hi> marry<lb/> him.  &#34;So that in order to cover one<lb/> crime&#44; a man has only to commit another<lb/> the only deduction to be drawn from<lb/> such a decision.<lb/></p>
            <p>The reason for my laying this before you&#44; is&#44;<lb/> that I <hi rend="underline">fear</hi> I have done wrong by marrying<lb/> him and which fear continually haunts me.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>3<lb/></p>
            <p>My wife and children are thanks to providence<lb/> well.  Also my brother and his wife.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Da Costa brothers beg to be remembered<lb/> to you&#44; and to wish you comfort.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have nothing of any consequence<lb/> to write to you this packet&#44; only<lb/> I long once more to salute you<lb/> personally&#44; for which I shall<lb/> embrace the first fair opportunity.<lb/>  Trusting to hear that you are<lb/> consoling yourself.<lb/></p>
            <p>I remain<lb/>
            Yours dutifully<lb/>
            A H Nieto<lb/>
            &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
                <p>Dear Nieto<lb/></p>
            <p>Philadelphia June 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1873<lb/></p>
            <p>Yesterday &#91;Hebrew&#93; <del>your kind</del> came to hand your kind favor with<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; for which receive my sincere thanks.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am at a loss to understand what is the difficulty about the<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and why Dr Artom hesitated at all in deciding<lb/> <del>at once</del> that he <hi rend="underline">ought</hi> to have been married to his niece.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am ready to plead ignorance&#44; if I am ever&#44; and I always<lb/> wish to stand corrected&#44; but really think that &#91;Hebrew&#93; rather than a<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; would be a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; enabling a great &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> to enter &#91;Hebrew&#93; <del>and</del> removing a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and &#91;&#63;&#93;ing<lb/> away the &#91;&#63;&#93; attached to her offspring.<lb/></p>
            <p>According to my humble opinion I say &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>I am pleased to hear that your family are well&#44;<lb/> Remember me kindly to all&#44; and the Da Costa brothers<lb/> and believe me<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours &#38;c<lb/>
