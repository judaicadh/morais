            <p>Rev. S. Morais&#59;<lb/>
                Dear Sir&#44; Friend &#38; Colleague&#59;<lb/></p>
            <p>I have on Friday last received as Jewess a<lb/> young Lady&#44; which married to a Jew&#44; is about to become a mother<lb/> of a jewish child. I state this fact to you alone&#44; because I wish<lb/> that not even the shadow of a misunderstanding should mar our<lb/> spiritual relationship. I would have  presented the case to the Board<lb/> if the Dr Jastrow would have been here. But as it stands now I had<lb/> personal reasons to refrain from doing so.&#45;&#45;To you I have already<lb/> mentioned the case in question.&#45;&#45; These were two considerations<lb/> that guided me in my action&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>1&#58; The Lady is married to a  member of my Cong. and her father<lb/>in&#45;law is also a member. I was positively told&#44; that should said Lady<lb/> not be received and the young man move to his father&#45;in law&#44; he<lb/> would soon be estranged to his folks and his people. To that end both<lb/> father &#38; son would sever their <sic>conection</sic> with any Congr.<lb/></p>
            <p>2&#58; The <sic>legaly</sic> married wife is about soon to become a mother.<lb/> She herself wishes that child to be raised in the jewish faith. The parents<lb/> have seen me <sic>personaly</sic> and given their full consent&#8212;I possess that in&#45;<lb/>strument in writing&#45;&#45; that their daughter may follow in the ways<lb/> of her husband. The young woman&#44; born here&#44; is a well educated lady<lb/> who diligently studied what I gave her to read.<lb/></p>
            <p>Even <del>under</del> these considerations would not have induced<lb/> me to act alone in the  matter&#44; I had already stated to Mr. &#91;&#63;&#93; that<lb/> I will place the matter before the B.of M. as soon as Dr. J. would return<lb/> and urge her acceptance before the coming holy days&#59; but then during<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>the last week the parties feared a primative &#91;&#63;&#93; and this placed me<lb/> in a predicament which I could not overcome but in one way.<lb/></p>	
            <p>To <sic>safe</sic> the peace in that family and also not to lose the<lb/> members of my Congr. I allowed her to go to the Ritual Bath &#91;Hebrew&#93; and<lb/> there is the presence of reliable witnesses&#44; after solemnly promising<lb/> to become a true daughter  &#38; mother of Israel&#44; I received her a Jewess<lb/> and gave her the name of &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and issued a Certificate&#44; stating<lb/> the circumstances under my own name.<lb/></p>
            <p>As said in the beginning I communicate these facts<lb/> to You&#44; in order to be judged accordingly&#44; should the matter come to<lb/> your knowledge by others.<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours very truly<lb/>
                &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/></p>
