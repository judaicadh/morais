            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Prophecy points to this coffin for a perfect illustration of its teaching.  &#34;The<lb/> righteous shall live by his faith.&#34;  To destroy what constitutes man&#39;s real<lb/> existence&#44;&#45;&#45;dignity of character&#45;&#45;&#44; a sea of trouble surged up against<lb/> my late brother and friend.  It foamed and raged&#44; but it could not drag him&#44;<lb/> whose abiding strength was faith&#44; into the whirlpool where many have<lb/> been lost.  Harassing doubts on the justice of Providence&#44;&#45;&#45;doubts<lb/> that wither the soul&#45;&#45;; unbelief&#44; rising at times from amidst sore trials&#44;<lb/> and casting itself into the arms of vice&#44; did not find a harbor where faith<lb/> sat enthroned.  M. A. Mitchell sustained the saddest<lb/> of bereavements&#44; to a man who loves chastely and deeply&#44; while the bloom<lb/> of youth had scarcely mellowed into a riper age.  Early left without<lb/> the being&#44; in whose sweet companionship he had sought pure joys&#44; he<lb/> wound her memory round his heart&#44; and with each throbbing responded<lb/> to the maternal wish that her offspring might enjoy ease through<lb/> their father&#39;s endeavours.  But how fierce the battle against besetting difficulties&#33;<lb/>  Now overcome anon conquering&#44; he was again assailed with greater violence&#59;<lb/> yet&#44; he my lamented friend bore reverses with dignity.  Faith upheld him in the struggle&#59;<lb/> faith preserved his manhood.  And if he could not lay before his<lb/> children a large substance&#44; he offered the best <sic>yeilding</sic> of his labor&#44;<lb/> seasoned always with an abundance of affection.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>In this manner did a believing Israelite devote a life short but<lb/> checkered to benefit his household&#44; and&#44; for a series of years&#44; to relieve<lb/> the needy&#44; as the trusty almoner of his brethren.  Confessedly upright<lb/> in his daily walks&#44; the sterling qualities leading virtue of his character shone still<lb/> more brightly when approaching death struck a blow that laid him prostrate.<lb/>  Then the principles that had guided him were palpably revealed.  Then<lb/> the secret sprung impelling him to act was brightly visibly mirrored forth.<lb/>  Five days the  body tenaciously clung to earth&#44; while the mind had very<lb/> nigh departed.  But a flash of reason consciousness would at intervals brighten light up<lb/> the intellect and palpably show that the righteous man had lived by his faith.<lb/>  Prayer had ever proved his counsel&#44; his comfort and delight&#44; and to<lb/> it he our brother instinctively turned the last thoughts.  To utter and to hear<lb/> prayer&#44; was a desire signified in every motion&#44; when speech failed.<lb/>  By communion with God his soul had remained unpolluted&#44; and by that<lb/> holy means agency it wafted its flight to the regions of eternity.  Let us call<lb/> beautiful the religion which supports mortal beings in all vicissi&#45;<lb/>&#45;tudes&#44; which robs death of its terrors&#44; and smooths the passage<lb/> to the unknown world.   But I recognize surpassing beauty<lb/> in Judaism because it also awakens sympathy sentiments which finds<lb/> expression in deeds of noble self&#45;denial.  I shall not instance<lb/> a love to the living and the dead evinced by nineteen year&#39;s ab&#45;<lb/>&#45;negation.  She who postponed the ease which creeping old age<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>and its attending ailments&#44; demanded to the guardianship of her motherless<lb/> grand&#45;children and the assistance of their disconsolate surviving parent&#44; might deem any allusion to it a gratuitous praise<lb/> very distasteful and unacceptable.  I will keep silent likewise respecting the tangible<lb/> signs of brothers&#39; and sisters&#39; attachment to my lamented friend&#44;<lb/> that I may not change obsequies into an ill&#45;toned eulogy.<lb/>  And what could I say of the dutifulness of son and daughters&#44;<lb/> which is not but natural&#44; and as testified by streaming tears&#63;<lb/>  But this will I say&#44; in honor of the ancestral religion.  Men and wo&#45;<lb/>&#45;men in Israel not so closely connected with the deceased&#44; as those to<lb/> whom I have had reference&#59; nay&#44; even strangers to M A Mitchell&#44;<lb/> save in the profession of common origin and belief&#44; exhibited so<lb/> great an anxiety to share in the family trials created by his ill&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness that I&#44; who witnessed it&#44; felt grateful to God for having<lb/> been taught a religion&#44; breathing such genuine affection and<lb/> commiseration.  Oh&#33; let us always&#44; my dear fellow&#45;be&#45;<lb/>&#45;lievers&#44; illustrate the imparting of that blessed faith.  Let us<lb/> illustrate it by relieving each others&#39; burden before we are threatened<lb/> with being crushed under its weight.  Since we are but <sic>travellers</sic>&#44; wending<lb/> our steps to the same final destination&#44; let us help one another to reach<lb/> it securely and calmly without falling by the way because unaided and uncared for.<lb/>  Let ours be not a spasmodic affection sympathy&#44; but a deep&#45;felt&#44; constant and ever active<lb/> sympathy commiseration and human kindliness.<lb/></p>

            <p>&#34;Comfort ye&#34; will I exclaim in the language of Scripture&#44;<lb/> &#34;Comfort ye&#34; those of my people who mourn.  Speak<lb/> to the hearts of the bereaved.  Seek from the Almighty<lb/> the power to assuage the sorrows of the afflicted&#44; and the<lb/> fatherless.  And they departed who preceded us to the land abode of spiri bliss&#44; contemplating from<lb/> heaven the goodness of the dwellers on earth&#44; will<lb/> by prayer propitiate forgiveness and grace from the<lb/> Lord&#44; that rules over the living and over the dead.<lb/>  And thou Spirit of my departed friend&#44; that hast been lifted up<lb/> by prayer&#44; rise to contemplate thy reward at the foot of<lb/> the throne of the uncreated Being&#44; whose praises the morning<lb/> stars sing together&#44; and all the sons of God echo forth.<lb/></p>
