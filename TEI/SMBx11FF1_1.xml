            <p>109</p>
            
            <p>About the folly of teaching the Bar Mitzvah<lb/>
                naught but a chapter by rote.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  A portion of the service&#44; which I thought it advisable<lb/> for a short time to suspend&#44; is at length resumed upon the Sabbath.<lb/>  I am aware that in American Judaism&#44; the sermon forms the<lb/> kernel of the worship&#44; and the ritual the shell.  But<lb/> what some praise highly as an improvement&#44; I regard as a just<lb/> cause for a complaint.  Where schools exist&#44; in which the written<lb/> and the oral Law find expounders&#44; preaching&#44; in the ordinary sense&#44;<lb/> is rare.  The fire of religion needs not be kept up then by the<lb/> rhetorical fuel which the rhetoric of the pulpit orator furnishes.  In the school<lb/> room are the feelings warmed&#44; and the minds brightened.  Both<lb/> young and old&#44; draw out of that repository of sacred learning&#44;<lb/> the knowledge obligatory upon all to procure.  We&#44; the inhabit&#45;<lb/>&#45;ants of this country&#44; have a palpable deficiency of institutions<lb/> devoted to that all&#45;essential purpose.  Hence&#44; the practice of<lb/> weekly addressing the assembled worshippers&#44; enjoys great po&#45;<lb/>&#45;pularity.  I do not deprecate it&#44; on the score of innovation&#44;<lb/> for all things new are so more to be condemned&#44; than the old<lb/> to be cast aside as obsolete.  Preaching has much that com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mends it to the respectful attention of a Congregation&#44; specially<lb/> so&#44; when the life of the teacher illustrates his instruction.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>But if we must recognize in the religious discourse an<lb/> absolute necessity demanded created by the present age changes of time&#44; we should<lb/> not suffer it to supplant the place ever held in the house of<lb/> our Lord by the venerable Ritual.  The right of the latter<lb/> to preeminence must not be disputed&#59; every encroachment<lb/> upon it to widen the sphere of ministerial preaching is&#44; in my<lb/> opinion&#44; a retrogression and not at all a progressive step.<lb/>  It is the sacrificing of a universal interest in Israel&#44; to the ad&#45;<lb/>&#45;vantage of a comparatively small minority.  Holding such con&#45;<lb/>&#45;victions&#44; I have never acted on the suggestion of <sic>yeilded</sic> to the pressure brought to bear on me for reducing the<lb/> established prayers&#44; in order to extend the boundaries of my speaking.<lb/>  And I am conformed in my ideas by the gratifying reflection that<lb/> even&#44; when I remain altogether silent&#44; as during the warmest<lb/> period of the season just closing&#44; many of my brethren worship<lb/> with me in the national language&#44; at evening time&#44; in the<lb/> morning&#44; and at noon &#91;Hebrew&#93;  May it always be<lb/> so&#33;  But the fervent wish of my heart cannot be fulfilled<lb/> without the combined efforts of my young coreligionists.<lb/></p>
            <p>We&#44; my friends&#33; that have run more than half the course<lb/> of human existence here below&#44; must begin to seek for those<lb/> who will supply our places.  A veritable satisfaction<lb/> will it be&#44; to discover that when we are gathered to our fathers&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>the offering of the lips will still be brought unto this house&#44;<lb/> by our successors.  With that object steadily in view&#44; we must<lb/> have our children early taught how to pray and understandingly<lb/> to join in public devotions.  I would&#44; however&#44; be remiss<lb/> in duty&#44; were I not to point out an error in which many<lb/> of our brethren fall&#44; notwithstanding their best intentions&#44; respecting<lb/> the permanence of the Jewish worship.  They train their<lb/> sons carefully for the performance of one ceremony at the Syna&#45;<lb/>&#45;gogue&#44; and trust to chance for the discharge of all other prac&#45;<lb/>&#45;tices.  The effect of that misapprehension is perceptible<lb/> in the usual absence of our youths from this hallowed spot&#44; shortly after their having reached their religious majority.<lb/>  They find themselves incapable of raising their voices to sing<lb/> the praises of the Lord in unison of with their elders.  The utterances<lb/> of the Reader at the sacred desk are unintelligible to them&#44; and<lb/> as soon as scarcely has the occasion on which they stood before it has passed&#44;<lb/> than all interest in the worship is lost.  I verily believe<lb/> that an acquaintance with the rudiments of the Hebrew<lb/> might be gained&#44; during the time devoted to the study of<lb/> a portion of the Law&#44; and that would eventually prove of more<lb/></p>

            <p>benefit to the student&#44; and would redound more<lb/> to the national interest&#44; than the memorising of a single<lb/> chapter from the Pentateuch.  I throw out a hint&#44; not with<lb/> the view to advocate a general discontinuance of a time&#45;honored<lb/> custom&#44; but to derive the greatest utility from the smallest<lb/> means.  They who commit their offspring to the charge of<lb/> a teacher in their young days&#44; so that preparing for the solemn<lb/> occasion of becoming Bar Mitzvah involves no extraordinary<lb/> effort&#44; have not any reason for acting upon my suggestion.  They<lb/> are fully alive to their obligation&#44; and their children&#39;s familiarity<lb/> with the Scriptures and the ritual will be reckoned righteousness<lb/> before the Lord.  But they who for motives not always under<lb/> their control&#44; do not follow a course so very descriable&#44; might<lb/> think of bestow a thought on what I have said intimated&#44; and possibly arrive at my conclusion.<lb/>  I have heard to&#45;day that Moses gave a notable command.<lb/>  Immediately after having crossed the Jordan&#44; the Rulers of<lb/> Israel should set up large stones&#44; and upon a cement pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;ared for the purpose&#44; engrave the principal laws.<lb/></p>
            <p>It will be pertinently asked.  Had not the legislator written<lb/> down the whole Law&#44; and put a copy thereof beside the<lb/> Ark of the Covenant&#63;  What necessity was there for tracing any part of it upon the stones&#63;  My friends&#33;  The answer<lb/></p>

            <p>to the query is the spirit of the ordinance itself.  Our great<lb/> teacher deemed the knowledge of the Torah so important that<lb/> every conceivable means by which it could be impressed deeply on the<lb/> mind was hailed by him and improved upon.  We&#44; his disciples&#44;<lb/> ought to be guided by that shining light in our endeavours to<lb/> hand down the ancestral religion.  A father in Israel&#44; should<lb/> study how he can make his son most2 contribute1 to the ac&#45;<lb/>&#45;complishing of a grand object&#45;&#45;the perpetuation of Judaism.<lb/>  He may discover that his powers do not equal his wishes in that<lb/> respect.  What he cannot do fully&#44; let him the discharge partially but to the best of his abilities.<lb/>  He will&#44; at all events&#44; readily perceive that an acquaintance<lb/> with a single portion of Holy Writ is no appreciable coopera&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion to the maintenance of the Jewish worship.  He will there&#45;<lb/>&#45;fore yield the momentary gratification which the prominence given<lb/> once to his child at the Synagogue&#44; naturally affords&#44; for the<lb/> advancement of the national cause.  the days and months oc&#45;<lb/>&#45;cupied by his son in mastering a barren knowledge&#44; will be de&#45;<lb/>&#45;voted to the acquirement of a fruitful learning.  The reciting of the<lb/> benedictions at being called to the Law&#44; will&#44; without cause instance&#44; amply<lb/> suffice&#44; if the but student was made but to understand the letter and the spirit<lb/> thereof&#44; and he is stirred up thereby to further efforts&#44; which will secure<lb/> his attendance in the dwelling of prayer.<lb/></p>

            <p>My dear young brother&#33;  It would be ungracious in me to<lb/> utter a word of discouragement.  No&#58; my nature and my duty<lb/> incite me to praise any action which signifies adherence to<lb/> the olden law&#44; and I shall not censure when a religious inten&#45;<lb/>tion is purposed to be carried out.  The ceremony which attend<lb/> the becoming a Bar Mitzvah is in very deed full of<lb/> meaning.  You have told us by its performance that you<lb/> are an Israelite&#44; not because born of Jewish parents&#44; but<lb/> because you have assumed the observance of the Torah.<lb/>  Yet I will say&#44;&#45;&#45;for it behooves me so to speak&#45;&#45;&#44; that the<lb/> rehearsing of the portion&#44; in which you repeated for our in&#45;<lb/>&#45;struction the command of Moses I have alluded to&#44; is the very<lb/> least of your observances.  Be not beguiled by the thought&#44;<lb/> apt to be entertained at your age&#44; that you have met with re&#45;<lb/>&#45;markable success.  Aside from the tacit acknowledgment of<lb/> your being one of us&#44; what you have learnt is useless to<lb/> the cause for which we all must work.  We are in duty bound<lb/> to become familiar with our national language&#45;&#45;the Hebrew&#45;&#45;<lb/> in order to understand well what God demands of us&#44; as his<lb/> chosen race&#44; and in order to give everlasting perpetuity to our worship.<lb/></p>
