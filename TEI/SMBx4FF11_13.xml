            <p>C<lb/>
                O<lb/>
                P<lb/>
                Y<lb/></p>
                
            <p>To the President and Trustees of the Jewish Theological Seminary Association<lb/></p> 
            <p>Gentlemen<lb/></p>
            <p>On Monday&#45;&#45;June 25th&#45;&#45;a private examination of the students<lb/> of our institution was held in Room 31 of Cooper Union.<lb/></p>
            <p>Of the ten pupils in the preparatory class only seven were present.<lb/>  I learned with regret that Isidor Cohen had been so irregular as to warrant his being<lb/> stricken from the roll&#59; that Solomon Bernstein is nearly as irregular&#44; and Raymond<lb/> Rubenstein&#45;&#45;though not so much at fault in his attendance&#45;&#45;behaves badly.<lb/></p>
            <p>The examination was conducted principally by myself in<lb/> conjunction with Dr. Kohut.  Emanuel and Joseph Hertz gave evidence of diligent<lb/> application to their studies&#44; and of natural capacities to retain what is taught<lb/> them.  They stood the highest in their average in all branches&#44; viz&#59; in 20 chapter<lb/> of Genesis with Rashi&#59; 50 psalms&#44; history from Joshua to the death of David&#59; grammar&#44;<lb/> Mishnah <hi rend="underline">Shabbath</hi> from chapter 9 to 11&#44; and Talmud <hi rend="underline">Baba Metzia</hi> p 8 to 11.<lb/></p>
            <p>David Wittenberg might rank with the two brothers aforenamed&#44;<lb/> were it not that he cannot express his thoughts intelligibly&#44; owing to his<lb/> imperfect acquaintance with English.  Elias Barowsky may be placed next as regard<lb/> history&#44; Mishnah and Ghemara&#44; and Bernard Blankford stands somewhat below.  The<lb/> latter has a pleasing appearance&#44; but evidently his looks betrayed excitement when<lb/> he was under examination.  Meyer Levy and Arnold Greenfield were found less<lb/> proficient than the rest.<lb/></p>
            <p>I can never too strongly recommend the enforcing of<lb/> Grammatical rules and diacritical marks in the reading of the Hebrew&#44; and I would<lb/> even suggest that whole chapters and psalms be memorized and recited distinctly<lb/> aloud&#44; so as to render the pupils familiar with the original&#44; and qualify them to<lb/> readily and correctly quote the sacred text.<lb/></p>
            <p>In the Junior class&#44; Levias&#44; Frohmsen and Iron are equal<lb/> respecting 16 chapters of Exodus with comments&#44; Hebrew Grammar and 8 p Ghemara<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Chullin</hi> and 10 of <hi rend="underline">Berachoth</hi>&#44; but not equal respecting their capacity of expression.<lb/>  I was pleased to notice an improvement in every sense in Simpson&#44; remembering how<lb/> unattractive his appearance and his address were when he was admitted into the<lb/> Seminary.  Friedlander did not average as high as his fellow&#45;students&#44; but he<lb/> seems anxious to rise up to the same standard.  Spicker&#44; or Speaker&#44; has often<lb/> applied to me and begged that he may be enrolled among our pupils.  He attends<lb/> merely as a listener.  Clearly&#44; he has a good knowledge of Talmud and&#44; I might<lb/> add also&#44; of Bible&#44; but his English is very bad&#44; and his appearance is not<lb/> prepossessing.  He may&#44; possibly&#44; be of service hereafter as a teacher.  I doubt his<lb/> ability to use the pulpit with credit to himself and with benefit to Judaism in<lb/> America.  I met for the first time at the private examination Halper.  He is a<lb/> young Talmudist&#44; needing a better acquaintance with other branches of our literature&#44;<lb/> and with our vernacular language.  I believe he simply attends as a listener.<lb/></p>
            <p>Drs. Drachman and Lieberman devote themselves with zeal to<lb/> the <sic>fulfilments</sic> of their task&#44; but it is natural to all who are engaged in<lb/> the performance of so responsible an undertaking as theirs&#44; to feel encouraged by<lb/> the occasional visits of Directors and Trustees at the sessions.  I crave for that<lb/></p>

            <p>encouragement at the hands of all who have united with me<lb/> towards the promotion of a holy cause.<lb/>
                Yours faithfully<lb/>
