            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Israelites&#33;  We have gathered round the coffin of a man&#44; who en&#45;<lb/>&#45;joyed abundant happiness.  You look incredulous&#44; and shake your<lb/> heads&#44; as if by speaking so I showed betrayed ignorance of human nature.<lb/>  &#34;None is happy&#44;&#34; you say to yourselves.  Those who possess ample means<lb/> enabling them to <sic>abdicat</sic> ease&#44; allow their imaginations to create occasions<lb/> for discontent&#59; others&#44; who might feel satisfied in a lowly condition&#44; free<lb/> from enslaving fashion&#44; suffer constant misery by fancying that they<lb/> are in want deprived of the only source of joy&#45;&#45;wealth.&#34;  Yes&#58; I know it&#44; my<lb/> friends&#33;  I know full well that man follows a shadow&#44; that is a<lb/> fictitious happiness&#44; that the creatures of the earth live in agitation<lb/> about vain objects.  For&#44; so experience shows&#44; and so am I likewise<lb/> told by the Scriptures &#91;Hebrew&#93;  Possibly&#44; our<lb/> brother who has left this world&#44; may&#44; during the early days of his<lb/> active life&#44; have shared the weakness common to mortals.  He<lb/> may have kept disquieted his mind disquieted in craving for the perishable<lb/> goods of the earth.  But if so&#58; if he had perchance been equal to many in the<lb/> errors of youth&#44; he certainly proved himself superior to myriads in his<lb/> declining years.  It is during them that I formed his acquaint&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance&#44; and I may assert&#44; without fear of contradiction&#44; that<lb/> Barrow D&#39;Ancona never showed signs of a refining spirit and of discontent&#44;<lb/> because of the station occupied.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Descending from a family highly respectable&#44; fitted<lb/> by education and habits to appreciate a choicer mode of living&#44;<lb/> he nevertheless moved humbly along&#44; suiting himself to the<lb/> changes of fortune&#44; setting always before his household an<lb/> example of industry&#44; of unimpeachable honesty&#44; and withal<lb/> of contentment.  It is therefore becoming in me&#44;<lb/> as it is due to his memory&#44; that I shall point out the means<lb/> by which my deceased friend gained a true nobility of character.<lb/>  Those means&#44; O fellow Israelites&#33; are such as Judaism places<lb/> within reach of all its adherents.  A soothing conviction that<lb/> no wrong can flow from the fountain of justice &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> an exalting belief that it is pleasing to the Almighty to see His<lb/> creatures trustingly bow to His unsearchable will.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Thus was my friend armed against the strokes of adversity&#44; thus<lb/> he bravely withstood the sore trials of domestic and business nature which<lb/> he had to undergo.  Like one who&#44; when the storm rages<lb/> without&#44; seeks shelter within a stronghold&#44; so did our lamented<lb/> brother look for and find refuge in acts of devotion and mercy.<lb/>  To the members of the Congregation Mikv&#232; Israel&#44; I need not<lb/> speak of his fond attachment to the house of God&#59; of<lb/> the intense satisfaction it afforded him to be privileged to read<lb/> a portion of the Prophets&#44; or of the ritual.  But I may<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>assure every brother within hearing of my voice&#44; that<lb/> the love which the all&#45;souled Jew bore the religion of his fathers&#44;<lb/> was deeply rooted&#44; that it revealed itself in the actions he<lb/> performed&#44; in the words he uttered.  More to promote a<lb/> holy cause than for the slight compensation received&#44; he would<lb/> devote his time to teaching.  I often witnessed the gratification pictured<lb/> on his countenance&#44; when he rated related how he had succeeded<lb/> in imparting the knowledge of the Hebrew prayers and the time&#45;<lb/>honored observances of our Creed.  His sole complaint was that he<lb/> could not always succeed as well in drawing to the Synagogue<lb/> those whom he taught.  But his zeal never abated&#44; and his he entertained<lb/> a glowing hope was to see a revival of the ordinances of the Lord&#44;<lb/> when his fellow&#45;believers would be no longer nominal Jews&#44; but<lb/> practical and staunch Israelites.  That hope joint with his<lb/> goodly efforts&#59; with deeds of social kindness&#59; acts of considerate and unostenta&#45;<lb/>&#45;tious benevolence&#44; and the consciousness of an irreproachable con&#45;<lb/>&#45;duct made him happy far happier than many who<lb/> are so cons judged regarded by the worldly&#44; notwithstanding that they have rained heaps<lb/> of gold upon the ruins of their moral characters&#44; and the<lb/> destruction of their religious principles.<lb/></p> 
            <p>When I recollect how this good Jew in his 80th year&#44; could<lb/> neither be induced by the gentle remonstrances of those near to him&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>nor by the well&#45;meant advice of friends to yeild <sic>forego</sic> a practice of his<lb/> faith&#44; which might prove injurious to his health&#44; how on Thursday<lb/> last he would abstain during 25 hours from any food in<lb/> memory of our national dispersion&#44; when I recall the joy he<lb/> evinced for having discharged what he deemed an obligation&#44; I<lb/> am compelled to exclaim &#34;May my latter end be like his&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> For as a reward to his piety&#44; must have his end have been so peaceful.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The wife he cherished&#44; and long<lb/> sustained in her declining decaying health&#44; the children for whom he<lb/> spared no pains&#44; and in whose increasing welfare he greatly rejoiced&#44;<lb/> the grand&#45;children and relatives after whom he yearned&#44; may be comforted<lb/> in the assurance that Barrow D&#39;Ancona died the death of the righteous&#44;<lb/> calm and smiling.  It was so that Aaron and Moses were gathered<lb/> to their fathers&#44; suffering none of the agonies&#44; accompanying the sepa&#45;<lb/>&#45;ration of the immortal from the mortal.  To you&#44; my surviving friends&#33;<lb/> the thought is harrowing.  We Hebrews generally deprecate so sudden a departure&#59;<lb/> but if it is to be lamented in him whom the Divine Messenger finds engros&#45;<lb/>&#45;sed in worldly affairs&#44; if&#44; as children&#44; we would prefer to bestow a<lb/> last token of reverence on the author of our existence&#44; the quick transition<lb/> may spare us nevertheless grief and anguish&#44; and it is more desired by him<lb/> who is at all times prepared to meet his God.  Such was your father &#38;c.<lb/></p>
