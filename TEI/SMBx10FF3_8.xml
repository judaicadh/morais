            <p>A lecture for the Sabbath<lb/>

            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  In the book which Israel are wont to read<lb/> this evening and on the morrow&#44; the following passage is<lb/> written&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Yet&#44; all this availeth me nothing&#44; so long as<lb/> I see Mordecai the Jew&#44; sitting at the kings&#39; gate.&#34;  You<lb/> have already recognized the speaker.  It is Haman addressing<lb/> his wife and friends on his return from the royal banquet<lb/> of which he had been the exclusive participant.  But&#44; can<lb/> it be really thus&#63;  Haman the father of a numerous<lb/> and influential family&#59; Haman the favorite of a mighty<lb/> king&#44; Haman the arbiter of a people&#39;s fate&#44; Haman the<lb/> powerful&#44; the honored and the wealthy&#44; Haman the special<lb/> guest of an Eastern queen&#44; considered all as of no value&#44;<lb/> because one man refused him obeisance&#63;  Aye&#58; but that<lb/> man was a Jew.  The same offense committed by another<lb/> might have been overlooked.  Self&#45;respect might have<lb/> suggested an assumed indifference&#44; but a Jew had been<lb/> guilty thereof.  Not to heed it&#44; would be derogatory<lb/> to one&#39;s dignity.  It would be sinking from the high<lb/> position occupied&#59; for&#44; hatred against a Jew needs<lb/> not be suppressed.  It is a virtue.  Revenge may be<lb/></p>

            <p>openly wreaked upon his head.  Do you ask&#44; why&#63;<lb/>  Because&#44; answers an ancient Rabbi &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;whosoever undertakes to injure Israel&#44; is chosen<lb/> a chief.&#34;  So many will applaud&#44; so many will urge him<lb/> on&#44; that he will be proclaimed a hero&#44; and not a<lb/> tyrant.  For&#44; the sufferings of our people&#44; appears<lb/> to excite to no sympathy.  Observe&#44; my beloved hearers&#33;<lb/>  The edict issued by Haman spared neither sex nor<lb/> age.  In one day every one bearing the name of Jew&#44;<lb/> was doomed to be thrust by the sword.  And the more<lb/> to inflame the passions&#44; a rich booty was promised as<lb/> a reward for the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of that murderous decree.<lb/>  But though&#45;&#45;judging from historical accounts&#45;&#45;the<lb/> mandate must have reached every province long before<lb/> its contemplated execution&#59; not a voice was raised to<lb/> deprecate the evil or to pity.  The innocent shall<lb/> fall victims to the cupidity of a loose populace&#44; but<lb/> those who do not encourage the slaughter&#44; will look<lb/> on unmoved and unconcerned.  They who perish<lb/> are only Jews.  &#34;But hath not a Jew eyes&#63;  Hath<lb/> not a Jew hands&#63; organs&#44; dimensions&#44; senses&#44; affections.&#34;<sic>&#63;</sic><lb/>  Does he not feel a wrong&#44; or is he not sensible of a favor&#63;<lb/></p>

Coercion<lb/> will be equally fruitless.  The Jews will postpone<lb/> to their prescriptions&#44; all royal enactments.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  It cannot be unjust therefore to visit upon<lb/> a whole nation&#44; so inflexible&#44; and so tenacious of their<lb/> singular rules&#44; the son of one individual  Such was<lb/> the reasoning of the detestable Haman&#44; and such have<lb/> been the arguments adduced at all times by those&#44; whose<lb/> joy it was&#44; to embitter our existence&#44; O my Brethren&#33;..<lb/>  The heathens persecuted us&#44; because we could not&#44; con&#45;<lb/>&#45;cientiously&#44; pay to mortal beings&#44; the homage due<lb/> solely unto God.

Jewish industry and thrift have asserted<lb/> their influence in the commercial world.  Hence&#44; where<lb/> the spoiler cannot rudely seize our substance&#44; the<lb/> lowest passion are appealed to&#44; in order to injure our<lb/> standing.  Now&#44; it is a powerful chieftain&#44; who&#44; not<lb/> unlike Haman&#44; issues an edict that he will grant<lb/> no Jew access to his camp&#44; or a home in his military<lb/> district&#59; for&#44; &#34;the Hebrews are mischievous.&#34;  Anon&#44; it is<lb/> a fanatic&#44; to whom may fitly be applied the saying<lb/> of our Teachers about Pharaoh&#39;s butler &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;A good service proferred by the wicked&#44; will<lb/> be always  mixed with alloy&#34;. for&#44; he also in his<lb/> misdirected &#38; mistaken zeal&#44; holds up the Jew to contempt.  &#34;The<lb/> Hebrews are covetous.&#34;  Then again is the prejudice&#44;<lb/> unhappily fostered against us by a great genius&#44;<lb/> striven to be revived through means&#44; the more offensive&#44;<lb/> because utterly inappropriate.

            <p>give vent to his feelings of envy and malice.  he also cries &#34;the Hebrews<lb/> are usurious.&#34;  And those whose frowning looks<lb/> should have made the offender shrink to his little measure&#44;<lb/> approve and reward his act.  Brethren&#33;  On the day<lb/> that the custodians of human rights stood up for the<lb/> <sic>defence</sic> of iniquity&#44; a funeral pall was thrown over<lb/> your franchises.  Then I did exclaim in my despair.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;They are shepherds that will not understand&#59; they all look<lb/> to their way&#44; every one for his gain&#44; from his own quarter.&#34;<lb/>  Confide not your people&#39;s honor into their hands.  Hope<lb/> not to obtain from them vindication and justice.<lb/>  For&#44; you they also have made a league against Israel.<lb/>  You are the target of every archer&#59; the butt of all<lb/> poisoned arrows.  Fly to the Rock of all ages&#44; up<lb/> to the God of your salvation.  The self&#45;styled<lb/> liberal may deceive&#44; the intolerant and the curious may<lb/> devise altogether our ruin&#44; but &#34;the Lord is just.  he cut&#45;<lb/>&#45;teth asunder the cords of the wicked&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Haman imagined he could have easily destroyed<lb/> the life of Mordecai&#44; but a dreaded King suddenly<lb/></p>

            <p>came to his rescue.  Haman looked forward exultingly<lb/> to the thirteenth day of Adar&#44; that the objects of<lb/> his hatred be consumed&#59; but Esther had been Divinely<lb/> chosen to extinguish the spark&#44; ready to kindle<lb/> an all&#45;devouring fire.  He &#34;who is not a man<lb/> that lieth&#44; nor a son of man that repenteth&#34; has<lb/> declared that no weapon forged against us shall<lb/> ever prosper&#59; but let us remember&#44; my friends&#33; that<lb/> the promise is not unconditional.  It is only the<lb/> reward of those who serve the Lord with singleness of<lb/> purpose&#44; of those who cling to righteousness.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But if we depart from<lb/> the way of God&#59; if we profane His name by a<lb/> conduct unbecoming responsible beings&#59; if we care<lb/> more for an ill&#45;gotten coin&#44; than for the honor of<lb/> Israel and the glory of our Celestial Protector&#44; we shall<lb/> deservedly be the reproach of our neighbors.  Oh&#33; my<lb/> Brethren&#33; how poignant the sorrow I feel&#44; when the<lb/> name I most wish to be respected&#44; is recorded among<lb/> those of men that trespass against society.  Could<lb/> I wash off the stain with my heart&#39;s blood&#44; I<lb/> would gladly shed it.  For&#44; no wound is so deep<lb/></p>

            <p>as that occasioned by the injustice that visits upon<lb/> a whole nation the crime of a few individuals.<lb/>  But it has been so inscrutably decreed&#44; and we must<lb/> bow to the fiat.  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Israel is a stray<lb/> sheep&#34;.  Wherefore has Jeremiah likened us to that<lb/> animal&#63; inquire our Sages.  &#34;Because&#44;&#34; is the reply&#44;<lb/> &#34;as the sheep when struck in any part of its body&#44;<lb/> trembles in all its limbs&#44; so when a member of the<lb/> Jewish family sins&#44; the entire household is made to<lb/> suffer&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  It being literally<lb/> thus&#44; we ought to study every action&#44; to weigh every<lb/> expression&#44; we ought to avoid with infinite care&#44;<lb/> whatever the prejudiced may <sic>miscontrue</sic> or <sic>wilfully</sic><lb/> misrepresent to the discredit of our people.<lb/></p>
            <p>It is natural we should exert our energies to our temporal<lb/> advantage&#44; it is but right we should be left to form<lb/> our own ideas of current events&#44; and exercise our judgment<lb/> in matters we deem of vital importance&#44; but let<lb/> us&#44; I conjure you&#44; let us show in our public and private<lb/> conduct the honesty of our purpose.  Let us disarm the<lb/> opponents of Judaism&#44; by proving that its professors<lb/></p>

            <p>are men of truth&#59; too high&#45;minded to be guilty<lb/> of venal actions&#44; too noble spirited to procure by<lb/> subterfuge what they cannot gain legitimately&#59;<lb/> Too&#45;deeply imbued with a sense of justice&#44; to<lb/> profit by the sufferings of the community.<lb/></p>
                <p>The history we will recite this evening affords us a rare<lb/> instance of human uprightness.  Let us be instruct&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed thereby.  Our ancestors whom hatred had<lb/> delivered to the executioners and the plunderers&#44; might<lb/> have hailed with joy the hour that enabled them to<lb/> retaliate.  When royal authority empowered the<lb/> Jews to slay their adversaries&#44; and without pausing<lb/> to discriminate&#44; cut off the young with the old&#44;<lb/> and seize the spoil&#44; they might&#44; have s in turn&#44;<lb/> have steeled their hearts against pity.  As their<lb/> enemies have often cried&#44; so they also might have exclaimed<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Surely&#44; this is the day<lb/> we have waited for&#44; we have found it&#59; we have seen<lb/> it&#34;.  But no&#58; forced to kill in self&#45;<sic>defence</sic>&#44;<lb/> they would not imbrue their hands in innocent blood.<lb/></p>

            <p>Women and children continued unhurt.  Men&#44; only<lb/> men among their assailants&#44; fell beneath the strokes<lb/> of their swords.  The number of the slain may<lb/> indeed seem prodigious&#44; but it will cease to appear<lb/> so&#44; when it is considered that the conflict was<lb/> carried on in one hundred and twenty seven states&#44;<lb/> and that the adherents of Haman exercised every<lb/> where much power and influence.  But the<lb/> humanity exhibited by our fathers&#44; was exceeded<lb/> by their integrity.  The impartial narrative<lb/> thrice records that Israel&#39;s malignant foes were<lb/> left in the full enjoyment of their wealth &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  A prejudiced would assert that<lb/> avarice is our national characteristic&#44; but the in&#45;<lb/>&#45;cident alluded to in the book of Esther proves the<lb/> accusation groundless and false.  Were we disposed to<lb/> recriminate&#44; we might with facility show that our<lb/> traducers are black with the spots which they unblushingly<lb/> declare to have detected in us&#44; but we should disdain&#44;<lb/> my dear Brethren&#33; to thus seek our vindication.<lb/>  Let us not look downward&#44; but upward.  The demeanour<lb/> of those noble beings&#44; whose deed brightly illustrated<lb/></p>

            <p>illustrate the principles of Judaism&#44; must be our<lb/> <sic>defence</sic>; that will demonstrate the what rules are those by which we<lb/> are guided.  An Israelite that has stooped low for<lb/> the sake of lucre&#44; is but a decayed branch of our<lb/> national tree.  An Israelite who has sacrificed the<lb/> instincts of his nature&#44; and the ancestral teaching<lb/> to a position&#44; or a title&#44; is a venomous root in the<lb/> vineyard of the Lord of hosts.  Honesty&#44; humanity<lb/> and charity&#59; they are the command required of a Jew<lb/> to be performed towards all men.  The practice of those virtues<lb/> in all our relations of life&#44; will be our advocate at<lb/> the bar of mankind.  That will cover our detractors with<lb/> confusion&#44; that&#44; and only that will ultimately gain for us<lb/> the name and the rank due to the chosen people of God.<lb/>  Beloved hearers&#33;  Let us hold fast thereon.<lb/></p>
                <p>And Thou O everlasting Lord&#44; who didst thwart the<lb/> evil devices of Haman&#44; be now also with us.  Suffer<lb/> not the ill&#45;disposed to soil our fame and distress our<lb/> hearts.  Grant that we may find here the peace<lb/> we value&#44; and the <sic>tranquillity</sic> we deserve.  Incline<lb/> the minds of all favorably toward us&#44; and<lb/></p>
