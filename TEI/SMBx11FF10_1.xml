            <p>Funeral Oration<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  Eleven years have very nigh expired&#44; since I was<lb/> unworthily chosen to officiate on the ministry of our holy religion.<lb/>  During that period&#44; it has been my painful duty frequently<lb/> to perform the burial service&#45;&#45;sometimes even on those near and dear to my heart&#45;&#45;but only once did my feelings and<lb/> judgment prompt me to deliver a funeral oration.  It was<lb/> at the demise of one&#44; whose memory I still hold in vene&#45;<lb/>&#45;ration.  It was when the mortal remains of the righteous<lb/> Esther Cohen Hart&#44; were about to be consigned to mother earth.<lb/>  On that occasion I could literally follow the counsel of<lb/> the ancients&#44; without swerving in aught from absolute<lb/> truth&#59; for&#44; only good could be spoken of that loveable<lb/> woman.  But the emotions which urged me then<lb/> to speak&#44; have this day again been fully aroused.<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  It is not to listen to a panegyric on the virtues<lb/> which adorned the character of my lamented late friend&#44; that I<lb/> have gathered you around his coffin&#44;&#45;&#45;for&#44; were I disposed to<lb/> pronounce it&#44; the recollection of his retiring modesty&#44; would<lb/> bid me forbear&#45;&#45;but I have summoned you solely to join me in pouring forth<lb/> laments over the irreparable loss which our Community<lb/> has sustained &#91;Hebrew&#93;  In this speculative<lb/> age&#44; when honesty&#44; charity and piety are valued only so<lb/></p>

            <p>far as they do not conflict with material preferments&#44; we<lb/> may see&#44; but will find exceedingly few that can compare<lb/> with Judah L. Hackenburg.  Say&#44; my hearers&#33; does<lb/> this age of calculating skepticism&#44; offer many instances<lb/> of individuals&#44; who&#44; alike in affluence&#44; as in straitened circum&#45;<lb/>&#45;stances&#44; follow the standard of the law of Sinai&#44; holding<lb/> incessantly in their hands &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Just balances&#44;<lb/> a just Epha and a just Hin&#34;&#63;  Or&#44; is the mind<lb/> often permitted in our days to behold the exemplification<lb/> of that virtue recommended by the inspired Psalmist &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Withhold thy tongue from uttering evil&#63;&#34; to bear witness to the<lb/> suavity of a temperament&#44; which finds discovers in man much to praise<lb/> and which is scrupulously chary to condemn&#63;  Or&#44; Is the worship<lb/> due to the God of our fathers&#45;&#45;so humanizing and so ennobling<lb/> of our nature&#45;&#45;universally tendered by the recipients of the Torah&#63;<lb/>  do we see throngs &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; assiduously watching at the<lb/> portals of the house of prayer&#63;.....  Alas&#33; when we<lb/> contemplate the apathy so rife touching every thing which<lb/> is good true and holy&#44; and the insatiable longing after the fleeting<lb/> goods of the earth&#44; our sorrow for the decease of our estimable<lb/> friend&#44; is greatly deepened.  For&#44; know ye that the heart<lb/> which has ceased to vilerate&#44; throbbed with unabated love<lb/></p>

            <p>for God and his sacred behests.  Yes&#44; Judah L. Hacken&#45;<lb/>&#45;burg might have bequeathed his offspring considerable wealth&#44;<lb/> but he preferred leaving to them the example of an incorruptible<lb/> life.  He would and did show them through all the walks<lb/> of life that the principles of Justice&#44; of humanity&#44; and of out&#45;<lb/>ward as of inward ceremonial religion must be postponed to no interested motives&#44;<lb/> to no expediency.  He would demonstrate to them by deeds as<lb/> well as by precepts&#44; that to fear God&#44; and keep his commands&#44;<lb/> is man&#39;s mission upon earth&#44; and not to garner pelf &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Oh&#33; may they copy so noble a<lb/> pattern&#33;  The reverence they owe to the memory of a<lb/> father&#44; who was ever solicitous for their real happiness&#44; will<lb/> be best evinced by a steadfast adherence to his last injunction.<lb/>  Thus did that godly man write&#44; when he felt that his<lb/> terrestrial end was fast approaching.  &#34;My children cling to<lb/> your faith religion&#44; keep the Sabbath&#45;day&#34; and ere his hand was<lb/> paralyzed in death&#44; it patriarchally rested on the heads of<lb/> those he fondly cherished&#44; while his righteous lips pronounced<lb/> upon them the threefold priestly blessing.  Serene was<lb/> his departure from the world&#44; as his dwelling therein had been<lb/> marked by a gentle and peaceful demeanour.  Confident<lb/> in the mercy of his Creator&#44; whom he had faithfully served&#59;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>firm in the belief of a hereafter&#44; of whose everlasting<lb/> durability&#44; his enlightened mind had long been convinced&#44;<lb/> he rejoiced to appear into the presence of Him &#34;who causeth<lb/> to die&#44; but who reviveth&#44; who bringeth down to the grave&#44;<lb/> but also bringeth up again&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Spirit of my departed friend&#33;  From the heavenly habitation where<lb/> thou art glorying in the reward of thy manifold virtues&#44; look down<lb/> upon the beloved ones&#44; who mourn and weep.  Watch over their<lb/> future steps&#44; let the memory of thee thy sterling worth be their shield against<lb/> the allurements of a corrupt world&#44; let them be it stirred them to<lb/> the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of thy paternal wish&#44; and that they may be Israelites without<lb/> guile and without deceit.  And on behalf of One who has<lb/> frequently prayed with2 thee and for1 thee&#44; implore Almighty<lb/> God&#44; that peace and unalloyed joy be vouchsafed to him<lb/> for evermore.  Amen.<lb/></p>
