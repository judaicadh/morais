            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Happy is he every one that feareth the Lord&#44; that walketh in his ways.&#34;<lb/>  So begins one of those fifteen charming psalms&#44; which the<lb/> Scriptural writer called &#34;Songs of degrees.&#34;  It might be reason&#45;<lb/>&#45;ably supposed that the introductory sentence opens to our<lb/> mental views a picture of duties immediately connected with the exer&#45;<lb/>&#45;cise of Justice and mercy.  On reading that preface we<lb/> might expect an urgent exhortation to follow the Biblical precepts<lb/> and adhere to piety.  But instead of such admonitions&#44; we<lb/> hear this&#58; &#34;When thou shalt eat of the labor of thy hands&#44; thou<lb/> shalt be happy and it will be well with thee.&#34;  Does the<lb/> psalmist then consider handicraft the effective means to draw<lb/> the creature to his Creator as to an inseparable associate&#63;  Does<lb/> he regard manual labor a stream whence Divine favors flow&#63;<lb/>  Precisely so&#44; and the Sages understood him in that sense&#44;<lb/> when they added to the passage just quoted&#44; sentence&#44; the assurance that<lb/> the blessings promised by the inspired author&#44; would be felt<lb/> here and likewise hereafter&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93; Happy shalt thou be in<lb/> this world&#44; and happy in the world to come.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>This is not the occasion to show the high value which<lb/> Holy Writ and its Talmudic expositors place on manual labor&#44;<lb/> else I could by citations bring the conviction home to every mind&#44; that<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>industry is adorned by Judaism with the insignia<lb/> of unfading nobility.  But having been asked to<lb/> perform the funeral rites over the mortal remains of an Israelite&#44;<lb/> whose career strikingly illustrated the teaching of our<lb/> psalmist&#44; I have deemed it fit to explain why he ought<lb/> to be carried to his grave amidst the solemnity of prayers&#44;<lb/> and why he is entitled to an honorable mention among the<lb/> community of his people.  I do not know<lb/> whether my venerable brother in faith was conversant with<lb/> the maxims of the Rabbis&#44; but in listening to an account<lb/> of his life work I was strongly reminded of one of our olden<lb/> preceptors who with unsurpassing independence of mind<lb/> said&#58; &#40;If there be in &#91;&#63;&#93;&#41; &#34;Strip a carcass in a thoroughfare and live on the wages<lb/> made&#44; and do not refuse the office as too menial&#44; because<lb/> thou art a priest&#44; or art considered looked upon as a great man.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Leopold Levy had enjoyed a competence in his native land&#44;<lb/> and lost it by untoward circumstances.  Many a man<lb/> is unmanned when cast down from a certain height by a<lb/> stroke of misfortune.  He will then drag an existence of unambi&#45;<lb/>&#45;tious lowliness.  The energy with which nature has endowed<lb/> him sinks into sloth&#59; his former activity is recovered<lb/> no more.  Not so was it with our deceased coreligionist.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Doubtless&#44; his heart misgave him&#44; when the Crimean<lb/> war entailed upon his household poverty&#44; but he did not long<lb/> remain in a state of dejection.  If a voluntary exile<lb/> must be his lot&#44; inertness shall not accompany him<lb/> to a foreign country.  Leopold Levy believed with the<lb/> psalmist in the powerful efficacy of handicraft&#44; and<lb/> the teaching lesson of the Sages that by its agency we may<lb/> win lasting felicity&#44; became his polar star.  Did he<lb/> reach the haven of his desires&#63;  Ask it of his six children&#44;<lb/> who love industry and pride themselves in the paternal ex<lb/>&#45;ample.  They mirror forth the spirit of self reliance<lb/> whereby which their further overcame impediments at which<lb/> others less manly would have stood in awe and started<lb/> back.  From his offspring you will learn that the<lb/> departed&#44; while treading this nether path&#44; continued undaunted&#44;<lb/> and when the irrevocable message came&#44; it found him in a<lb/> state of ease&#44; satisfied with the endeavours that had <sic>yeilded</sic><lb/> him upon earth abundant comforts&#44; and given a promise<lb/> that it would be well with him also in another a field of spiri&#45;<lb/>&#45;tual labors &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Naturally&#44; his sons and daughters had<lb/> formed plans&#44; whose execution would have afforded them filial<lb/> delight.  Their parents should spend a far advanced age patriarchally<lb/></p> 
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>in the enjoyment of the fruits of their own<lb/> planting&#44; when they set deep into the hearts of their<lb/> progeny the germs of d industry.  But As Sovereign<lb/> wisdom decreed otherwise and to it they reverently bow.<lb/>  They lament the failure of their designs&#44; but they are content be&#45;<lb/>&#45;cause the tears shed when their mother was summoned hence&#44; and<lb/> those now drawn at the thought of a terrestrial separation with from<lb/> their father&#44; are not mingled with remorse&#44; but blended with<lb/> the memories joyous&#44; sweet and soul elevating.  The child&#45;<lb/>&#45;ren of Leopold Levy realize that if the religion of<lb/> Israel does demand sacrifices of every one who feareth the<lb/> Lord&#44; and walketh in His ways&#44;&#34; it still encourages hu&#45;<lb/>&#45;man independence&#44; it upholds human dignity&#44; and declares<lb/> him blessed everlastingly who uses well the physical and<lb/> intellectual faculties wherewith which the Creator of nature<lb/> has abundantly granted.
