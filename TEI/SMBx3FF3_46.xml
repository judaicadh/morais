                My dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I have your favor of<lb/> the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of last month.  Only this evening I could man<lb/>age to attend to my correspondence&#44; which&#44; for the last<lb/> three weeks had been sadly neglected.  I am&#44; in the lan<lb/>guage of an old Presbyterian friend of mine a &#34;muchly<lb/> worked&#34; man.  My literary engagements require almost<lb/> all my day&#45;hours&#44; and I was much as working for Jew<lb/>ish papers is like working &#91;Hebrew&#93; I do a little<lb/> extra work for southern papers and magazines so as to<lb/> earn money for books&#44; of which I have now a considerable<lb/> number&#44; including the first four vols. of the new &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> which is a beauty.  In addition I prepare my sermons&#44;<lb/> read modern literature and study.  I have during the<lb/> past month studied Jesaja&#91;&#63;&#93; 48&#45;53 with critical notes<lb/> of my own composition&#59; read ten pages in &#91;Hebrew&#93;; also<lb/> in &#91;Hebrew&#93; the weekly chapters and found time<lb/> to <del>write</del> read Kayserling&#39;s Life of Mendelssohn&#44; Hensel&#39;s<lb/> &#34;Mendelssohn family&#34; and four chapters of the<lb/> eleventh volume of Graetz&#39; history of the Jews.<lb/>  The latter three works I needed for a course of<lb/></p>

            <p>Houston&#44; Texas&#44; _____188<lb/></p>
            <p>Friday evening lectures I am now delivering before my<lb/> congregation on the &#34;history of the Jews from 1750&#45;1880.&#34;<lb/>  The life of Mendelssohn formed the special theme<lb/> for the last four weeks.  Were it not for the &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/>ions of my professional calling&#44; I could write and<lb/> study more.  I will not travel this winter&#59; I need <hi rend="underline">all</hi><lb/> my time for my congregation and my own improvement.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have not yet received the volumes of the &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> but I enclose three dollars&#44; which I beg you to place<lb/> to my account for their eventual arrival I am<lb/> indeed anxious for a closer acquaintance with this<lb/> wonderful &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have been painfully surprised at Mr. Ben<lb/>jamin&#39;s inaugural.  I said &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> We live no longer in the age of hobbies&#59; we are in<lb/> the age of distinction and God only knows when the<lb/> building up will commence.  I begin more and more<lb/> to perceive the stupendous blender of rapid<lb/> transit theology and my change of opinion is<lb/> cognizable in the earnest&#44; moderate and conservative<lb/></p>

            <p>tone of the Visitor.<lb/></p>
            <p>I beg you to note the difference in dates between the<lb/> first and third pages of this letter.  At the close of the<lb/> second page I was interrupted whilst writing it&#44; and<lb/> until this minute found no time to finish it.  I mailed you<lb/> last week two copies of the Visitor and I will esteem it a<lb/> favor if you will give me your criticism upon its cont<lb/>ents.  Now&#44; dear Sir&#44; I come to you for advice &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  There is some trouble here&#44; of which the<lb/> main burden falls on my shoulders&#44; and I hardly know<lb/> which way to turn&#44; for the simple reason that the matter<lb/> is one of <hi rend="underline">policy</hi>&#44; not of &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The case is substant<lb/>ially as follows&#58; A man&#44; who for many years had<lb/> borne a good reputation&#44; became a criminal.  He<lb/> is a widower&#44; has two children&#44; a boy and girl.  In his<lb/> sister&#39;s house he seduced a servant girl&#44; a gentile&#44;<lb/> of dubious character&#44; and was&#44; upon her complaint&#44;<lb/> indited by the grand jury for seduction.  This crime<lb/> is punishable in this state with penitentiary<lb/> for no less than two and no more than ten years<lb/></p>

            <p>The man&#44; who is a member of my congregation&#44; became<lb/> alarmed&#44; and after the girl had given birth to a male<lb/> child&#44; he married her&#44; thus quashing the indictment<lb/> against him.  Then <hi rend="underline">my</hi> troubles commenced.  Three weeks<lb/> ago the new mistress&#44; made a wife by force of law<lb/> or fear of punishment&#44; presented herself to me with<lb/> the request to be made&#8212;a Jewess&#33;  I received her<lb/> kindly&#44; spoke of the difficulties connected with such<lb/> an act&#44; in short evaded an answer&#44; mainly to gain<lb/> time.  Let me say here&#44; that I am&#44; and have always<lb/> been&#44; bitterly opposed to proselytizing.  Especially<lb/> have I a horror of making a Jew or Jewess out of<lb/> such&#44; whose carnal inclinations simply bring them<lb/> to become yoke&#45;fellows of members of our race.<lb/>  Excepting once in Philadelphia&#44; when on the Board<lb/> of Ministers&#44; I never engaged in such work.  <hi rend="underline">Five</hi><lb/> applied to me in Texas&#44; and I invariably refused<lb/> them&#59; they went to other cities where&#44; for a fee&#44; the<lb/> minister converted and married them the<lb/> same hour.  Yet&#44; I am conscious that occasion<lb/></p>

            <p>may arise&#44; when such an act would be a wise poli<lb/>cy.  In the present case&#44; I have been thinking&#44; that<lb/> this woman&#44; though she was little less than a courtesan<lb/> &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;&#44; being now the legally married wife of a Hebrew&#44;<lb/> and having the care of two Jewish children&#44; who at<lb/>tend my Sabbath schools besides her own boy&#44; whom<lb/> his father has also been &#91;Hebrew&#93; upon the<lb/> mother promising that she would raise him as a<lb/> Jew&#44; I say&#44; I have been thinking that the act<lb/> of formally making her a Jewess might encourage<lb/> her to do a mother&#39;s duty by these children.  I have<lb/> thus expressed myself to the husband&#44; without at<lb/> all agreeing or promising or specifying a time<lb/> to do the act.  But now come the ladies of his<lb/> family&#44; sisters and sisters&#45;in&#45;law&#44; ladies of most<lb/> excellent standing in the community&#44; exemplary<lb/> Jewesses and faithful workers&#44; and just vow&#44; that<lb/> they will leave the congregation in case this wo<lb/>man enters our ranks.  They have sternly set their<lb/> face against their brother.  My prayers&#44; protestations<lb/></p>

The question now is&#58;<lb/> what is my duty&#63;  Shall I follow my judgement and<lb/> only for the purpose of saving these children&#44; make the<lb/> woman a Jewess&#44; or shall I suffer prejudice&#44; no matter<lb/> how well founded&#44; to interfere and refuse to accede<lb/> to the request&#63;  I cannot give myself an answer&#44; and<lb/> I look anxiously for advice from you.
