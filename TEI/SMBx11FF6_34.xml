            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>My friends&#33;  Possessing but a limited knowledge of the charac&#45;<lb/>&#45;ter of our deceased brother&#44; and having had scarcely sufficient<lb/> time to collect my thoughts&#44; it is natural that I should feel<lb/> great hesitancy to pronounce a funeral oration.  Should even<lb/> my expressions be faultless with regard to diction&#44; I might fail<lb/> to bestow adequate praise on virtue&#44; or&#44; on the other hand&#44; I might<lb/> utter aught which would be interpreted as adulation.  Yet&#44; I dare<lb/> not withhold my services&#44; when the performance thereof may<lb/> in any degree&#44; be of utility.  For&#44; after all&#44; my dear hearers&#63; the<lb/> dead cannot be affected by our commendation&#44; nor can our words of<lb/> disparagement influence their future happiness&#59; but the living&#44;<lb/> the living need our sympathy&#44; they need our comforting utterances&#44;<lb/> they must receive a friendly counsel&#44; and they should mainly<lb/> occupy the mind of the speaker on melancholy occasions like the<lb/> present.  Aye&#58; my bereaved friends&#33;  I comply with your request<lb/> simply to apply to your hearts a soothing balm&#44; and likewise to<lb/> urge that you will perpetuate among your descendants the<lb/> qualities which signi notably distinguished your predecessors.<lb/>  I verily believe that the love you bore this member of the<lb/> household of Asch&#44; and the tenderness with which you smoothed<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>his bed of sickness&#44; must be prove a source of lasting consola&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion&#44; a reflection on which you will hereafter dwell with much<lb/> satisfaction.  Could human agency have preserved the existence of<lb/> one who had already reached beyond its assigned limits&#44; your excer&#45;<lb/>&#45;tions would doubtless have been successful&#44; but it is written &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;No one hath power over the<lb/> spirit&#44; to retain the spirit.&#34;  The demise which does not<lb/> awaken feelings a sense of compunction for by reason of neglected duties&#44; should<lb/> be endured with serene calmness.  Our endeavours should principally<lb/> be directed to ease the passage that leads to the gates of death.  To do<lb/> more is above our strength.  Would indeed that many sons and<lb/> daughters could share the feelings which pervades your minds at<lb/> this hour.  How often&#44; alas&#33; the tears shed over the coffin of our<lb/> parents are drawn by biting remorse&#44; by the remembrance of that<lb/> which saddened the life of those whose declining age we should<lb/> have sustained and cheered.  For&#44; it is then that we become aware<lb/> of the enormity of our sin&#44; then we perceive how tardy are our<lb/> regrets.  Fain would we recall the past&#59; that word&#44; that<lb/> action that which harrowed the parental heart&#44; but in vain.  Our<lb/> unfilial conduct will rise like a spectre to terrify our thoughts.<lb/>  Our lamented brother never experienced the joys of paternity&#59;<lb/> but he had trustingly looked for tokens of affection to those<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/> 
            <p>with whom he was bound by the ties of nature.  His hopes<lb/> were fully realized.  That he was deserving of that reward&#44; I may<lb/> safely assert&#44; notwithstanding my unacquaintance with his general<lb/> habits.  For&#44; I know the school in which he had been reared.<lb/>  It taught piety.  It taught the necessity of frequently communing<lb/> with our heavenly Maker&#59; and none exceeded Aaron Asch in<lb/> the performance of that sacred obligation.  He would never suffer<lb/> worldly concerns to cause the <sic>postponment</sic> of his devotional exercises.<lb/>  And often could his bent form be seen wending towards the house of God.<lb/>  Others may have sought recreation in blending with fashionable circles.<lb/>  His delight&#44; his solace was his prayer book.  Withhold your<lb/> those derisive smiles ye who deem such a conduct unsocial.<lb/>  For if its is true that Judaism does not prevent its votaries from mingling<lb/> with the mirthful&#44; it cannot nevertheless be denied that the<lb/> tendency of the age is for casting aside the communion of the herd&#44;<lb/> to run headlong after wanton diversions.  Far better it is to<lb/> lean to an extreme which upholds us in virtu righteousness&#44;<lb/> than to venture on a path which conducts to a maze of vice<lb/> and immorality.  Pleasure is not incompatible with piety&#44; but<lb/> when the former threatens to sap the latter&#44; the avoiding of<lb/> every object which may become an enticement&#44; should be highly<lb/> commended.  Therefore do I offer the character of my<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>lamented brother as an example.  And judging from report&#44;<lb/> I may consider him worthy of imitation for other motives besides<lb/> that to which I have just referred.  I learn that the unosten&#45;<lb/>&#45;tatious manner in which he fulfilled his religious devotions&#44; he carried<lb/> out also in doing acts of beneficence.  Adhering to the Rabbinical<lb/> instruction that secret charity is most valued&#44; he succoured his needy<lb/> fellow&#45;men&#44; spurning the thought of having his name embla&#45;<lb/>&#45;zoned on the pages which record the gifts of the rich.<lb/></p>
            <p>Happily thou&#44; my brother&#33; happy thou.  Death has no terror for such<lb/> one as thou wert.  In close contact during thy terrestrial pil&#45;<lb/>&#45;grimage with the spirit which pervades the universe&#44; thou art<lb/> now borne on the wings of prayer to those regions where thy<lb/> soul will become identified with celestial intelligences.  Rest<lb/> in peace.  Enjoy the contemplation of the sun of righteousness<lb/> while a embosomed in eternity.  And let the memory<lb/> of the virtues thou didst perform on earth be a comfort to thy<lb/> surviving relatives&#44; and a further incentive to the execution<lb/> of goodly and laudable acts.<lb/></p>
