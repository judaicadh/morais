            <p>Cincinnati Aug. 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1878.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev S. Morais<lb/>
                My dear sir.<lb/></p>
            <p>Your last favour was<lb/> duly recd. was pleased to learn all were<lb/> well with you.  With us only tolerable<lb/> dear Esther does not enjoy good health<lb/> by no means.  I have considerable head<lb/> ache to day.  Mrs E. is at Richmond&#44;<lb/> enjoying herself with our family there&#44;<lb/> I note your remarks about our<lb/> Union and College affairs with much in&#45;<lb/>terest&#44; and regret very much that Philadel&#45;<lb/>phia could not manage to have the Eastern<lb/> Preparatory School there.  You know that<lb/> it has been my ardent desire from the<lb/> commencement to have it there&#58; but&#44;<lb/> at Milwaukee&#44; when Dr Gottheil stated<lb/> that he had a child (meaning his school&#41;<lb/> that he would put under the protection<lb/> of the union&#44; and denied a committee of<lb/> examiners to be appointed &#38;c &#38;c&#44; we had to<lb/> adopt his child&#44; but that is all right.<lb/>  I know very well that there is no fear<lb/> of them ever establishing another college<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>East.  They will have the preparatory&#44; no doubt<lb/> in many cities&#44; for you will find that after<lb/> a boy spends about four years in a<lb/> preparatory school&#44; and learns as much as<lb/> is taught there&#44; that unless he wishes to study<lb/> for the ministry&#44; or to be a professional man&#44;<lb/> that he will not desire to go into the college<lb/> proper&#58; Another thing&#44; when we shall have<lb/> built a college&#44; and established a faculty<lb/> that will be the best that can be had for<lb/> money&#44; we will not fear for another college&#44;<lb/> in New York or any where else&#58; New York<lb/> and every other city has as much and more<lb/> than they can well attend to&#44; in their cong&#45;<lb/>regational matters&#44; I <del>underst</del> understand<lb/> that notwithstanding the immense wealth<lb/> and income reputed to Temple Emmanuel&#44; it<lb/> has just as much as they can do to make<lb/> both ends meet&#44; that many of their mem&#45;<lb/>bers who contributed largely have had to<lb/> <sic>succomb</sic> to the pressure of the times&#44; which<lb/> has produced a great stringency in that as<lb/> well as other congregations there.  Whilst<lb/> the congregation of Temple Emanuel is very<lb/> large&#44; still but very few are really active<lb/> members and take any great interest&#44; except<lb/> paying their dues &#38;c &#38;c.  You know how it is.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Therefore I have no fear whatever from<lb/> that quarter even at a remote period.<lb/>  Why I see an opposition already to the<lb/> Temple Emanuel&#39;s preparatory School&#44; by the<lb/> Two orthodox congregations&#44; how foolish<lb/> it is not.  I presume they teach as we<lb/> do here.  Nothing but orthodoxy&#44; what else<lb/> can be taught&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>I <sic>recieved</sic> a letter from Mr Binswan<lb/>ger about a week ago concerning a<lb/> boy from the <del>the</del> Foster Home&#44; in which he<lb/> states that the boy is in the High School<lb/> Studies&#44; and in the Hebrew that you had ex&#45;<lb/>amined him &#38;c &#38;c.  I hope that he is duly<lb/> qualified for to enter the D. Grade in both<lb/> the college and High School&#44; so that there<lb/> will be no difficulty&#44; an average of 70&#37;<lb/> in the studies of D. Grade High School will<lb/> admit him there&#44; which will not be difficult<lb/> if he knows any thing of History&#44; Eng. Grammar<lb/> and Arithmetic&#44; you may depend I will use<lb/> my efforts to make his stay here pleasant&#59;<lb/> all the boys of the college will be placed at<lb/> one House to be cared for&#44; Mr &#38; Mrs Aufrecht&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> who had been in charge of the Orphans Asy&#45;<lb/>lum at Cleveland for Eight or Nine years&#44; will<lb/> take charge of them&#44; and see to their moral and<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>religious culture&#44; if he is a good boy and at&#45;<lb/>tentive to his studies&#44; we will make a good<lb/> man of him if he lives&#44; in regard to at&#45;<lb/>tending worship&#44; I am sure from what you<lb/> have seen of Cincinnati orthodoxy you can<lb/> have no special wish for him to attend that<lb/> Synagogue.  Whilst in the Temple he can<lb/> <sic>recieve</sic> good instruction&#44; see order and<lb/> decorum&#44; we had a meeting of the<lb/> Board of Governors Sunday night to organ&#45;<lb/>ize&#44; you will see the proceedings in the<lb/> Israelite.<lb/></p>
            <p>I hope this may meet you in health<lb/> with all your dear ones&#44; tell dear Nina<lb/> she must not retaliate in <hi rend="underline">one</hi> letter score&#44;<lb/> give our love to one and all of your<lb/> dear ones.
