            <p>For Sabbath Emor<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Our Lord and Lawgiver.&#33;  Full of solemn warning is the event&#44;<lb/> with the narrative of which the lesson of this Sabbath concludes.<lb/>  It is even a Divine admonition to mothers in Israel.  For the<lb/> pages of Thy heavenly volume which record the punishment<lb/> meted out to a blasphemer&#44; connect with his crime the name of<lb/> the woman&#44; who gave him birth.  Shelomith shamed her<lb/> race by contracting a matrimonial alliance with an Egyptian<lb/> idolater&#44; and Thou didst consign her memory to the Dishonored<lb/> mention of all future generations.  Yet&#44; because Thou art<lb/> abundant in mercy&#44; Thou mightest have suffered the<lb/> offender to atone for her misdeed.  She might have contracted<lb/> the ill&#45;effects of her early error&#44; by watching with constancy<lb/> over the training of her child.  She might have prevented the<lb/> evil example of a heathen father from becoming rooted in the<lb/> heart of her son&#44; and by leading the latter in the way of godliness&#44;<lb/> have found favor in Thy sight.  But that she did not<lb/> so beneficially exercise her national powers&#44; Thou hast caused<lb/> us to understand by the ignominious death of her offspring&#44; which<lb/> gave her also an eternity of disgrace.  Oh&#33; may they<lb/> for whom Thou didst mainly design the heavenly lesson&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>ponder seriously thereon.  In an age&#44; when woman is<lb/> almost forcibly driven beyond her legitimate sphere&#44; Grant that<lb/> the daughters of Thy people comprehend may know and appreciate the field<lb/> Thou hast assigned for their labor.  May the healthful reductions<lb/> properly belonging to their sex&#44; may be never cast aside.<lb/>  For verily O Lord&#33; disastrous to our household would prove such<lb/> an occurrence.  Let our mothers understand that not by <sic>rivalling</sic> man in all his multifarious pursuits&#44; can they purify society&#44;<lb/> but rather by their guarding their own homes against pollutions&#59;<lb/> by supplying the human race with beings of high character&#44; remark&#45;<lb/>&#45;able for their piety and uprightness.  May they upon whom<lb/> chiefly devolves the duty of shaping rightly the heart of the<lb/> community&#44; be imbued with a sense of their great responsibility.<lb/>  Grant that the women of Israel may never copy the example<lb/> of the mother of the blasphemer&#44; who according to the exposition<lb/> of our Sages&#44; sought to attract by her address and manners&#44;<lb/> but imitate the model beautifully depicted in the book of<lb/> proverbs by the ancient moralist.  Like her let them glory in<lb/> being the gentle <sic>counsellors</sic> of their copartners&#44; the bright light<lb/> of their children&#39;s earthly path&#44; then will their progeny rise<lb/> and call them happy&#44; even their husbands at the gate&#44;<lb/> and bestow on them a well&#45;merited &#91;&#63;&#93; of praise.  Amen.<lb/></p>
