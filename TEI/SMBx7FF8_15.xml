            <p>546 N. Fifth Street&#44;<lb/>
                Philadelphia&#44; Pa.<lb/>
                September 11&#44; &#39;95.<lb/></p>
            <p>Honorable Joseph Blumenthal<lb/>
                My dear Sir&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>I was under the impression that a report<lb/> of the examination in June had been prepared by me<lb/> and sent to yourself and the Board of Trustees.  An<lb/> examination for promotion was to have been held last<lb/> month.  Unfortunately&#44; in a measure through my fault&#44;<lb/> all the students were not notified and only a few of<lb/> Senior B were present.  I regret that very much&#44; because<lb/> I would wish that pupils should know exactly their<lb/> standing during the term.  I regret it the more&#44; because<lb/> owing to the heavy task which the coming holidays impose<lb/> upon me&#44; the opportunity to come to New York is denied<lb/> me.  Messrs. Roeder and Cohen went over the curriculum<lb/> which I have formulated&#44; and they suggested such altera&#45;<lb/>tions as may prove acceptable.  The students in Senior B<lb/> whom I considered deserving of promotion are M. Kaplan&#44;<lb/> Elias Solomon&#44; Max Heichler and Nathan Wolf.  Some who<lb/> were absent&#44; may be equally deserving&#44; but they must undergo<lb/> an examination.  As regards the diploma&#44; I will try my best<lb/> to get it ready.  Both Wittenberg and Speaker begged the<lb/> favor of receiving it early.  The believe that it will in&#45;<lb/>sure a permanent position.  I am sorry that the Board are<lb/> disinclined to grant it to S.  He petitioned for it&#44; and<lb/> declared that his conduct hereafter would be in every re&#45;<lb/>spect exemplary.  With due respect to Messrs Cohen and<lb/> Roeder&#44; I think that he shows great familiarity with Biblical<lb/> and Rabbinical literature.  Of course&#44; neither he nor W.<lb/> was perfect&#44; but that is a qualification very rare indeed.<lb/>  The least of the three was N. as far as Biblical history is<lb/> concerned&#44; and his diploma must be guardedly worded.  I<lb/> have just seen Mr. Rothschild&#44; who kindly proposes to repeat<lb/> in behalf of the Seminary what he effectively did before.<lb/>  He agrees with me that the Convention had better take place<lb/> in N. Y.<lb/></p>
            <p>Pardon me to say&#44; that I believe no remittance was<lb/> sent for my two students during August and September&#44; I am not<lb/> positive about July.<lb/></p>
            <p>Heartily reciprocating the kind wishes you were good<lb/> enough to express and hoping that while I am <sic>premitted</sic> to live&#44;<lb/> I may be <sic>os</sic> some use&#44; I remain&#44;<lb/> Yours truly&#44;<lb/> S. Morais.<lb/></p>
