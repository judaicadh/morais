            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Who that has lived in Philadelphia for a number<lb/> of years&#44; does not know that many and frequent<lb/> and painful have been the vicissitudes of this He&#45;<lb/>brew household&#63;  Is there any here who not fami&#45; are unacquainted<lb/> liar therewith those with the circumstance of those backward turns of the wheel of fortune&#63;  I shall say nothing to them that may<lb/> excite commiseration&#44; for&#44; acceptable as human condolence<lb/> certainly is&#44; we need encouragement more than pity<lb/> in an instance like the present.  I ask for a sti&#45;<lb/>&#45;mulus to the young one to do right&#59; I long for a God&#39;s blessing to his<lb/> seniors.  I myself have now but the sincerest wishes&#44; and they are di&#45;<lb/>&#45;rected them towards the children of my deceased friends&#44;<lb/> Jules A. and Julia E.....  Sorrows did encompass<lb/> them&#44; and I feel that had not the parental faith watchfully stood<lb/> by as a watchful guardian angel&#44; cruel and crushing thoughts<lb/> might have robbed the sufferers of the all&#45;sustain&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing belief in Divine justice and Providence.  But<lb/> they have been lifted above despair for an ultimate purpose.<lb/>  I see it in the future of a family&#44; that&#44; having<lb/> reached the depth of affliction&#44; will gradually rise&#44;<lb/> under celestial escort&#44; to the apex of prosperity.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Industry and thrift and contentment&#59; the wise<lb/> training of a numerous family progeny in the path<lb/> of moderation will accomplish that devoutly to<lb/> be prayed for end.  If the dear woman<lb/> who experienced such mutations of fortune as hast&#45;<lb/>&#45;ened her death&#44; could now speak with in spiritual<lb/> utterances&#44; should she would dictate to me an address&#44;<lb/> depicting descriptive of her joyfulness in the days of success&#44; and<lb/> she would bid those whom she fondly loved to repro&#45;<lb/>&#45;duce that gladness durably for themselves&#44; by persevering in toil diligent pursuits&#44; and by<lb/> a fastening of the silvery chords of attachment&#44; that may knit together<lb/> and for ever sisters and relatives.  Oh may<lb/> the departed be gladdened exult in her supernal abode with at the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;sciousness of the well being of all her descendants.<lb/>  She surely responds &#34;Amen&#34; to my petition&#44; because<lb/> the survivors among those to whom she had given<lb/> birth&#44; did endeavour to let make her forget her fall<lb/> from a pleasurable height&#44; by anticipating her desires<lb/> and furthering her cause comforts.  She refused to be<lb/> comforted&#44; and fed upon the memory of past losses and sorrows&#44; but<lb/> having now risen above mortality and its weaknesses she<lb/> implores the Lord&#39;s lasting reward for all the living&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>so that witnessing it from heaven&#44; she may say&#44; as in<lb/> the prophetic sentence&#44; &#34;they have not toiled in vain&#44; nor<lb/> brought forth for trouble&#44; nay&#59; they are a seed blessed<lb/> of the Lord&#44; and so are their offspring in with them.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Grant it O beneficent God&#33;  Like in the time of David&#44;<lb/> command the Destroyer to hold back his hand&#44; and<lb/> vouchsafe to widen the portals of safety&#44; of health and<lb/> of happiness&#44; and let this Hebrew household enter in.<lb/>  And for the chaste wife&#44; and dear mother and kind<lb/> friend&#44; whose soul deeds will be adjudged according to Thy<lb/> infallible decree sovereign wisdom&#44; we hopefully entreat Thee O Sovereign universal<lb/> Creator.  Thou wilt cause trials to atone for trespasses&#44;<lb/> and virtues to secure Thy  mercy and Thy grace.<lb/>  The mind long tortured will be pillowed on sweet rest repose&#44;<lb/> and the spirit will ascend to everlasting glory.  Amen.<lb/></p>
