            <p>Dear hearers&#33;  I feel impelled&#44; this morning&#44; to disabuse<lb/> the mind of our young brother&#44; the Bar Mitzv&#224;&#44; fr of<lb/> an error&#44; which&#44; in common with many Jewish lads<lb/> of his age&#44; he may entertain.  It is a believe that<lb/> the bare recital of a section from the Pentateuch&#44; con&#45;<lb/>&#45;stitutes the sum and substance of the his religious duties&#44;<lb/> at this period of his life.  For&#44; they are indeed radically<lb/> wrong&#44; who so misapprehend the object of that time&#45;<lb/>honored practice.  The choosing of a passage in<lb/> the five books of Moses&#44; and the accompanying of<lb/> its perusal with an invocation to the Lord&#44; is no un&#45;<lb/>&#45;meaning form.  It stands as a solemn declaration<lb/> of faith.  It stands as an emphatic promise that<lb/> the future will be guided by the rules set forth in<lb/> those heavenly volumes.  In fact&#44; the privileges<lb/> enjoyed in the Synagogue&#44; subsequently to the<lb/> completion of the thirteenth year&#44; are founded<lb/> upon the supposition that the Hebrew lad&#44; who<lb/> has entered a new stage of existence&#44; means earnest<lb/>&#45;ly to shape his course after the model shown in the Torah.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Otherwise&#44; wherefore count him then among the ten<lb/> who may&#44; in honor of Israel&#39;s God&#44; hold public<lb/> worship&#63;  Why call him to the Law&#44; and elicit from<lb/> him a confession&#44; that it is &#91;Hebrew&#93; a heavenly boon&#44;<lb/> of his daily actions are not to illustrate the ordinances<lb/> utterance of his lips&#63;....Yes&#44; dear young brother.<lb/>  We have gladly admitted you this day among<lb/> the assembly of the faithful&#44; who hold com&#45;<lb/>&#45;munion with the Lord in His consecrated house because<lb/> we cherish the hope that you will figuratively in contribute to<lb/> come with these I swell the number thereof.  That you will frequently<lb/> come to these holy courts with prayer&#44; and behave<lb/> in the outer world&#44; conformably with the ordinances<lb/> of the book from you which you have read.<lb/></p>
            <p>Were you also to desert this hallowed spot&#44; or&#44;<lb/> visit it simply at long intervals.  Were you also<lb/> to be led into that contradictory mode of proceeding<lb/> through life&#44; that is&#44; been acknowledging yourself<lb/> a Jew&#44; still act unjewishly&#44; you would add<lb/> another disappointment to the many we have experienced.<lb/>  You would dishonor the name of Israel&#39;s God&#44; which you have<lb/> blessed in our presence&#44; and injure our holy cause.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>My dear hearers&#33;  I am warm on this subject.  For&#44; we<lb/> stand sadly in need of Israelites who will espouse<lb/> the cause of traditional Judaism.  Alas&#33; many of<lb/> its sworn defender shave proved recreant&#59; and I&#45;&#45;in my<lb/> sorrow&#45;&#45;have been seeking for new recruits wherewith to<lb/> fill the ranks of those who will fight for the Lord.<lb/>  Arise ye youths of my people with all the<lb/> enthusiasm of your ardent nature&#59; and buckle the<lb/> armor.  In vain do we hug the delusion that the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;flict will be avoided.  There can be no compromise<lb/> between a religion of convenience and a religion of sublime<lb/> self&#45;denial.  The former will gradually yield all<lb/> who hold in reverence to the worldly&#59; the letter must<lb/> resist every encroachment upon sacred ground.<lb/>  My young brother&#33;  This day you have entered the lists.<lb/>  Opponents will arise against you on all sides.<lb/>  But you may nevertheless sally forth undauntedly.<lb/>  For&#44; God upholds the faithful.  &#34;He sustaineth all who<lb/> are ready to fall&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;.

            <p>&#34;When thou goest out to battle against thy enemies&#44;<lb/> and seest horses and chariots&#44; a people more than thou&#44;<lb/> be not afraid of them&#44; for&#44; the Lord Thy God is with<lb/> Thee.&#34;  This Biblical Our Sages ever ready to afford<lb/> us instruction&#44; have applied to that Biblical verse<lb/> a metaphorical signification.  They teach this.  Both<lb/> in a moral and a religious sense&#44; man is constantly<lb/> at war with himself.  The promptings of the flesh&#44; and<lb/> human reason&#59; the our perishable nature&#44; and our immortal<lb/> essence&#44; struggle against each other to gain the ascendancy.<lb/>  But&#44; say our teachers&#44; spirit will at length conquer<lb/> matter&#44; if it will lean for support upon the arm&#44;<lb/> whereon all creation hangs&#44; even&#44; the Omnipotent God.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;He who strives to become emanci&#45;<lb/>&#45;pated from sin&#44; will obtain celestial assistance.&#34;<lb/>  Naturally as we go forth to the world&#44; and mingle<lb/> in society&#44; feelings to which we had heretofore been<lb/> strangers&#44; are awakened.  At the thought that<lb/> some obtained by foul means&#44; a life of luxuriant<lb/> ease&#44; a craving for superfluities&#44; violently assails<lb/> us.  In the figurative language&#44; borrowed from<lb/> the text&#44; we see &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;horses and chariots&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>individuals whom we deem the happiest&#44; because driving<lb/> carriages with four&#44; and at once love for pageantry&#44; ambi&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion to shine among the fashionable seize our heart.<lb/>  A <sic>turmult</sic> not unlike that of two contending armies of unequal<lb/> strength&#44; is raised within us &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But in<lb/> the arena of those combatants&#44; God stands on the side<lb/> of those who strive after righteousness&#44; of those who<lb/> grapple with vice and sin to crush them there be delivered from their<lb/> clutches.  The inimical sword is blunted when striking<lb/> against a power&#44; which is Divine.  But that power&#44;<lb/> in order to obtain the mastery&#44; must stir within us.<lb/>  It hsould not be suffered to be dormant.  Therefore<lb/> continues our text.  &#34;And it shall be that which ye<lb/> draw night into the battle&#44; the priest shall<lb/> approach and speak to the people.&#34;  The counsel<lb/> of the godly ought to infuse within our breast ad&#45;<lb/>&#45;ditional vigour.  Their exhortations encouraging us<lb/> to resist allurements&#44; and remain pure&#44; should<lb/> ever be heeded&#44; for&#44; the Creator does employ such<lb/> agencies&#44; to rescue His creatures from perdition.<lb/></p>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Bend thine ear&#44; and listen to the words<lb/> of the wise.&#34;  The priests in Biblical times&#44; the<lb/> prophets and the Rabbins in later ages cry out&#58;<lb/> &#34;Israel Hear O Israel&#44; ye draw night his day to battle<lb/> against your enemies&#44; let not your heart faint&#44;<lb/> fear not&#44; be not dismayed&#44; nor terrified from their<lb/> presence.&#34;  For&#44; the Lord your God who goeth with you&#44;<lb/> will fight for you against our enemies&#44; to save you.&#34;<lb/>  Young Israelite&#33;  In the name of those sainted men<lb/> of our nation&#44; I address you in the same strain.<lb/>  You are about to meet a formidable foe&#59; even the<lb/> world and its numberless seductions.  The difficulties<lb/> you will encounter are truly appalling.  Your efforts<lb/> to continue uncontaminated&#59; your determination to cling<lb/> to the ancestral religions&#44; will be exposed to the severest<lb/> trials.  But though never to err is more than human&#44;<lb/> yet&#44; I may with almost certainty foretell your delive&#45;<lb/>&#45;rance from the meshes of sin&#59; if you will but make<lb/> this promise&#58; always to consult&#44; &#91;&#63;&#93; you act&#44; your<lb/> best friend&#59; Almighty God&#44; whose word is the<lb/> panoply of your defence&#59; the breathing of an un&#45;<lb/>&#45;conquerable will&#44; the seed of a true happiness.<lb/></p>

            <p>Memorable is this season in which you have entered<lb/> into the discharge of sacred duties.  During the<lb/> period elapsing between the commencement of Elul<lb/> and the awe&#45;inspiring morning of Kippur&#44; Moses<lb/> our teacher&#44; stood&#44; in vigils and fasting&#44; in communion<lb/> with the Lord&#44; beseeching Him that the sin of the molten<lb/> calf might not be visited upon Israel.  Hence&#44; all<lb/> those forty days have been set apart&#44; especially by<lb/> Israelites following our ritual&#44; to propitiatory prayers.<lb/>  Join your voice with that of your elders&#44; which<lb/> will then be raised in this sacred edifice.  Bring<lb/> thus early your supplications to the footstool<lb/> of your Maker.  Entreat Him for the life of<lb/> your parents&#44; for the continuance of your health&#44;<lb/> for the brightening of your mind&#44; and for the exaltation<lb/> of your soul.  Pray that the approaching year may<lb/> be the herald of salvation to your brethren in faith&#44;<lb/> and of regeneration to mankind at large&#44; when swords<lb/> shall be beaten down into plough&#45;shares&#44; and spears<lb/> into pruning&#45;hooks.  Oh&#33; let us all&#44; my<lb/> beloved hearers&#44; implore the Lord that they who&#44; in<lb/> the language of our Haftor&#224;&#44; suffer &#34;ruin and destruction<lb/></p>

            <p>famine and sword&#44; may speedily be announced<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;  &#34;Behold&#59; I have taken out of<lb/> thy hand the cup of confusion&#44; the deep cup of my<lb/> indignation&#44; thou shalt again drink it no more&#44;<lb/> so may it be.  Amen.<lb/></p>
