                O<lb/>
                P<lb/>
                Y<lb/></p>
            <p>Philadelphia&#44; March 3&#44; 1892.<lb/></p>
            <p>Hon. Joseph Blumenthal&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>Much obliged for remittance.  I suppose<lb/> that in your report&#44; mention will be made of Gershon Levi and<lb/> Isaac Husic&#44; as students under the auspices of our Seminary.  Both<lb/> youths are doing well in their religious and secular studies.<lb/>  Later in the season&#44; I will seek an opportunity for their being<lb/> tried in the presence of our Board and the trustees.  I am glad<lb/> to state that I have just received a circular from the Phila. &#38;<lb/> Reading R. R. granting me a ticket during the current year at a<lb/> half rate.  This will save our institution a little&#44; at all events.<lb/>  Dr. Steinbach tells me that we hold our own in our Branch&#44; and<lb/> that he can remit some money he has in hand&#44; if necessary.  Prob&#45;<lb/>ably&#44; we will have a meeting of the same Branch here on Sunday<lb/> next.  I asked Mr. Lederer to call Dr. Cohen&#39;s attention to the<lb/> importance of doing so&#44; but I have not heard yet from either.<lb/></p>
            <p>About the lecture&#44; I will say&#44; that I<lb/> think I can prepare something&#44; however brief&#44; to be read to<lb/> the attendants at the Seminary&#44; one day next week.  I confess<lb/> that the evening would be better in order to draw an audience&#44;<lb/> but as my principal object is to instruct our charges&#44; the<lb/> afternoon might answer the purpose.  The talk need not be an&#45;<lb/>nounced long beforehand.  A line in one of your city papers might<lb/> suffice.  Please let me know your views&#44; for I shall devote<lb/> this day to the preparation of the topic.<lb/></p>
            <p>And now&#44; let me say a few words about the<lb/> contents of the letter&#44; enclosed in your own&#44; and which I<lb/> return herewith.  I realize the struggle which we will have<lb/> to endeavor to carry out the idea underlying the institution&#44;<lb/> but I feel that if the first young man issuing from it were<lb/> to accept a position in a &#34;reform&#34; Congregation&#44; the future<lb/> of the Seminary would be greatly <sic>imperilled</sic>.  The only one&#44;<lb/> whom we might venture to graduate&#45;&#45;though prematurely&#45;&#45;<lb/> is Joseph Hertz.  May we not hope that a conservative body<lb/> of Israelites will engage his services&#63;  I earnestly wish it.<lb/>  We would then be safe and have acted consistently.  You might<lb/> indirectly ascertain the complexion of the L. Con.&#44; and follow<lb/> a course that prudence will surely suggest to you.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr. Jastrow tells me that he has received<lb/> letters speaking in very laudatory terms of the Mr. Jaffe&#44;<lb/> whom Dr. Kohut praised in our presence.  Evidently there is<lb/> a strong pressure toward securing the services of a Hebrew<lb/> scholar&#44; residing in N. Y.&#44; and being qualified to direct the<lb/> institution.  It would certainly be exceedingly advantageous.<lb/>  I said to the Dr. that I have never met the gentleman referred<lb/> to&#44; but I would endeavor to make his acquaintance.  I wish&#44;<lb/> that&#44; besides Hertz&#44; we could anticipate early good results<lb/> from others.  I would consider that I have achieved some happy<lb/> results&#44; but when I was last in your city&#44; my personal observa&#45;<lb/>tion did not encourage that expectation.<lb/></p>
            <p>Hoping to receive a few lines very soon&#44;<lb/>
                I am&#44;		Yours truly&#44; S. Morais.<lb/></p>
