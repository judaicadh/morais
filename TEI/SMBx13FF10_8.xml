            <p>&#34;Happy is the man&#44; whose strong faith in Thee&#44;<lb/> O Lord.&#34;  Dear hearers.  Every human being<lb/> longs for happiness.  The monarch in the splendor<lb/> of his court&#44; and the prisoner in the gloom of his<lb/> dungeon.  The soldier amidst the fiery battle&#44; and<lb/> the mariner tossed upon a stormy sea.  All sigh<lb/> for happiness.  To realize it at some near period&#44;<lb/> privations are undergone&#44; new contrivances are in&#45;<lb/>&#45;vented&#44; new pleasures devised.  Yet&#44; at the very<lb/> moment we fancy to have secured it&#44; often as a<lb/> blank left in its place.  We may&#44; in truth&#44; be<lb/> compared to so many sportsmen in search of game.<lb/>  The hounds are let loose&#44; the horses spurred&#44; the<lb/> hunting horn resounds through the forest&#44; all is action&#44; but<lb/> the animal aimed at escapes&#44; and we return<lb/> breathless and exhausted to the spot from which we<lb/> started.  Yes.  Looking for happiness&#44; we fre&#45;<lb/>quently meet disappointments.  For&#44; whatever<lb/> belongs to this nether world&#44; is unavoidably weak<lb/> and imperfect&#44; hence&#44; incapable of satisfying our<lb/></p>

            <p>ever increasing aspirations and cravings.<lb/>  Besides&#58; a great hindrance to the attaining of<lb/> durable happiness is our liability to ills that all<lb/> flesh are is heir to&#44; and which all human skill<lb/> cannot remove.  It becomes then the mortals<lb/> to study&#44; in order to discover a medicine which<lb/> may allay the pains&#44; if it cannot entirely cure<lb/> diseases inherent in our nature.  The Psalmist<lb/> has pointed it out &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Happy is<lb/> the man whose strong faith is in Thee&#44; O Lord&#34;<lb/> Let us consider. Heavenly trust&#59; piety&#44; is a mighty<lb/> restorative.  Let us consider.<lb/></p>  
            <p>We are so constituted&#44; that our thoughts turn fly always<lb/> to the morrow.  In the buoyancy of youth&#44; or in<lb/> the quieter habits of ripe years&#44; the present does<lb/> not so much occupy our minds as the unknown<lb/> future.  Our wishes rush forward as billows driven<lb/> on by billows.  Thus we live&#44; to the hour that we<lb/> must quit the earth.  Now&#44; if&#44; as it is indis&#45;<lb/>&#45;putably certain&#44; our desires overleap the present&#59; our<lb/> hopes travel far&#44; with what joyful emotions ought<lb/> we to hail religion&#44; or the belief in a just God&#59;<lb/></p>

            <p>religion&#44; which points to an existence beyond these<lb/> shifting scenes of the world&#59; religion&#44; which coming&#44;<lb/> as it were&#44; between us&#44; and our delusive surroundings&#44;<lb/> raises before our mind&#39;s eye a beacon light&#44; which<lb/> guides the thoughts beyond&#44; where all is radiantly<lb/> bright.  Imagine&#44; we are walking on the<lb/> banks of a river.  Our horizon widens&#44; and we see<lb/> from afar at a distance&#44; as the Italian at the straits of Messina&#45;&#45;<lb/>a picturesque view of rich valleys and hells&#44; of<lb/> lakes and plains&#44; and yonder still&#44; a blue sky and<lb/> a sea without a ripple&#44; and further yet&#44; gorgeous<lb/> but indistinct visions&#44; swiftly following each<lb/> other&#44; we become so absorbed in that vista&#44; that<lb/> we do not cast even a passing look on the arid<lb/> ground we tread.  But if while gazing so<lb/> intently&#44; the sun is suddenly clouded&#44; and that<lb/> beautiful horizon vanishes away&#44; we then the dismal&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness of the place on which we stand&#44; strikes us<lb/> more forcibly.  In like manner does it happen<lb/> in our terrestrial existence.  Whenever religion displays<lb/> before us the heights which a just God has destined<lb/></p>

But if that cheering view is with&#45;<lb/>&#45;drawn&#44; our attention must by necessity be <sic>rivetted</sic><lb/> upon our frequent trials&#44; and the burden becomes<lb/> insufferable.  Ask it of the many who<lb/> drudge for a morsel of bread&#44; ask it of those who are<lb/> wronged or opposed&#44; they will tell that a religious<lb/> sentiment is the staff of their support.  The confiding<lb/> trust in an ever present witness to their troubles&#44; acts<lb/> as a shield against the strokes of adversity.  &#34;It pleases<lb/> the wise Ruler thus to show forth the strength of our faith.  Who<lb/> dares say to Him&#44; what doest Thou.&#34;  Such are the<lb/> feelings pervading their breasts&#44; and restoring calm<lb/> and serenity.  How well those feelings beseem all&#44;<lb/> in every state and condition of life&#59; the indigent and<lb/> the wealthy&#44; the learned and the illiterate&#44; for&#44; none can<lb/> escape a touch of the cold steel of misfortune.

What<lb/> would become of those human creatures&#44; hurled down<lb/> from a height of prosperity&#44; if not propped by<lb/> friendly Piety&#63;  The Lord who reckons our sufferings&#44;<lb/> sends a restorative equal to the urgent need.  At<lb/> the foot of His altar are comforts gathered and strewn<lb/> all over a still cherished home.  Tears may be shed&#44;<lb/> but they are pearly drops that enrich the soul&#44; because<lb/> the Lord abides them.  And they whom diseases<lb/> cut off from the pleasures of life.

            <p>as celestial messengers.  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Happy is<lb/> the man whose strong faith is in Thee&#44; O Lord&#34;<lb/>  But it is mainly at the loss of loved beings&#44; that<lb/> all&#44; save the sentiments instilled by religion&#44; in&#45;<lb/>&#45;creases rather than lessens sorrow.  The void which<lb/> death has left&#44; the hand of religion alone can is able to fill.<lb/>  Who can form an adequate idea of the anguish of mind&#44;<lb/> at the desolation which the departure of a dear one<lb/> has created&#63;  What&#44; if nothing is supplied<lb/> to dissipate that gloom&#63;  Do we perchance<lb/> consider it mainly to ward off the poignancy of<lb/> such fearful thrusts with cold insensibility&#63;  No&#58;<lb/> it is a vile weakness which banishes affection&#44; in<lb/> order to avert the pain it may produce.  It is not<lb/> him who loosens the tender chords of the heart&#44; but<lb/> he who tightens them&#44; that will grow stronger to<lb/> resist trials.  For love is power&#44; and even while it<lb/> torments&#44; it imparts fresh vigor.  But love<lb/> itself needs assistance&#44; to cleanse it from dross.<lb/>  And nowhere but a religion&#44; an succor of so noble<lb/> a nature can be sought for.  Aye&#44; my friends.

            <p>those consolations that direct our eyes to the future&#44;<lb/> are unspeakably grateful.  We then willingly incline<lb/> our ears to comforting promises&#44; which answers so well to<lb/> the longings of our hearts.  The idea of a complete<lb/> loss&#44; the thought of a total destruction is too har&#45;<lb/>&#45;rowing to be entertained.  Tears and sobs may miti&#45;<lb/>&#45;gate our pains&#44; if we can withal&#44; invoke the name<lb/> of a Sovereign Lord&#44; to whose wise decree we must bow&#44;<lb/> but if our laments are neither received nor heard&#59; if a<lb/> mist that can never be lifted has shrouded from our<lb/> sight the object we love&#44; and the same darkness is<lb/> fast encircling our own existence&#59; if the precious<lb/> hopes of eternity are denied us&#44; what horrors&#44; what an<lb/> unbearable misery&#33;  No&#44; begone soul&#45;withering<lb/> thought.  And thou O daughter of heaven&#44; holy religion&#44;<lb/> come with thy restorative balm.  Through thy asso&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciation the sentence that condemns mortals to a tempo&#45;<lb/>&#45;rary bereavement is resignedly accepted.  Through thee&#44;<lb/> we learn that sorrows can be fruitful of goodly deeds.

The<lb/> latter receive it&#44; because they believe that in the<lb/> crucible of adversity virtues are tried.  Philosophy<lb/> promises man constancy&#44; but it fails to inspire it&#44;<lb/> and Pride becomes their <sic>ricketty</sic> prop.

After having<lb/> reduced our hopes into a heap of men&#44; they leave us<lb/> without a light to find out our way.
