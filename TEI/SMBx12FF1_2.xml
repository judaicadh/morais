            <p>Brethren&#33;  The solemn festival&#44; which Israel commemorates<lb/> at this season&#44; forcibly illustrates the assertion&#44; once made by<lb/> the meekest of men&#44; to the skeptics of his age.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/>  &#34;Hereby ye shall know&#44; that the<lb/> Lord hath sent me to perform all these actions&#59; that they<lb/> are th not &#40;the inventions&#41; of my mind&#34;.  I may then<lb/> confidently refer my querist&#44; who seeks for proof of the<lb/> divine legation of Moses&#44; to the principal events that<lb/> gave origin to the institution of the Passover.<lb/></p>
            <p>They are historical fals facts&#44; familiarly known and<lb/> universally admitted.  A distinct race of men&#44; were<lb/> held in bondage by a nation most powerful among the<lb/> ancients.  For entire centuries they submissively bore the<lb/> chains that tyranny had <sic>rivetted</sic>.  Crushed to the earth<lb/> by a long servitude&#44; they neither possessed the means&#44; nor<lb/> the moral courage to strike for their freedom.  At length&#44;<lb/> a certain individual arose and vindicated their cause.<lb/></p>

            <p>With no stronger weapon than a shepherd&#39;s staff&#44; he<lb/> le coped with a dreaded kingdom&#44; till l it lay prostrate<lb/> at his feet.  He forced it to <sic>yeild</sic> its victims&#59; and<lb/> in the sight of their relentless task&#45;masters&#44; led forth<lb/> the slaves to light and liberty.  And in order<lb/> that the memory of an occurrence so important<lb/> and glorious&#44; might be perpetrated&#44; he instituted various<lb/> rites&#44; to be yearly observed by the enfranchised and<lb/> their descendants.  Now&#44; my friends&#33; upon<lb/> these facts&#44; I base my argument.  The sojourn of<lb/> Abraham&#39;s posterity and their captivity in the land<lb/> of the Pharaohs&#44; and historical realities.  They are<lb/> confessedly so by the admission of believing and unbelieving<lb/> writers.  They are attested by monuments&#44; which<lb/> have defied the mutations of time.  But the question<lb/> then arises&#58;  how did the bondmen break loose from<lb/> the fetters of Mizraim&#63;  Did their oppressors <sic>yeild</sic><lb/> at the instance of him who pleaded their cause&#63;<lb/></p>

            <p>Moses exhorted Israel to plant the standard of their faith<lb/> in the land of their future possession&#44; he expressed himself<lb/> as follows &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Ye shall observe and perform &#40;these precepts&#41; for&#44; it is your<lb/> wisdom and your understanding in the sight of all nations&#44;<lb/> who&#44; when they shall hear of these statutes&#44; will say&#58; Surely<lb/> this great nation&#44; is a wise and understanding people.&#34;<lb/>  Now&#44; my friends&#33;  Could he have so asserted&#44; whose theology<lb/> was at best&#44; according to our theologists&#44; an improvement on<lb/> the existing systems of gentilism&#63;  Would he not have thereby<lb/> rendered his tuition &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; and exposed himself&#44; to say the<lb/> least&#44; to the charges of plagiarism and dissimulation&#63;...<lb/>  But&#44; no&#44; for&#44; a minister of heaven was he&#44; upright and<lb/> fai truthful in all his ways.  It was because he had dived<lb/> into the recondite learning of antiquity&#44; that he proclaimed<lb/> that only excellent&#44; which proceeded from the fountain<lb/> of perfection.  All the knowledge that had rendered Egypt<lb/> famous&#44; had doubtless been unfolded to him&#44; for his education<lb/> was supervised by the King&#39;s own daughter.<lb/></p>

            <p>which bear testimony to its supernal origin.  Thus<lb/> by way of illustration we have been enjoined in Holy<lb/> Writ&#44; to keep the Passover in the month of Abib&#44;<lb/> which literally means&#44; at the season&#44; when vegetation<lb/> shoots forth&#59; that is&#44; at the Spring&#45;time.  But we<lb/> learn also from the same source&#44; that the commemo&#45;<lb/>&#45;rative unleavened bread must be eaten in the evening<lb/> of the fourteenth of the first month of the year.<lb/>  Now&#44; my Brethren&#33; history and a well&#45;founded tra&#45;<lb/>&#45;dition show that the Hebrew year was lunar&#44; and<lb/> consequently fall eleven days shorter than the solar<lb/> year.  It thence follows very obviously&#44; that unless<lb/> this deficiency was provided for&#44; Passover would in<lb/> process of time have fallen in the winter or autumnal<lb/> season&#44; instead of the Spring.  It became then impe&#45;<lb/>&#45;ratively necessary so to equalize the two varying<lb/> years&#44; that&#44; to the end of time&#44; Israel might solemnize<lb/></p>

Yet since the memorable time that<lb/> &#34;the law which Moses commanded&#44; became the inheritance<lb/> of the Congregation of Jacob&#34; even to this&#44; Passover has<lb/> been everywhere observed in the month of Abib at the<lb/> Spring&#45;time&#45;&#45;and in the evening of the fourteenth day<lb/> of Nissan.  Once only it was deferred by order of<lb/> King Ezekiah&#44; but though his action&#44; was prompted<lb/> by pure motives&#44; it has been animadverted on by<lb/> the Sages of the Mishn&#225;&#44; as unwarranted by Scrip&#45;<lb/>&#45;tural authority.<lb/></p>
