            <p>Funeral oration &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Friends&#33;  I have no eulogy to pronounce.  The dear woman<lb/> who lies dead before us was in very deed a faithful wife.<lb/>  But is that a peculiar merit in a Jewess&#63;  Why&#44; since we<lb/> became a nation&#44; our women have been noted for the modesty<lb/> of their demeanour.  The exceptions are&#44; thank God&#44; so<lb/> rare&#44; that the virtue of chastity in a wife&#44; can scarcely<lb/> demand from a minister of religion special praise.<lb/></p>
            <p>This dear woman was also a good mother.  Shall I bestow<lb/> a high encomium upon her character&#44; because of that trait&#63;<lb/>  As well might I eulogize the sun for giving us light<lb/> and heat.  Nature&#39;s God has implanted in the breast of<lb/> a mother a twofold share of human affection for her<lb/> children.  Every pulsation of her heart spontaneously<lb/> responds to the cry of those to whom she has given birth.<lb/>  She only obeys her instinct&#44; when she hastens to satisfy<lb/> their wants&#44; when she labors for their sake unwearily&#44; and<lb/> prefers their comforts to her own ease.  The prophet of<lb/> old&#44; wishing to describe the boundless love of God for Israel&#44;<lb/> could not find means to express it&#44; but by saying that<lb/> it exceeds that which a mother bears her young offspring&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>&#8220;Can a woman forget her babe&#44; can she forget to pity the<lb/> child of her womb&#63;  Nay&#58; these may be forgotten&#44; but I will<lb/> not forget thee&#8221;  She belies her nature&#44; she betrays<lb/> a disposition unworthy of a Jewess&#44; unworthy of a being gifted with<lb/> a soul&#44; who neglects her sons and daughters to follow<lb/> vanity and court the flattery of the worldly.<lb/></p>
            <p>This dear woman was attached to the religion in which<lb/> she had been reared.  That might perchance be<lb/> deemed some veritable cause for praise.  In a degenerate<lb/> age&#44; when the faith of Israel counts perjurers even<lb/> amidst the ranks of our women&#44; we might applaud<lb/> the conduct of her&#44; who looks to the ancestral<lb/> belief for strength and comfort in the most trying<lb/> hour of existence&#44; even&#44; when death comes nigh.<lb/>  But happily very many&#44; countless are still our<lb/> wives and mothers&#44; who lean upon the mighty arm<lb/> of the Lord when summoned to depart for the land of<lb/> spirits.  Innumerable are those yet left in our fold<lb/> who&#44; seeing the sand of life run fast down&#44; gather<lb/> their children round their dying bed&#44; and in the language<lb/> of the Almighty invoke upon their heads the threefold<lb/> blessing of the holy book.  Many will act precisely<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>like the dear woman&#44; when approaching the portals<lb/> of eternity.  But if I have nothing special<lb/> for which to eulogize our deceased sister&#44; nothing<lb/> which she did not possess in common with millions<lb/> of the wives and mothers of our race&#44; I can nevertheless<lb/> point to a moral which this silent coffin imparts.<lb/>  I mean&#44; my friends&#33; the instability of human affairs.<lb/>  The folly of relying for the continuance of our welfare<lb/> upon one&#39;s health&#44; or upon one&#39;s wealth.  Less than<lb/> two years ago&#44; this dear creature seemed to defy<lb/> sickness.  Her whole appearance denoted a vigorous<lb/> frame&#44; an exceedingly robust constitution.  Yet she<lb/> is to be laid in her rave&#44; the victim of a virulent<lb/> disease.  Less than two years ago the house of<lb/> <sic>Misstress</sic> M indicated the enjoying of competence&#44;<lb/> the gradual augmenting of temporal means.  But<lb/> now&#44; now...... My friends&#33; Why shall I<lb/> so intensify the grief which is gnawing upon the<lb/> heart&#39;s core of these unfortunate beings&#63;  Does not<lb/> the death of a Jewish mother&#44; in the prime of life&#44; who<lb/> left a numerous family&#44; and the majority of whose children<lb/> are too young&#44; to understand the extent of their loss&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>move you to tears&#63;  You weep I see over the afflict&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion that has befallen this household.  Let not your<lb/> companion be evanescent.  Let it prompt you<lb/> to deeds of brotherly and sisterly kindness.  Let<lb/> the undying spirit of the Hebrew mother be beatified<lb/> in the contemplation of the improved state of those<lb/> she loved on earth above herself.  In the knowledge<lb/> that all of you have shown active sympathy&#44; that<lb/> you have joined together to alleviate the sorrow of her<lb/> sons and daughters by a goodness which grows not weary&#44;<lb/> by a commiseration which is abiding.<lb/></p>
                <p>And you bereaved husband of this dear woman.  Let not<lb/> grief rob you of the energy you will henceforth<lb/> doubly need.  Let the performance of duty towards<lb/> those who have greater claim than heretofore to your<lb/> support&#44; sus screen you from melancholy and despondence.<lb/>  Be sustained in your trials by the thought&#44; that she<lb/> who dwells in a heavenly habitation&#44; looks approvingly<lb/> upon your exertions to promote the happiness of<lb/> your dear ones&#44; the offspring whose honored mother she was<lb/> &#38;c &#38;c.  &#40;This oration concluded with an address to the relatives of the deceased.&#41;<lb/></p>
