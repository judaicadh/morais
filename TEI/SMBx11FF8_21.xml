            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Funeral halls are not the archives of historical re&#45;<lb/>&#45;cords&#44; nor do I consider it fitting to relate on this spot<lb/> all the events of which I know of in the checkered life<lb/> of B. S.  Suffice it to say that our brother bore<lb/> melancholy vicissitudes resignedly&#45;&#45;and that is<lb/> many commendable in any of us mortals&#44; so frail &#38; fallible and weak of purpose.  But like in all<lb/> instances occasions of this sad character&#44; my concern is principally with the<lb/> survivors&#44; not so much with the departed.  For&#44; admit&#45;<lb/>&#45;ting the propriety&#44; nay&#44; the duty of performing ob&#45;<lb/>&#45;sequies over the dead in a becoming manner&#44; and<lb/> accompanying their remains to the final resting place<lb/> amidst the solemnity of prayers&#44; still the living who<lb/> are left behind to struggle mightily with diffi&#45;<lb/>&#45;culties which beset our path in every direction&#44; need our<lb/> sympathy and our active friendliness good will.  I judge that such<lb/> a thought stirred within the mind of the oldest preach&#45;<lb/>&#45;er of Biblical ages&#44; when he said &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#58; &#34;Better it is to go to the house of<lb/> mourning&#44; than to a banquetting house&#44;&#34; for in the latter<lb/> amidst merriment and sparkling wines may raise fumes that darken our minds intellect &#38; we may be<lb/> apt to forget our mortality&#44; and turn away with indifference<lb/> from the sufferings of fellow beings <sic>travellers</sic> in this earthly pilgrimage&#59; but when brought<lb/></p>

            <p>face to face with the deceased&#44; when witnessing<lb/> the sorrow of the bereaved&#44; then&#45;&#45;as Ecclesiastes tells<lb/> it&#45;&#45;&#91;Hebrew&#93; then we realize our common humanity&#44; then the<lb/> noblest sentiments instincts of our nature are may be aroused&#44; and we<lb/> feel prompted to relieve and to comfort.  The writings<lb/> of our SAges abound with instances illustrating this point&#44;<lb/> but I cannot recall at this moment one more striking<lb/> than that of a Rabbi&#44; who in the discharge of his mourn&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful obligation directed his speech to those who had assem&#45;<lb/>&#45;bled around him&#44; and where the bereft sat.  He addressed them thus&#58; Brethren&#44;<lb/> ye are the bestowers of loving&#45;kindness&#44;&#45;viz&#44; no idel cu&#45;<lb/>&#45;riosity has brought you hither&#45;&#45;but&#44; a desire to uphold<lb/> the religion of Abraham&#44; concerning whom it is recorded so chronicled<lb/> in Holy Writ &#91;Hebrew&#93; I know&#44; quoth the Lord&#44; that he will com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mand his children and his household after him&#44; to<lb/> do righteousness and justice<lb/> to lessen the weight of their burden in the hour of dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;tress.  But who&#44; my hearers&#44; stands now<lb/> most in need of a kind ministration&#44; of fraternal<lb/> condolence&#63;  The children of B S. doubtless expe&#45;<lb/>&#45;rience grief.  It were unnatural that they would<lb/></p>

            <p>consign this body of being&#44; their own father to the grave<lb/> without anguish&#59; for notwithstanding the soothing reflection<lb/> that death came to relieve bodily infirmities which<lb/> age rendered incurable&#44; yet the separation must be<lb/> painful.  It is he who labored strenuously in years<lb/> past for their maintenance and education of his offspring&#44; that is removed<lb/> from their midst&#59; it is he who strove by example to re&#45;<lb/>&#45;tain them within the ancestral fold&#59; it is he who<lb/> forged for sought their happiness and rejoiced in their joy&#44; that<lb/> has been taken hence.  But though some&#45;&#45;as I have<lb/> learnt&#45;&#45;postponed for a time conjugal and maternal obli&#45;<lb/>&#45;gations to filial dutifulness&#44; and all of them will do<lb/> the memory of their parent reverence&#44; still each will<lb/> meet comfort in the pursuit of various walks of life.<lb/>  Their mother is the deepest mourner.  Many years of A very long<lb/> a companionship must naturally intensify affection&#44;<lb/> and the widow will greatly miss her the copartner of<lb/> her youth&#44; he that shared her pleasures and tribulations.  Friends may offer consolation they ought&#44; according to the dictum of the Rabbi have cited&#44; show<lb/> tokens of practical kindness&#44; but children must inces&#45;<lb/>&#45;santly demonstrate that the welfare of their mother<lb/> is nigh to their hearts.  By virtue of my office<lb/> I ask them in the name of the God of Abraham<lb/></p>

Endeavour&#44; I pray&#44;<lb/> jointly to sweeten the cup of sorrow put to her lips.<lb/>  You can best understand how to temper its bitterness<lb/> by means that are most effective.  A tender compassion consideration which<lb/> anticipates wishes and prevents heart burnings&#44; gentle<lb/> speaking&#44; and the exercise of self&#45;denial to promote<lb/> your mother&#39;s welbeing&#44; will cause the winter of<lb/> her existence to be spent in the enjoyment of pious<lb/> contentment.  May you follow this course&#44; and<lb/> be rewarded by Him who promised to crown filial goodness with temporal and spi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ritual blessings. to  And Thou O God&#33; vouchsafe to<lb/> endow the progeny of Thy servant B. S with the capacity<lb/> to do righteousness and justice.
