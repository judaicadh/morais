            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>No sensible person should boast simply because he has<lb/> derived his extraction from a worthy parentage&#44; but to<lb/> those who follow in the wake of an upright ancestry&#44; the<lb/> knowledge of such a descent must bring veritable pleasure.<lb/>  We Israelites take special pride in the righteous venerable deeds of the fathers&#44; and<lb/> recall them in our national prayers&#44; when we exclaim&#58; &#34;Thou O God rememberest for our sake the piety devotion of the patriarchs.&#34;<lb/>  I am aware that<lb/> this circumstance has given rise to a painful an unjust a charge painful to my our feelings&#59; to<lb/> the accusation of our being an ostentatious and uncosmopo&#45;<lb/>&#45;litan race&#44; unduly always vaunting our lineage and mission the nobility of our mission&#44; but I bear with the false accusation imputation and<lb/> in spite thereof rejoice whenever I perceive that the virtues<lb/> of our predecessors are wisely extolled by being practically cherished I mean&#44; by a reproduction among their successors.<lb/>  Now wishing to apply the sentiment which I have just expressed&#44;<lb/> I will say&#44; that the offspring of Moritz Loeb may point<lb/> with unfeigned satisfaction to the life career of their aged father.<lb/>  That he resided for a series of years in one locality&#44; and suc&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceeded in winning public respect&#59; that for several decades<lb/> he conducted a paper journal in a foreign language in English&#45;speaking America<lb/> and yet conciliated the good&#45;will of the natives&#44; without regarding no susceptibilities&#44; avoiding to offending<lb/> those who differed from him in political principles&#59; all of that must<lb/> be regarded by his sons and daughters a cause for a well<lb/> founded boast.  For To So has testified the daily press and testified&#44; and I have moreover learned that in their<lb/> the bereaved ment they grief&#44; the have been comforted by the in their grief the assurances of<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>of fraternal condolence from distinguished men of distinction.  But<lb/> I&#44; as a servant of Israel&#39;s God&#44; direct their atten&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion to the path of honor integrity pursued by the venerable de&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceased parent&#44; as that which they must tread upon&#44; in order<lb/> to perpetuate the good name they have inherited and<lb/> continually rightly deserve the esteem of the community.  I&#44;<lb/> confess that in my capacity&#44; I experience also a degree of gratification at counting<lb/> among my senior colleagues&#44; who taught sacred lore&#44; a<lb/> brother of the lamented departed Dr Henri Loeb&#44; the emeritus late Chief Rabbi in<lb/> Belgium&#44; one of whose volumes of instruction&#44; one which was translated<lb/> in our vernacular&#44; has long served as a text book in our<lb/> religious Sunday schools&#44; together with a prayer which he composed for the closing of the religious exercises.  Still pleasing as that may be also to the mourners&#44; I contend that a soothing<lb/> balm to the wound bleeding sore&#44; which the loss of a loving father in&#45;<lb/>&#45;flicted created&#44; must be the truth enunciated is only the remedy indicated by our sages&#44; namely&#44;<lb/> a life of virtue&#59; for our own virtuous actions are the genuine gold purchasing<lb/> solace and a merited commendation.  The offspring progeny of Moritz Loeb<lb/> will feel comforted by reflecting on the example received&#44;<lb/> and more so by determining to conform therewith.  The<lb/> daughters of the lamented Israelites&#44; having con&#45;<lb/>&#45;tracted conjugal duties&#44; and being bound besides<lb/> by the sacred ties of maternity&#44; will naturally re&#45;<lb/>cover by the degrees &#91;&#63;&#93; from the blow sustained sooner than their mother.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>It is the widow who calls therefore for my deepest sympathy.<lb/>  True Correct as I believe the Rabbinical axiom generally to<lb/> be&#44; that the absence of a wife is deplored most by her<lb/> husband&#44; I hold likewise that the demise of the latter<lb/> is most keenly felt by the former.  In the present<lb/> instance the very fact that the deceased required the<lb/> constant attention and solicitude of his life&#45;compa&#45;<lb/>&#45;nion&#44; will render his departure more melancholy unutterably sad&#44; for it will<lb/> have occasioned a void&#44; which robs home of its at&#45;<lb/>&#45;tractions and turns it very night into a solitude.<lb/>  Human language must necessarily fail to procure relief<lb/> to such a sorrows.  The promises of reason and faith&#44;<lb/> will can assuage it and they will&#44; I hope&#44; afford the widow the calm serenity of pious resignation.  I<lb/> hope&#44; For she must realize that the mind once<lb/> illumined with a bright understanding can never perish<lb/> like the senseless and material flesh.  She must<lb/> also have learned from Holy Writ that the spirits<lb/> sees not destruction&#44; for it partakes of the essence<lb/> of the all&#45;spiritual God.  Nevertheless But though so blissfully sustained&#44; it is<lb/> largely from those to whom she gave birth<lb/> that the relict of our coreligionist Moritz Loeb&#44;<lb/> must draw derive ceaseless comfort.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>They must be brought draw closer still to their mother<lb/> by a filial devotion which admits of no weariness.<lb/>  They Sons and daughters must endeavour jointly to render cheer the writer of<lb/> her existence cheerful though by with the warmth of an un&#45;<lb/>abated affection.  May they resolve to do so and<lb/> merit become thereby the recipients of a celestial reward&#44; experienced in this life and<lb/> met in that world which has no end.  And now let us<lb/> pray that the depositing of the one body of our fellow&#45;believer into its final<lb/> abode on the eve of the Sabbath&#44; may signify an be a prognostic of foreshadow<lb/> allotted Sabbath rest a repose where immortality reigns.  May<lb/> the qualities of the mind and of the heart which our<lb/> departed brother exercised righteously&#44; gain for him<lb/> consummate bliss&#44; and may all his supreme repose and beatitude.  Oh Eternal.  Let the shortcomings of thy servant as<lb/> a man and an Israelite be hidden beneath the wings<lb/> of everlasting Thy unfailing mercy&#44; even as it is written&#58; &#34;I&#44; yea<lb/> I blot out thy trespasses for my own sake&#44; and<lb/> thy sins I will remember no more&#44;&#34; and as thy<lb/> inspired psalmist has declared &#34;The Lord is merciful<lb/> and compassionate&#44; slow to anger and plen&#45;<lb/>teous in loving kindness.&#34;  So may it be O<lb/> Lord&#44; our Universal Parent and Saviour&#33;.  Amen.<lb/></p>
