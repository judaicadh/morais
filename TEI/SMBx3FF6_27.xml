            <p>Rev S. Morais&#59;<lb/>
                Philada.&#44; Pa.<lb/>
                My Rev. Teacher&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>First of all I have to crave<lb/> your pardon for addressing myself to you in the vernacul&#45;<lb/>ar&#44; &#38; not in the language you prefer to correspond in<lb/> with your pupil. The arrival of the last issue of the<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Israelite</hi> put me out of the humor of writing Hebrew.<lb/> Hebrew&#44; the language of <hi rend="underline">Truth</hi>&#44; is the language of the Is&#45;<lb/>raelites &#38; before me lies a paper &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; replete<lb/> with bare&#45;faced <hi rend="underline">falsehoods</hi>&#33;&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>By this time you have doubtlessly seen  the paper in<lb/> question&#8212;did you read my article on &#34;Intermarriages&#34; &#38; the<lb/> &#34;Editorial Postscript&#34; therein contained&#63; I do not ask<lb/> this question out of  impure motives&#58; out of the desire to<lb/> know whether my kind teacher has honored me by perusing<lb/> my crude thoughts&#59; but because I am anxious to know<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#63; &#38;therefore I propound the above<lb/> question. &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> this is  not the question. But do you find<lb/> my humble effort faithfully representing the views of<lb/> the opponents of the amalgamation schemers&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>That I have succeeded to&#91;&#63;&#93; in upsetting Wise&#39;s theories<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; I infer from the fact that the Wise man<lb/> has nothing to say in reply to my arguments &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;<lb/> except that &#39;none of his statements is attacked by me&#39;&#45;&#45; <lb/>&#38; this is a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; English&#58;a black lie&#33;&#95;&#95;Who said&#44;<lb/>&#34;You see that &#94; the reason of this prohibition &#91;of intermarriage&#93;&#91;previous brackets inserted by author&#93; is <del></del> not&#93; none<lb/> of race&#44; color or any other corporal accident&#34;&#63; Not Hirsch&#44;<lb/> not Stern&#44; but Dr. Wise&#59; &#38; at the close of Part 1 of my<lb/> paper I prove that race had as much to do with the<lb/> prohibition as religion.&#45;&#45;Who asserted that &#39;the Rabbis<lb/>adopted the <hi rend="underline">minority</hi> opinion of R. Simeon&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; &#38; not that of<lb/> the majority opposed to him&#39;&#63; Dr. Wise&#33; And in part 2<lb/> of my paper I show that R.S. was not the author of that<lb/> opinion&#44; but that he simply delivered it as a <hi rend="underline">Halakha</hi> adopted<lb/></p>

Z. &#91;Y.&#93; is left there in the minority&#44; &#38; strange to<lb/> say&#44; has been made law by the code. We know not on what<lb/> principle&#34;&#63; The paper itself answers&#58; &#34;<hi rend="underline">Ed. Israelite</hi>&#34;&#59; &#38; in <lb/> part 3 of my paper I controvert this assertion&#44; &#38; in part<lb/>4 expound the principle on which the law is based&#33; In&#45;<lb/>deed&#44; my whole essay is directed against Dr Wise whose<lb/> every assertion is demonstrated to be the creation of<lb/> his brains &#38; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; not even &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#95;&#95; Dr&#39;s<lb/>Hirsch &#38; Stern being brought in just for company&#39;s<lb/> sake&#95;&#95;&#38; yet he says in his &#34;Postscript&#44;&#34; that &#39;none of<lb/> his points is attacked in the above essay&#33;&#33;&#95;&#95; Moreover&#44;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; he reiterates in the &#34;Postscript&#34; the very<lb/> ideas I refute in my paper&#44; <del></del>  &#93; &#38; styles these &#34;facts&#44;&#34; as<lb/> if  there were no doubt as to their being facts&#33;&#95;&#95;Un&#45;<lb/>forunately&#44; &#38; I say this with a sense of sorrow for the Re&#45;<lb/>ligion I have been taught to revere&#44; I know that only &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> will read my article&#44; while all will read<lb/> Wise&#39;s postscript &#38; ninety nine out of every 100 will take<lb/> his words for it &#38; consider it as &#91;Hebrew&#93;.&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>

            <p>Now&#44; what is to be done to counteract the effects of<lb/> the idolatrous worship paid the Wise man of the West&#63;<lb/> My voice is too weak to silence him. Besides&#44; his false&#45;<lb/>hoods are more powerful than my truths. &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/>&#91;Hebrew&#93; &#45;&#45;&#38; Wise &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#33; And yet&#44; is<lb/> this &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#63; The pacific policy of the conscientious<lb/> Rabbis in this country has raised that man to the<lb/> dignified position he occupies &#38; rendered him second only<lb/> to the keeper of St.Peters&#39;s key to heaven&#44; &#38; the continuance<lb/> of that policy is paramount to wearing around his<lb/> brazen brow a crown of laurels every fiber of which<lb/> is a thorn in the side of Judaism. Can the &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/>&#91;Hebrew&#93; afford to maintain silence&#63;&#45;&#45; Pardon me for speak&#45;<lb/> ing thus to you &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#33; My heart actually<lb/> aches within me whenever I think of the evil that man<lb/> has brought to Judaism&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/> I am powerless &#38; my pen is suffering with chronic impoten&#45;<lb/>cy&#59; your arm is  strong&#44; your pen prolific&#44; your name<lb/> revered&#44; your word respected&#58; I candidly think that you <lb/> are the one &#91;Hebrew&#93;.&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>Yesterday I received from Berlin a copy of Frankel&#39;s<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="5"/>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; am therefore able to return to you the copy you<lb/> kindly lent me some seven months ago. I forward it<lb/> to your address by to&#45;day&#39;s mail&#44; registered&#44; &#38; hereby<lb/> tender you my heartfelt thanks for the loan. I have<lb/> made frequent use of it&#44; but hope that you will &#94; find the<lb/> book in no worse condition for all that.&#95;&#95; The copy<lb/> I received will cost me some &#36;4 50<lb/>100&#47; &#95;&#95; an enormous<lb/> price for such a work&#44; but I must have it &#38; pay<lb/> for it&#33;</p>
            <p>For the present I shall be a  &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; i.e. I shall<lb/> not reply to Wise&#39;s postscript&#44; but wait till I hear<lb/> from Hirsch &#38; Stern &#38; then shape my course.<lb/></p>
            <p>With kindest regards &#38; best wishes for yourself &#38; your dear children&#44; in which my wife cordially joins&#44; <lb/> I have the honor to subscribe myself&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your faithful pupil<lb/>
