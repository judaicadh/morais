            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren.<lb/>  The distance of time and place which separated me<lb/> from my sister in faith&#44; now unhappily enshrouded<lb/> in this coffin&#44; prevents my paying to her the last tri&#45;<lb/>&#45;bute of respect&#44; in as worthy a manner as perhaps it<lb/> is her due.  Being unacquainted with her history since<lb/> her marriage&#44; which occurred possibly a quarter of a<lb/> century ago&#44; I cannot rightly bestow praises upon her&#44;<lb/> for her demeanour in the various relations of life&#44; and as<lb/> a professing Jewess.  I knew that she cherished<lb/> the memory of the spot in which she was raised<lb/> to womanhood&#44; and the house of prayer in which she<lb/> had <sic>worshipped</sic> her Creator in the days of her youth&#44; but<lb/> the part she acted on the scene of the world around her&#44;<lb/> from the day that I congratulated her as a bride&#44; I am unable to tell and eulogize.  This&#44; however&#44; I be&#45;<lb/>&#45;lieve I can say with correctness&#44; that the tender af&#45;<lb/>&#45;fection which Lizzie Hirsch bore her offspring was a sharp &#91;&#63;&#93; which cut<lb/> her existence short.  The loss of children&#44; notably that<lb/> of a daughter in the bloom of life&#44; intellectually bright&#44;<lb/> lovely in disposition&#44; and winning in manners&#44; was a<lb/> wound to the heart&#44; from which the fond mother never recovered.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Only the eye that sees our inmost parts&#59; the<lb/> eye of God can have discerned the gloom which<lb/> overspread that mind at the thought of the darling<lb/> object buried in a Philadelphia Jewish cemetery.<lb/>  To dwell upon that thought two years and<lb/> three months&#44; must have been to invite death<lb/> and sink into an early grave.  Therefore it is<lb/> that we have gathered together for the perform&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance of a sad duty.  But when our<lb/> Rabbis were situated as I am now&#44; they did not<lb/> let their feelings overcome their reasoning powers.  They<lb/> understood that death is but a transition from the last<lb/> stage of a temporal existence&#44; to the first stage of<lb/> a spiritual life.  Hence they used to say&#58; &#34;Weep for<lb/> the mourners&#44; and not for the deceased&#44; for the latter<lb/> is at rest&#44; but the survivors are in anguish&#34;  Yes&#58;<lb/> unfortunate husband and father&#44; my sympathies<lb/> are with you&#44; who have been left on earth to lament<lb/> the demise of wife and daughter&#44; the loss of<lb/> support and pleasure&#44; of an adviser and a solace.<lb/>  For you I have entreaties to the God of the spirit<lb/> of all flesh&#44; that He may sustain you in a<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>twofold trial&#59; that He may open to you a way<lb/> by following which you will yet obtain comfort.<lb/>  For your sake I supplicate the throne of Grace that you<lb/> may be lifted up from this sorrow&#44; by engaging in<lb/> acts of charity and piety.  You may trust a<lb/> brother who has had a peculiarly sad experience&#44; and<lb/> believe that the only means to allay our own distress&#44;<lb/> is to go in search of the afflicted and endeavour<lb/> to lessen their suffering.  Some who are<lb/> bereaved of dear relatives will inconsiderately seek<lb/> to drown their sorrow in the intoxicating bowl&#44;<lb/> others will seek to forget it in debauchery.  They<lb/> who follow that path go to meet what is<lb/> certain to hasten their bodily destruction and blacken ruin<lb/> their character.  The sensible ones&#44; will on the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;trary will study what is sure to afford them relief&#44;<lb/> while <sic>benefitting</sic> others in misery.  May you be<lb/> reckoned among the wise in that respect.  May your<lb/> son learn from you to pursue righteousness amidst<lb/> all human events.  Then will your heart be glad&#45;<lb/>&#45;denned&#44; and when the keen grief you now experience<lb/> shall have abated&#44; you will thank God for having exercised<lb/> resignation.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>&#40;Here followed an invocation to God&#41;<lb/></p>
