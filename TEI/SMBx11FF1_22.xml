            <p>My young friend B. M. for &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>Let me draw your attention for a few moments to<lb/> the sentiments which stirred within the breast of<lb/> Jacob&#44; when he awoke from his dream.  He felt<lb/> much comforted&#44; and so grateful to God for having<lb/> quieted his spirit in the hour of distress&#44; that<lb/> he made a solemn promise.  If God would be<lb/> with him&#44; that is&#44; if no dangers befell him by the way&#44;<lb/> and when he reached his destination&#44; his own indus&#45;<lb/>&#45;try would be so divinely blessed&#44; as to afford him<lb/> a living&#44; and he would come back in peace to<lb/> his father&#39;s house&#44; as a proof of the Lord&#39;s merci&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful favor interposition&#44; then he would devote the place in which<lb/> he had slept that night to a religious purpose&#44;<lb/> and distribute some of his earnings among the poor.<lb/>  You must have noticed a particular wish in the<lb/> vow pronounced&#59; a wish containing a volume of<lb/> filial tenderness&#59; a wish deeply touching.  Jacob<lb/> prayed that he might return to the home&#44; in<lb/> which he was born &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  What<lb/> was there in that home which he so longed after&#63;<lb/>  A treasure&#44; my young friend&#44; a treasure dearer<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>than all the riches which he might gain when away form<lb/> it&#45;&#45;the love of father and mother which is beyond<lb/> bounds.  Many a child has been compelled to leave<lb/> home in search of a livelihood&#44; and he felt deso&#45;<lb/>&#45;late&#44; but time lessened the pain&#44; and when prosperity<lb/> attended his work&#44; he gradually forgot the home<lb/> of his early days in the enjoyment of the present<lb/> success.  Many a child has left home&#44; because<lb/> the wholesome restraints of parents was unwisely<lb/> considered irksome&#44; but after years had rolled on&#44;<lb/> he remembered the counsel of those who looked only<lb/> to his happiness&#44; and he would seek it again&#44; had if<lb/> they who gave it had not departed from earth.<lb/>  The history of Jacob is doubtless well known to<lb/> you.  On the night that he laid his head upon<lb/> a stone for a pillow&#44; his dream was not of the<lb/> gold which he might enjoy by following his own<lb/> unchecked will.  He experienced anguish because<lb/> circumstances forced him to become an exile&#44; and<lb/> from that hour&#44; throughout twenty long years of con&#45;<lb/>&#45;stant industrial efforts&#44; the thought of home<lb/> never departed from his memory.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>It stood before his mind&#44; when he said to Levan<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;Let me go to my native place<lb/> and to my land.&#34;  It recurred to him again and<lb/> again in his dreams&#44; when he heard an angel&#39;s voice<lb/> exclaiming &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Jacob&#44; re&#45;<lb/>&#45;turn to the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred&#44;&#34;<lb/> and the sweetest moment to the exile was when<lb/> he revisited the home of his infancy.<lb/></p>
            <p>You possess a home&#44; in which you may peacefully<lb/> remain.  Value it&#44; my young friend&#44; for however<lb/> humble&#44; you will meet therein a treasure in the af&#45;<lb/>&#45;fection of parents.  But you yourself can heighten<lb/> its worth by a conduct that will add years to those<lb/> who have given you earthly existence.  Begin from<lb/> this day to study how you can become a help in<lb/> that home&#44; how you can make somewhat lighter<lb/> the heavy task which a numerous family imposes<lb/> on your father and mother.  Heed the advice of the<lb/> latter&#44; and never that of pretended friends&#44; who will<lb/> mislead you&#44; and&#44; after you have fallen low&#44; will keep<lb/> you in a state of misery to suffer the effects of your<lb/> indiscretion.  Believe that none cares for your real<lb/> welfare more than those whom nature and nature&#39;s<lb/></p> 
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>God have appointed as your guardians&#44; and<lb/> you will grow to be an honor to yourself&#44; a plea&#45;<lb/>&#45;sure to your family&#44; a source of benefit to<lb/> your country&#44; to your people and your religion.<lb/></p>
