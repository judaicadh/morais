                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>Mr Arthur Todd<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I will very briefly explain for your information&#44;<lb/> the application of the 13 rules&#44; which we are advised by the<lb/> Rabbins to read every day&#44; in order to keep up their know&#45;<lb/>&#45;ledge.<lb/>
                1.  If the respect due to one&#39;s parents is such that a person<lb/> publicly rebuked by them&#44; would feel&#44; greatly ashamed&#44;<lb/> should he not who is rebuked by God&#44; viz who has clear<lb/> evidences of God&#39;s displeasure&#44; feel woefully disgraced&#63;<lb/>
                2.  We learn from a certain transaction mentioned in the<lb/> Bible that the verb &#91;Hebrew&#93; implies an acquisition made<lb/> by money.  From that we judge that whenever the same<lb/> verb occurs in connection with a purchase the idea must<lb/> be understood &#40;though not expressed&#41; that money was given.<lb/>
                3.  We find in one or two scriptural verses that in such a<lb/> day a kind of labor is prohibited or permitted.  We infer<lb/> therefrom that <del>that same</del> the rate applies to all days <del>that</del> which the<lb/> law places in the same category.<lb/>
                4.  An ordinance spoken of in general terms and then speci&#45;<lb/>&#45;fied&#44; is to be understood to embody whatever has been stated<lb/> specifically.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>5.  An ordinance laid down in all its particulars&#44; and then<lb/> repeated in general terms&#44; is to be understood as including all<lb/> the particulars already mentioned.<lb/>
                6.  Should that ordinance be stated first in general terms&#44; then<lb/> specifically and then again in general terms&#44; the law is as<lb/> in the two preceding rules.<lb/>
                7.  &#91;&#63;&#93; a general rule needs some specification&#44; to know<lb/> when and how it is to be applied&#44; and so likewise a specific rule<lb/> might be misapplied&#44; were it not that a general rule limits<lb/> its application.<lb/>
                8.  A general rule is made&#44; for instance&#44; concerning the inviolability<lb/> of all sacred objects.  Should a particular rule be found in connection<lb/> with one of those objects&#44; the same rule applies to all.<lb/>
                9.  In the regulation relating to the impurity of the body&#44; all<lb/> diseases might be comprehended.  If the text makes special mention<lb/> of one or two of them&#44; it shows that they were not included<lb/> in the general regulation&#44; and the same strict law is not appli&#45;<lb/>&#45;cable to them.<lb/>
                10.  But when those cases of which special mention is made do<lb/> not altogether belong to the same character of objects&#44; for which<lb/> the general rule was made&#44; then the Bible intends to teach us<lb/> that in some cases we need not be very rigid&#44; while in others<lb/> great strictness is required<lb/>
                11.  A specialty which is dwelt upon and disagrees <del>from</del> with the general<lb/> tenor of the rule made&#44; cannot be said to belong to it&#44; unless the<lb/> text proves it so.<lb/>
                The other last two rules can be easily understood.<lb/>
                I am aware that what I have written throws but a faint light upon<lb/> the subject&#44; yet it may render a <del>passage</del> portion of the ritual&#44; which few<lb/> can understand who are not thoroughly familiar with <del>the</del> Talmudical reasoning&#44;<lb/> a little <del>more</del> clearer to your <del>understanding</del> mind.  Yours<lb/> S Morais<lb/></p>
