            <p>For Chakat and Balak<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Grant O Lord&#33; that we may gain a correct under&#45;<lb/>&#45;standing of that which our holy men of old have written.<lb/>  Specially are we eager for a right comprehension&#44; when<lb/> pondering on that part of the sacred book&#44; which contains is most<lb/> revered&#44; because it contains Thy perpetual ordinances.<lb/>  Human reason rises at times unbidden to gainsay what<lb/> the pen of inspiration has registered.  Thus in the twofold<lb/> section of this Sabbath&#44; various incidents startle the mind.<lb/>  We can readily recognize Thy justice&#44; O Lord&#33; which visited<lb/> upon the two messengers of Thy will a light error with<lb/> severity.  For&#44; by those who come nearest unto Thee&#44; is Thy<lb/> name to be publicly hallowed&#44; in order that all may<lb/> stand in dread of sin.  Moses and Aaron who suffered<lb/> anger to erase Thy command from their memory&#44; so that<lb/> instead of ordering the rock to gush out water for the thirsty&#44;<lb/> struck it wrathfully&#44; though incensed by our father&#39;s<lb/> constant tempting of Thy power&#44; fell under Thy dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;pleasure and were denied the joy of entering the goodly land.<lb/>  That event so grievous to the righteous&#44; discloses Thy way<lb/> which is perfect&#44; and Thy Divine rule which is no respecter of<lb/> persons.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>But we cannot dive into the meaning of the occurrence&#44;<lb/> which relates that a look directed towards a brazen<lb/> serpent healed our ancestors&#44; whose blood&#44; the agent of<lb/> Thy upright judgment&#44; a live serpent&#44; had poisoned.<lb/>  Taught by Thy prophets to believe&#44; that contrition and the<lb/> relinquishing of our evil doings are the restorers of Thy<lb/> favor&#44; we are unable to comprehend how those sickened&#44;<lb/> because of their transgression&#44; found a cure by gazing on<lb/> a statue.  We hate froward thoughts&#44; and love Thy word&#44;<lb/> O Lord&#33; but we crave for light that we may put faith<lb/> in Thy book with a whole heart.  Thus we also fully<lb/> credit the narrative that a heathen soothsayer was made<lb/> by Thee to <sic>unvail</sic> the future&#44; and utter&#44; against his own<lb/> will&#44; devout wishes&#44; and truths sublime&#59; for&#44; to rebuke<lb/> the king who had hired a wizard to harm Thy redeemed<lb/> people&#44; Thou didst inspire Balaam to exclaim &#34;No enchant&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment can avail against Jacob&#44; and no divination against<lb/> Israel&#34;.  But we who know that a man&#39;s malediction<lb/> can injure none&#44; without Thy heavenly sanction&#44; cannot<lb/> understand why the lips open to curse were forced to bless.<lb/>  Nor can our unaided reason find an adequate cause for<lb/> the gift of speech seemingly bestowed upon an irrational being&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>and for its having been favored with a supernatural<lb/> apparition&#44; withheld from the master thereof.<lb/>  Verily&#58; our teachers have striven to unfold by their discernment<lb/> and fittingly to explain what the human mind is prone<lb/> to controvert.  From them we have learnt that not the<lb/> mere staring at the brazen serpent&#44; but that a penitent<lb/> look upturned towards Thee O Lord&#33; brought on the healing of<lb/> the diseased sinners.  They have likewise told us that the<lb/> scrupulous care of our predecessors not to wage war against<lb/> Moab&#44; because of the ancient relationship existing&#44; might<lb/> have been interpreted as the effect of Balaam&#39;s imprecation&#44;<lb/> and therefore Thou didst not permit the Syrian magician to prac&#45;<lb/>&#45;tise on Thy tribes his deceptive art.  And some of our pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceptors have intimated that the episode relative to the<lb/> journey of the sorcerer to meet Balak&#44; and the appearing<lb/> of an angel with a drawn sword&#44; seen first by the dumb<lb/> creature&#44; happened in a vision which Thou didst vouchsafe&#44;<lb/> to reprove him who deemed his magical powers supreme.<lb/>  But men are fallible.  However useful their instruction&#44; and<lb/> satisfactory their elucidations&#44; they may not always be the<lb/> breathing of the spirit of truth.  Aid us Thou O Lord in<lb/> our meditations.  Guide our thoughts aright&#44; that we<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>may discover all which is hidden&#44; penetrate all which is<lb/> obscure in the revealed volumes.  With Thy pious Psalmist<lb/> we cry &#34;Let Thy face shine on Thy servants&#44; and teach us<lb/> Thy statutes.&#34;  Then will we quell the tumults of a rebellious<lb/> mind&#44; and join into a holy alliance reason with faith.<lb/>  Grant us that capacity Thou who delightest in the<lb/> sincere belief of Thy children&#59; and let the words of our<lb/> mouth&#44; and the desires of our hearts be acceptable before<lb/> thee&#44; O Lord Our Rock&#44; and our Redeemer.  Amen.<lb/></p>
