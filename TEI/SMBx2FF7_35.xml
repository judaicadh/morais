            <p>Hannover May 25&#47;79.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. S. Morais.<lb/></p>
            <p>A sight of my face on paper&#44;<lb/> and a few lines from me&#44; may surprise<lb/> you my good and respected friend&#44; but<lb/> it will show you that I have not<lb/> forgotten one who has ever by his kind<lb/> acts endeared himself to me and to my<lb/> family&#44; and as I do not know your<lb/> exact address&#44; I enclose this in a letter<lb/> to my sister Miriam.  I did expect to<lb/> have visited this season the land of my<lb/> Birth&#44; and those there so dear to me&#44;<lb/> but I am afraid I shall have to defer<lb/> such a visit and such a pleasure God willing<lb/> to some future period.  My dear wife<lb/> and children are Thank God all well&#44; and<lb/> we seem to have fallen into the ways and<lb/> customs of this country and its people.<lb/>  We live happily&#44; in the midst of a pleasant<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>and large Jewish community&#44; and<lb/> altho the Minhag is much different from<lb/> that in which I have been reared&#44; still<lb/> I have managed to accustom myself to it.<lb/>  You can well imagine that it is a<lb/> great pleasure to me that here&#44; the<lb/> congregation are strictly orthodox and<lb/> mostly observant Jews.  The majority<lb/> observe the Sabbath&#44; closing their places<lb/> of business and living in conformity with<lb/> our ancient Laws.  The Synagogue is<lb/> open twice daily throughout the entire<lb/> year&#44; and we have a Hazan&#44; whose<lb/> fine voice accompanied by a choir of<lb/> male voices&#44; renders the service very<lb/> agreeable and impressive.  Our Land Rabbiner<lb/> Dr Meyer&#44; a Brother of my mother&#45;in&#45;Law&#44;<lb/> is a man much respected all over Germany&#44;<lb/> and particularly beloved by his flock in this<lb/> city&#44; and the synagogue is large and handsome.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>The schools in Hannover are celebrated&#44;<lb/> thereby enabling our children to receive<lb/> a very good education.  The Hebrew and<lb/> Religion school directed by Dr Mayer&#44; and<lb/> with a corp of Teachers headed by Dr Pr&#228;ger<lb/> formerly of Breslau is also very good&#44; and<lb/> the children receive a thorough education<lb/> in Hebrew and their religious duties.<lb/>  I trust the description I have given you<lb/> of our surroundings here&#44; will not be<lb/> uninteresting to you.  I often think of you<lb/> and of our old timed Friendship&#44; and trust<lb/> with God&#39;s help it goes well with you and<lb/> yours.  It seems to me like a dream<lb/> that I have been so long away from<lb/> my native land and its familiar scenes&#44;<lb/> and seeing my dear children growing up<lb/> around me&#44; I can see how time passes.<lb/>  My dear mother writes to me weekly&#44; and<lb/> as at present I cannot see her face&#44; I<lb/> hail her letters as one of my great pleasures.<lb/>  I was indeed pained to hear from her<lb/> of the misfortunes in the family of my<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>old friend and relative Mr A Hart.<lb/>  It is indeed a said trial for them&#44;<lb/> and may the One above solace them<lb/> in their afflictions.  Please be so kind as<lb/> to remember me kindly to them when<lb/> opportunity offers&#44; also to my old friends<lb/> Misses Peixotto &#38; Bomeisler.  You will also<lb/> accept from me and my dear wife<lb/> our best regards and wish for yourself<lb/> and children&#44; and I trust when you<lb/> have time&#44; you will let me hear from<lb/> you of the welfare of yourself and family&#44;<lb/> and I remain your very sincere friend<lb/></p>
            <p>M. M. Allens<lb/></p>
            <p>Do you ever think of making a visit<lb/> to your native land&#63;  <sic>if</sic> so we should<lb/> be very glad to welcome you if you would<lb/> stop and pay us a visit.<lb/></p>
