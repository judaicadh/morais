            <p>a funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear hearers&#33;  My position at this moment is not unlike<lb/> that of a Hebrew Sage&#44; greatly renowned among the ancients.<lb/>  For&#44; as He exhibited a spirit of joyousness&#44; while accompa&#45;<lb/>&#45;nied by friends bent with grief&#44; so do I feel calm and<lb/> serene&#44; though I behold familiar faces bedewed with tears.<lb/>  But why&#63;  Has the frequent witnessing of these melan&#45;<lb/>&#45;choly scenes&#44; blunted the pain that they are wont to create produce&#63;<lb/>  Or&#44; am I&#44; only in the present instance&#44; unaffected by the voice<lb/> of lament&#63;  No&#44; no&#44; the sorrow which oppresses my<lb/> fellow&#45;man&#44; opens always afresh within my breast a stream<lb/> of sympathy.  And unto you&#44; my bereaved friends&#44; unto you&#44;<lb/> that fondly loved him&#44; upon whom you will never look again<lb/> on earth&#44; I now sincerely offer words of condolence.<lb/></p>
            <p>Grievous is indeed this terrestrial separation&#44; and I pray that<lb/> you may bow resignedly to the Divine decree.  Yet&#44; like<lb/> Rabbi Akib&#225;h&#44; whom the sight of the ruins of the Temple&#44;<lb/> filled with gladness&#44; so I also draw from the Book of am I despite this prevailing gloom&#44;<lb/> inspired with buoyant feelings.  For as he was encouraged<lb/> by his firm belief in the consoling promises of our prophets&#44;<lb/> so I also draw from the book of truth that occasion for joy.<lb/>  Ayes&#44; my dear hearers&#33;  I believe that the brother<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>whose decease you deplore&#44; is being led by angels into the<lb/> presence of his heavenly Maker.  Do you wish to learn<lb/> their names&#63;  They are called &#34;charity and compassion.&#34;<lb/>  They are his advocates at the august tribunal of the Most<lb/> High.  They entreat for pardon and obtain it.  They turn<lb/> away wrath&#44; and propitiate Divine grace.  Happy<lb/> was the thought which incited thee&#44; o our departed friend&#33;<lb/> to bestow on the needy a portion of thy wealth&#44; for&#44; thou<lb/> didst thus acquire an indefensible title to the salvation of<lb/> the Almighty &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;He that favoreth<lb/> the poor&#44; lendeth to the Lord&#44; and his reward shall be paid unto<lb/> him.&#34;  And it is also written &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; Because &#34;he hath dispensed&#44; given to the necessitous&#44;<lb/> &#40;therefore&#41; shall the &#40;fruit of&#41; his righteousness endure for ever&#44;<lb/> He shall be greatly exalted in glory.&#34;  Can I then despond&#44;<lb/> when I know that on the eve of bidding this earth world and<lb/> all its fleeting pleasures a lasting farewell&#44; our brother entrusted<lb/> his safety in the hands of charity&#63;  No&#44; he shall be guided<lb/> to happiness.  The united prayer of many whom he<lb/> will have benefitted abroad pave his way to that goal.  The desti&#45;<lb/>&#45;tute and the sick&#44; the orphans and the widows&#44; those whose<lb/> sorrow he will have alleviated&#44; ask of God that to spare the soul<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>of him that has pitied them&#59; to welcome him in heaven&#44;<lb/> that has received in kindness the suffering creatures of the<lb/> earth.  For&#44; the hand now palsied in death&#44; was ever<lb/> stretched forth to help the unfortunate&#44; and to him I must<lb/> ascribe the honor of having given strength to an institution<lb/> ill&#45;supported heretofore by the community at large.<lb/></p>
            <p>His patronage proved a stay to the Jewish Foster&#45;&#45;home<lb/> of Philadelphia.  And as long as that noble charity<lb/> shall continue to furnish society with men and women<lb/> of the humble classes morally trained and educated&#44; so long&#44;<lb/> will the memory of Daniel Gans be a blessing.<lb/></p>
            <p>Such are the means by which he endeavoured to make peace<lb/> with his God&#44; and my faith in Holy Writ is my<lb/> assurance that he did succeed.  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;he that<lb/> soeth charity&#44; hath a true reward.&#34;  That our departed<lb/> brother has often sinned&#44; its not improbable&#44; that he may<lb/> at times have swerved from the laws of nature and revelation&#44; we may easily<lb/> conceive&#44; when we bear in mind how manifold are the allure&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments in the days of youth&#44; the seductions in a state of affluence&#44;<lb/> especially without in the absence of a gentle admonisher&#44; and genial companion&#44;<lb/> and with a disposition to social mirth and convivality.<lb/>  But though imperfect&#45;&#45;and who but God is faultless&#63;&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>though imperfect&#44; I hold up our late friend to you all<lb/> as a worthy exemplar.  Copy his charitable deeds.  Let<lb/> the poor participate in the riches which a kindly<lb/> Providence has granted you.  Be an efficient support to the<lb/> excellent association existing in our midst.  And when&#44;<lb/> like Daniel Gans&#44; you feel that your Father in heaven<lb/> desires that you change this transient existence for one of<lb/> eternity&#44; remember your brethren&#44; the needy and the<lb/> hapless in your land.  Then will your righteousness precede<lb/> you to the abode of the blessed&#59; the glory of the Lord shall<lb/> be your reward.<lb/></p>
