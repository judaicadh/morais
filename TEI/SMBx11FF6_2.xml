            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>I have no prayer to offer&#44; nor eulogy to pronounce&#44;<lb/> but I have thanks warm and deep felt to give.  Why<lb/> should I pray for the salvation of the soul of this young<lb/> brother of ours&#63;  To doubt that he is already imparadised<lb/> in happiness would be to deny Eternal Justice&#59; to gain&#45;<lb/>&#45;say all of which reason and Holy Writ assure us concern&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing the loving&#45;kindness and tender&#45;mercies of a universal<lb/> Parent.  Could He have destined a life which&#44; Alas&#33; proved<lb/> so short and painful&#44; to a hereafter of greater sufferings&#63;<lb/>  Far be from me&#44; far be from any of you&#44; fellow Israe&#45;<lb/>&#45;lites&#44; that blasphemous thought.  Mitchel Sloog<lb/> doubtless may have committed sins&#45;&#45;and he would have been more<lb/> than earthly had he always remained stainless&#44; but his short&#45;<lb/>&#45;comings proceeded in the main&#44; from high spiritedness and did not proceed<lb/> not from an open contempt of the Law&#33;  In his eagerness to earn an become<lb/> in self dependent and earn a sufficiency&#44; livelihood&#44; he may have neglected&#44; at times&#44; some of the<lb/> rules binding upon Israelites&#44; but I&#44; who knew him well&#44;<lb/> believe that his deeds were not misdeeds of rebellion.<lb/>  His heart beat with love for his religion and his God.<lb/>  As I confide in the goodness of the Adorable Lord&#44; I bear within<lb/> me a moral certainty that my young brother needs not my<lb/> supplications for the salvation of his soul.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I have no eulogy to pronounce&#44; because funeral<lb/> panegyrics must aim to reach a twofold object.  First&#44;<lb/> and foremost they must liking comfort to the surviving<lb/> relatives of the deceased.  Hearing that he whose departure<lb/> they lament&#44; receives a due acknowledgment of the virtues<lb/> which adorned his character&#44; they will experience a melancholy<lb/> satisfaction.  And this allays in part the poignant grief<lb/> at the an irreparable loss sustained.  Secondly&#44; panegyrics must tend to<lb/> improve those near and n dear to the dead person.  The reci&#45;<lb/>&#45;tal of his excellencies must arouse a feelings of emulation<lb/> among individuals of the same blood&#44; and a strong desire to<lb/> perpetuate on earth the good qualities&#44; which will have<lb/> won for the departed a commensurate reward in heaven.<lb/>  But a decree which we dare not question&#45;&#45;so shortsighted and<lb/> ignorant as we are&#45;&#45;deprived Mitchel Sloog of all relatives<lb/> of consanguinity.  Father and mother had early preceded<lb/> the unhappy to boy to the land of spirits.  Other branches<lb/> of the parental household were soon cut off&#44; and I shall<lb/> not add to the anguish of his friends&#44; distress myself by recalling the un&#45;<lb/>&#45;natural and two years ago of his only brother.<lb/></p>
            <p>But though neither supplications nor commendations will<lb/> issue from my lips&#44; I have thanks deep and most sincere.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>My thanks are given in the name of Humanity&#44; which<lb/> is the three parts of the Law.  My thanks are due to the<lb/> Philadelphia institution&#44; which did not permit the orphan<lb/> child to be lost to an outcast in a civilized community.  You know that<lb/> I speak of the Foster&#45;Home&#44; which some noble hearted women<lb/> of our people planned&#44; and which has gradually enlisted the<lb/> feelings&#44; personal exertions and liberal donations of very many<lb/> of our brothers and sisters in faith.  In that home Mitchel<lb/> Sloog found a shelter and obtained support and education.<lb/>  So when he grew to an age which necessitated his leaving that<lb/> institute&#44; he could be placed where his worth as an honest and<lb/> industrious lad was fully recognized.  I feel grateful to the Asylum&#44;<lb/> its patrons and directors.  But warmer still are my thanks<lb/> to those among his coevals coreligionists&#44; who proved <sic>stanch</sic> friends&#45;&#45;a posses&#45;<lb/>&#45;sion which the departed young Israelite infinitely valued.  Those friends<lb/> endeavoured to cure mitigate his ailments sufferings&#59; they administered to his wants&#44; smooth&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed his aching pillow&#44; watched over waited upon him at all hours&#44; and&#44; with a self&#45;<lb/>denial deserving of all praise eternal remembrance&#44; watched his departing breath&#44;<lb/> and spent over his remains sleepless nights.<lb/></p>
            <p>I trust that it will not be deemed invidious to make spe&#45;<lb/>&#45;cial mention of two who bestowed on Mitchel Sloog pa&#45;<lb/>rental affection&#44; and with n disinterestedly tried to ease the inevitable agony<lb/> of too early a death.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I mean&#44; Mr and Mrs Polano&#44; in whose house<lb/> the youth found a real home&#44; surrounded with com&#45;<lb/>&#45;forts&#44; and where a change of circumstances brought<lb/> no change of treatment&#44; but on the contrary&#44; intensified<lb/> a wish longing disposition to anticipate the wishes of the ailing one.  It is not for me to say<lb/> how the Lord who delights in mercy will reward all those who<lb/> have nobly exercised that virtue.  The consciousness of having<lb/> done good right&#44; however is in itself a remuneration prize&#44; in comparison to which rubies can&#45; lose<lb/>&#45;not all their value.  But as a servant of that religion which<lb/> recommends kindness promises blessings to the kind&#45;hearted&#44; I ask all who<lb/> have done Mitchel Sloog good to look for the appro&#45;<lb/>&#45;val and favors of their Maker and God.<lb/></p>
            <p>And now we are about to deliver to mother earth what<lb/> belongs thereunto.  We may regret that society has been<lb/> deprived so soon of one a member who might have reflected upon<lb/> it lasting credit&#44; and with the sages of old&#44; we may cry&#44;<lb/> &#34;weep for the losers and not fore the loss&#34;&#44; but we should<lb/> become reconciled to his the absence on of Mitchell upon earth&#44; certain that<lb/> he is already beatified in heaven.<lb/></p>
