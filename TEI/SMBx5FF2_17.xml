            <p>Phila. April 30&#44; 1889<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. Dr. B. Felsenthal<lb/>
                My Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>The same promptness you have exhibited&#44; is now gladly copied by one<lb/> who holds you in high estimation for your genuine learning&#44; but still more for<lb/> your acknowledged modesty.  I spoke of you to the venerable Rabbi Mortara of<lb/> Mantua&#44; as one of the very few in America with whom I differ on theological<lb/> points&#44; but whom I consider honest.  Believe when I say that your approval of<lb/> my recent writings was a comfort&#44;&#45;&#45;so troubled have I been at knowing that<lb/> the object I had in view could not be accomplished.  I am really grieved at the<lb/> thought that Judaism will henceforth take the shape in our midst&#44; which is being<lb/> given it in Cincinnati.  Philadelphia is lethargic by nature&#44; and I am not the<lb/> man who possesses the power to waken her up.  New York might do much&#44; but private<lb/> jealousies are at work&#44; and they militate against joint action.  I know very little<lb/> of Baltimore.  I hear that the Jewish inhabitants are given to conservativism&#44; but<lb/> it does not follow that they are public spirited and sufficiently intelligent to<lb/> realize the necessity of counteracting the ill effects of Dr. W&#39;s teaching.<lb/>  Dr. Szold is all right&#44; so I judge&#44; from my slight acquaintance with him.  If<lb/> your proposition could be carried out&#44; he might answer our purpose as Talmudical<lb/> professor.  But you readily understand how essential the establishing of a school&#44;<lb/> I care nothing for names&#44; call it a college&#44; a University&#44; whatever people like best&#45;&#45;<lb/> where the Rabbi&#44; in its grammatical&#44; philological&#44; and principally and in its spirit&#44; is&#44;<lb/> in order to raise right preceptors for the next generation.  A chair in a secular<lb/> university&#44; would not suffice&#44; nor could a non&#45;Jewish professor impart all we want.<lb/>  Such are my views&#44; but however I may set them forth before my immediate cong&#59; or<lb/> before the public they yield no benefit.  Schools&#44; so termed <hi rend="underline">religious</hi> schools&#44;<lb/> exist in America everywhere&#44; but ask a youth to read and translate understandingly<lb/> a chapter of the <sic>Schriptures</sic>&#44; and you will soon form a criterion of the amount<lb/> of learning in the Hebrew Community of the U. S. &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>I am glad that you received all that has been published of Luzzatto&#39;s<lb/> correspondence.  His son contemplates proceeding with it&#44; and to make it cheaper<lb/> he designs using Rabbinical characters.  He asked my advice&#44; but I am ashamed to<lb/> say I neglected replying.  Owing to the little encouragement which the first<lb/> publication has met with&#44; I begin to doubt that we shall soon be favored with a<lb/> continuation&#44; though Dr. Luz&#39;s filial reverence may induce him to go on&#44; even in<lb/> the face of an almost sure loss.  I don&#39;t have any copy of the Pentateuch for sale&#44;<lb/> but if you wish I will write to Padera&#44; and you will have it sent to your direction<lb/> without delay.  Its price&#44; I believe&#44; will be from three to four dollars.<lb/></p>
            <p>With kind regards&#44; I am<lb/>
                Yours sincerely&#44;<lb/>
                S. MORAIS<lb/></p>
