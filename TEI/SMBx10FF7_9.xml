            <p>Brethren.  As a Hebrew among a gathering of fel&#45;<lb/>&#45;low&#45;believers&#44; my presence in this sacred building<lb/> has no significance.  As the exponent of a prin&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciple before a religious body&#44; that bears the im&#45;<lb/>&#45;press of honorable age&#44; my ascending this pulpit<lb/> conveys a deep meaning.  It tells my people&#44;<lb/> that a number of the faithful&#44; whose record<lb/> oepns the first pages of Jewish history in the<lb/> empire state of America&#44; are alive to the duty<lb/> which the favored ones owe the unfortunates.<lb/>  Far from rising upon the shoulders of the lofty in social&#45;<lb/>by lofty station&#44; who gave origin to this congregation&#44; and<lb/> looking down from that height upon the lowly&#44;<lb/> the free and respected bend to hear the cry of<lb/> brethren shackled and degraded by iniquity.<lb/>  To solace grief and to deliver is the wish of<lb/> this &#34;remnant of Israel&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> They that are called &#34;Shearith Israel&#34; will not<lb/> do wrong&#44;&#34; wrote a man whose pen was dipped<lb/> in inspiration.  It is because you design to do<lb/> right&#44; that you have now set for me a<lb/></p>

            <p>conspicuous place in your assembly.<lb/>  I have overcome a natural reluctance against<lb/> venturing beyond the immediate sphere of my<lb/> workings labors&#44; and have accepted your invitation.<lb/>  The thought that through my means you<lb/> would assume the lead in a cooperative under&#45;<lb/>&#45;taking of philanthropy&#44; inspired me with<lb/> confidence.<lb/></p>
            <p>I shall not be misunderstood&#44; when I say that we&#44; who are Sephardic by lineal descent<lb/> or by adoption&#44; must justify our pride in<lb/> the pioneers of Judaism in this Western Con&#45;<lb/>&#45;tinent.  The names of the estimable dead<lb/> borne with a prayer upon the lips of the<lb/> officiating minister on the holiest night<lb/> of our year&#44; will best be embalmed in our memory&#44;<lb/> by our reproducing deeds which recall the in&#45;<lb/>&#45;tegrity of merchants&#44; the culture of individuals&#44;<lb/> the fidelity of Jews.  Had we even<lb/> legitimate&#45; reasons to claim superiority over the Ashkenazic<lb/> branch of our people&#44; we should not dare<lb/> copy the Bordeaux Isarelites of last century.<lb/></p>

            <p>They blackened with an ineffaceable spot<lb/> the bright pages of an&#45;&#45;otherwise&#45;&#45;admirable book.<lb/>  In the polemic volume credited to &#34;certain<lb/> Jews&#34;&#44; but emanating chiefly from the distin&#45;<lb/>&#45;guished French Abbot Guen&#233;c&#44; the few ini&#45;<lb/>&#45;tial letters of a series&#44; genuinely addressed by<lb/> Portuguese Israelites to Voltaire&#44; offend our sense<lb/> of Hebrew solidarity.  We cannot contemplate<lb/> without blushing the odious line of demarcation<lb/> drawn there by the writers&#44; between Hebrews<lb/> whose ancestors shed lustre on the Iberian pe&#45;<lb/>&#45;ninsula&#44; and those who were reviled in Teutonic<lb/> lands.  We do glory in our prede&#45;<lb/>&#45;cessors who laid the foundation stone of Jewish<lb/> progress&#44; religious and beneficial&#44; wherever they<lb/> took up their abode&#44; but our boast must be<lb/> supported by the rank we shall have at&#45;<lb/>&#45;tained in all which leads to human eleva&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion.  To that end we must vie with sister<lb/> congregations.  The opportunity is offered.<lb/>  A society which has embodied the principle<lb/> underlying our faith&#45;&#45;a principle which<lb/> has vitalized our existence&#45;&#45;&#44; the principle&#44;<lb/> I say&#44; of a reciprocal striving after the<lb/> common weal&#59; the principle which our<lb/> Sages have concisely taught in their ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;xim &#34;Israelites are guarantees for one ano&#45;<lb/>&#45;ther&#34;&#44; that society whose motto is the same<lb/> Rabbinical app aphorism &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> seeks our countenances&#44; our fraternal aid.<lb/></p>

            <p>&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42;<lb/></p>
            <p>Gentlemen.  A few explanatory words will not<lb/> be taken amiss.  When I first read the circular<lb/> inviting me to this Conference&#44; I deemed my<lb/> presence unnecessary.  Having never har&#45;<lb/>&#45;bored ill&#45;will hatred against my fellow&#45;man&#44; whose<lb/> views differ from mine&#44; I thought it super&#45;<lb/>&#45;fluous to come here with no definite object&#44;<lb/> save to show signs of &#34;brotherly feelings&#44;&#34; by<lb/> a friendly pressure of the hand.  Hence&#44; my<lb/> original declination.  Soon after&#44; however&#44;<lb/> I reflected that though my presence was not<lb/> in reality needed&#44; my absence might be<lb/> misconstrued.  The community of our people<lb/> would accept as a foregone conclusion&#44; that per&#45;<lb/>&#45;sons of my turn of mind designedly keep aloof<lb/> from others.  My Philadelphia colleagues<lb/> could clear me of that imputation&#44; still&#44; I<lb/> fancied that I owed it to the cause lying near<lb/> my heart to disprove the charge&#44; by putting<lb/> in an appearance.  Accordingly&#44; I resolved<lb/> to come and listen.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>But subsequently to my having notified<lb/> your Reverend secretary of my intention&#44; he asked<lb/> that I would prepare a paper and read it<lb/> in your presence.  I confess&#44; I was disconcerted.<lb/>  The rules which govern this body&#44; and which<lb/> were sent to me with the circular&#44; sounded like<lb/> a warning against touching upon a single point<lb/> allusive&#44; even remotely&#44; to &#34;Congregational autonomy&#44;&#34;<lb/> and&#44; as I understood that clause&#44; it forbids my<lb/> discussing questions which have set synagogues<lb/> widely apart.  I then asked myself&#58; &#34;Must<lb/> I deal in glittering generalities&#44; so as not to be<lb/> taxed with intrusion&#63;&#34;  In my perplexity&#44;<lb/> I had recourse again to your Secretary&#44; and learned<lb/> that a number of practical subjects&#44; which he<lb/> kindly named&#44; might meet with your acceptance.<lb/>  I considered those topics well&#44; but despite my<lb/> endeavours to avoid whatever might clash with<lb/> the Constitution of the &#34;Jewish Ministers&#39; Association&#44;&#34;<lb/> my <sic>idiosyncracy</sic>&#45;&#45;so to term it&#45;&#45;would cross<lb/> out.  To treat upon &#34;the Hebrew&#45;language&#44;&#34;<lb/> or &#34;the aspiration of the/ Hebrews&#34; and or any of the kindred<lb/></p>

            <p>themes as suggested&#44; and not exhibit decided<lb/> feelings relative to &#34;Congregational Autonomy&#44;&#34;<lb/> would have been to do my nature violence.<lb/>  While I acknowledge myself beholden to your<lb/> secretary for his courtesy&#44; I nevertheless chose to prepared<lb/> a paper not savoring in the least of theology.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Universal Alliance Isra&#233;lite Alliance Universelle&#44; has<lb/> engaged my thoughts&#44; and to my remarks con&#45;<lb/>&#45;cerning it&#44; I crave your attention.<lb/></p>
            <p>If there be one central point toward which all<lb/> our views converge&#44; it is that which looks to a<lb/> systematic training of Jewish youths.  By an<lb/> error&#44; which cannot be too deeply lamented&#44; a<lb/> Rabbinical sentence has been made a clog<lb/> in the wheel of educational progress.  The<lb/> sentence which awards the highest merit to the<lb/> stuy of the Talmud&#44;&#45;&#45;a pity saying which<lb/> our incomparable Rashi elucidated&#45;&#45;&#44; has<lb/> shrouded our schools in mental darkness.<lb/>  Those who hear me have read the noble utterances<lb/> of Hertz Wessely&#44; the contemporary and coworker<lb/></p>

            <p>of Moses Mendelssohn.  That splendid ripe<lb/> scholar complained of the unmethodical rude method<lb/> course pursued then by teachers in Poland and<lb/> Germany.  A sensible familiarity with the<lb/> Bible&#44; which ought to lie at the basis of<lb/> <sic>of</sic> all Jewish learning&#44; was discarded&#44; and the<lb/> minds of our children were befogged with hair&#45;<lb/>splitting disputations on matters of no practical<lb/> use.  Imbued with the idea that to pore<lb/> over the pages of the Babylonian Gemara&#44; is<lb/> most meritorious&#44; our offspring ended in deeming<lb/> every other study trifling in comparison with<lb/> it.  Thus a total neglect of secular knowledge&#44;<lb/> exposed us to contempt.  Against a course so<lb/> hurtful to our social elevation&#44; Wessely re&#45;<lb/>&#45;monstrated&#44; but the great Hebraist was partly<lb/> mistaken&#44; when he gave Israelites in African<lb/> and Asiatic countries credit for a higher grade<lb/> of culture.  His misapprehension may have<lb/> arisen from the circumstance that during his<lb/> stay in Amsterdam&#44; he met Oriental Jews&#44; con&#45;<lb/>&#45;siderably versed in Holy Writ&#44; and speaking a passably<lb/></p>

            <p>good Spanish or Arabic.  Had the whole&#45;<lb/>souled Jew of Hamburg travelled journeyed much fur&#45;<lb/>ther south beyond the Netherlands&#44; he would<lb/> have been grieved to the core on seeing the<lb/> glaringly defective manner of training our<lb/> youths.  Thus&#44; by way of illustration&#44; our Hertz<lb/> Wessely would have discovered how in the land<lb/> where Rabbi Hushiel of the tenth century<lb/> was Providentially taken&#44; after having been cap&#45;<lb/>&#45;tured by pirates with his three famous fellow&#45;<sic>tra&#45;<lb/>&#45;vellers</sic>; how in the land where Hannanel&#44; still more<lb/> noted than his own father Hushiel&#44; wrote learned com&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments&#59; in the land&#44; I say&#44; which gave us a Ben Karish<lb/> the philologist&#44; a Chayny the grammarian&#44; an<lb/> Alfasi the theologian&#44; our fellow&#45;believers&#44; are&#44;<lb/> as a body&#44; devoid of even a purely correct under&#45;<lb/>standing of the Scriptures.  Doubtless&#44; the crushing<lb/> tyranny which unmans the Jew in the Barbary<lb/> states&#44; prevents him from detecting  his own<lb/> <sic>deffiecencies</sic>&#44; but need I explain to my<lb/> hearers to what extent that literary depression&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>adds to a social and political oppression&#63;<lb/>  &#34;Under Edom and not under Ishmael&#44;&#34; is a<lb/> Rabbinical adage applicable to our down&#45;trodden<lb/> coreligionists in many a benighted Mohammedan<lb/> region&#59; yet&#44; I firmly believe that the fetters which<lb/> the gentle hands of a veritable philanthropist<lb/> could not loosen&#44; will be finally broken at length by the powerful<lb/> agency of education.<lb/></p>
            <p>To the Universal Alliance Isra&#233;lite Universelle Alliance is due the glory is<lb/> due of having bravely undertaken a herculean task.<lb/>  Semipolitical in seeking to redress our wrongs&#45;&#45;<lb/>the bitter injuries inflicted on our race&#59; effectively<lb/> beneficial in lessing lessening Israel&#39;s sorrows and suffering by<lb/> temporary timely relief&#44; still&#44; the chief and ever steady<lb/> aim of that all&#45;embracing association is the elevation<lb/> of the coheirs of our Divine the written and oral Law&#44; by means of tea&#45;<lb/>&#45;chings that widen the range of thoughts&#44; and create<lb/> noble ambitions.  The Alliance cannot say to<lb/> our brethren&#44; who are <sic>levelled</sic> with the earth&#44; &#34;rise and<lb/> strike for your rights&#34;; but it does say to a people<lb/> that walk in darkness&#44; &#34;I set a light before you&#44; direct<lb/> your vision to it and you will finally issue forth from<lb/></p>

            <p>your abject obscurity.&#34;  To facilitate that happy<lb/> result&#44; men who feel and think have lent their<lb/> far&#45;reaching influence&#44; and poured out gold without<lb/> stint.  It is not invidious to mention Baron<lb/> De Hirsch&#44; who&#44; nine years ago&#44; laid into the treasury<lb/> of the Alliance one million francs to establish schools in the Orient&#44; and who&#44; never has never since that<lb/> period has never withheld his munificent gifts&#44; dispensed<lb/> by his largewide&#45;hearted and almost ubiquitous almoner&#44;<lb/> Chevalier Veneziani.  It is not invidious to single<lb/> out that benefactor&#44; because all will agree that<lb/> his liberality is indeed royally exceptionally but exceptionally royal.<lb/>  But were it my purpose to praise Israelites who stood<lb/> by the Alliance in its refirmatory work&#44; who defend&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed it against aspersions&#44; who gave it a name<lb/> unparalleled in the annals of Jewish Charities&#44; I<lb/> could array in your presence a galaxy of distin&#45;<lb/>&#45;guished brethren in France&#44; in Germany&#44; in Italy&#44;<lb/> in Asia Minor&#44; in many climes of the old world&#44;<lb/> so that you might remember them to do them<lb/> honor.

            <p>The Association in whose the interest of which I am privileged<lb/> to address men&#44; who can bring to bear upon it a<lb/> mighty influence&#44; has opened a channel through<lb/> which the cries of the afflicted reach the ears<lb/> of deliverers.  I do do not mean to detract from<lb/> the merits worth of the Board of Deputies in England&#44; nor<lb/> nor from those of to disparage the merits the Board of Delegates in Ame&#45;<lb/>&#45;rica.  Those organizations did measurably<lb/> help in a measure&#44; but I venture to assert&#44; without fear of<lb/> contradiction&#44; that to the representative body of Jews<lb/> who met in Paris for the first time when stirred by the Mortara heart&#45;ren&#45;<lb/>&#45;volting rending Mortara outrage outrage&#44; vast superiority is due.<lb/>  L&#39;Alliance Isra&#233;lite Universelle made the<lb/> capital of France in 1860 two years after the horrid deed at Bologna&#44; the &#91;&#63;&#93; depository of every<lb/> day&#39;s history in the political and social life<lb/> of scattered Israel.  Those records are not placed<lb/> there as curiosities&#44; to be consulted by coming<lb/></p>

No&#58; they have a speech<lb/> commanding action&#44; immediate&#44; and energetic.<lb/>  A Russo&#45;Turkish war spreads desolation<lb/> among our people&#44;&#45;&#45;the Alliance in Paris<lb/> hears the groans and hastens to the rescue.<lb/>  A pestilence rages in Morocco&#44;&#45;&#45;the Alliance<lb/> provides healing for the sick&#44; food to stay<lb/> off famine.  Does a fire break out at Constan&#45;<lb/>&#45;tinople&#63;  The Alliance shelters the homeless.<lb/>  Does the ferocious Bear at St Petersburg thrusts<lb/> its fang claws into the sides of powerless Jews&#63;<lb/>  The alliance seeks protection for those affrighted creatures who can<lb/> hide away from the terrific talons.  The<lb/> Alliance remonstrates against the tyranny<lb/> which robs the descendants of <sic>heros</sic> and sages of<lb/> human dignity.  It sets forth their claims to the<lb/> right of citizenship&#59; it keeps the question of our<lb/> emancipation in constant agitation&#44; to the<lb/> vexation of despots&#44; but to the ultimate weal<lb/> of down trodden Hebrews.<lb/></p>

            <p>power of the Alliance.  For in an untram&#45;<lb/>&#45;melled system of instruction&#44; it has discovered the<lb/> lever of Jewish exaltation.  Very nigh ten<lb/> thousand are under its fostering care.  When<lb/> the boy who wears out his tender years in<lb/> the wearisome and profitless exercise of learning<lb/> how to sing a chapter of the Scriptures&#44; shall<lb/> have gained an insight into the Spirit of the<lb/> Law&#44; when the refining influences of a general<lb/> knowledge shall have drawn him out of his<lb/> narrow self into a newly generated being&#44;<lb/> his manhood will assert itself and compel<lb/> respect.  When the girl&#44; whose the summary<lb/> of whose duties lies in entering a wedded life before<lb/> she buds into womanhood&#45;&#45;out of obedience to<lb/> the un<sic>yeilding</sic> will of unwise parents&#45;&#45;&#44; will have<lb/> acquired a taste for reading&#44; and the capacity to<lb/> become self&#45;dependent by dint of industry&#44; then<lb/> the wives and mothers in our race&#44; will fittingly<lb/> occupy their God&#45;appointed stations.<lb/>  Without overlooking closing its eyes against the misery &#91;&#63;&#93; always looming high up in<lb/> the Occident&#44; the Alliance<lb/> stretches its eager vision to the Orient.<lb/></p>

            <p>It commissions its apostles&#44; and they go forth<lb/> preaching education&#59; they plant schools for<lb/> males and females in countries where the Jew is the<lb/> pariah of society&#44; where with naked feet he<lb/> must tread the ground owned by Islam&#44; where<lb/> with bleeding hands he must perform the<lb/> most menial and abhorrent offices.  The<lb/> Alliance urges the outcasts of our people to vin&#45;<lb/>&#45;dicate their characters from the charge of<lb/> sloth by arming themselves with agricultural<lb/> instruments&#44; and furrowing the soil with sinewy<lb/> vigour.  The Alliance encourages awakens love for mechanical<lb/> arts&#44; and rewards the endeavours of the la&#45;<lb/>&#45;borer&#44; to make him that he shall feel the truth enunciated<lb/> by the Talmudists&#58; &#34;Great is work&#44; for it<lb/> honors him that does it&#34;.<lb/></p>
