            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            
            <p>The day and the time bid me be brief.  Could I detain<lb/> you more than a few moments&#44; I would relate at some<lb/> length a history which this coffin recalls to memory.<lb/>  For the thought that she who is enshrouded herein<lb/> had once been the occupant of a house in the rear of<lb/> a synagogue in Cherry st&#44; awakens within me old<lb/> reminiscences.  Do we not all delight mentally to<lb/> travel back on the ways we trod in the remote past&#63;<lb/>  As I stand over the remains of this Jewess&#44; I fancy<lb/> that it was but yesterday when on the 17th of March<lb/> 1837&#44; I first met my venerable sister in faith.<lb/>  I was hungry and she gave me to eat&#59; I was<lb/> a stranger painfully timid&#44; and she made me<lb/> welcome.  The first house in which I broke<lb/> bread in Philadelphia was that of which she Sarah<lb/> was Israel was the mistress.  The first place in which I made<lb/> my devotions in Philadelphia was a room in the<lb/> same house.  For there I read privately recited the afternoon service<lb/> of the fast&#44; before entering the Synagogue on the<lb/> eve of Purim to hear the book of Esther read<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>by an aspirant to the office&#44; which I<lb/> have held since the following April of that year.  I can<lb/> never forget that meeting &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; nor others of frequent<lb/> occurrence.  For during the eleven months that<lb/> her plain spoken but thoroughly honest husband<lb/> lived&#44; after my arrival&#44; to keep the position<lb/> of sexton&#44; I often entered her dwelling.  Upon<lb/> each Friday morning&#44; when I habitually visited<lb/> her after having rehearsed&#44; in the adjoining Syna&#45;<lb/>&#45;gogue&#44; the portion of the Law for the coming<lb/> Sabbath&#44; she invariably showed me tokens of<lb/> friendly hospitality.  Indeed among the praise&#45;<lb/>&#45;worthy trials traits of her character&#44; that parti&#45;<lb/>&#45;cularly shone with conspicuity&#59; and I desire<lb/> to lay this wealth which memory has woven<lb/> over this coffin.  May it be acceptable<lb/> to her who is now imparadised among the Sages<lb/> of our people&#44; that declared the exercise of the<lb/> virtue of hospitality&#44; one that is rewarded<lb/> here and hereafter.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am not given to superstition&#44; and I think it<lb/> a sin against the Law of Moses which warns<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>us not to be observers of times&#44; to look upon<lb/> the day of burial as inauspicious or propitious&#44;<lb/> but I cannot hold back an feeling idea which tells<lb/> me that if Sarah Israel had been asked to choose<lb/> the time for her interment&#44; she would have selected<lb/> this&#44;&#45;&#45;the eve of the day of great pardon.  for<lb/> in the God who ordered it as means of reconciliation<lb/> between His Israel His missionary people&#44; and Himself&#44; our departed sis&#45;<lb/>&#45;ter in faith believed with all her heart&#44; with all<lb/> her soul and with her might.  Never since I have known her did<lb/> she depart from His precepts&#44; and as far as the<lb/> limited knowledge of acquaintance with the Law and traditions which<lb/> she possessed allowed her&#44; she defended her<lb/> religion from the aspersions of scoffers.  Her pure<lb/> spirit must feel the truth of the Scriptures&#44; that<lb/> because she had considered the Lord the portion<lb/> of her inheritance&#44; therefore her lots have fallen<lb/> unto her in pleasant regions.  I do not<lb/> have a tear nor a regret by reason of my friend&#39;s<lb/> departure&#59; for our venerable coreligionist lived to<lb/> a far advanced age&#44; loved and respected&#44; and with&#45;<lb/>&#45;out undergoing many a sore trial which others too frequently endured.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>But I am pained by reason of her daughter.<lb/>  To her the loss is very great&#44; just because<lb/> to wait upon her old mother&#44; to anticipate her<lb/> pleasures&#44; to watch over her&#44; and smooth her pillow<lb/> was a grateful occupation.  We ha who have<lb/> gathered to do the deceased honor&#44; cannot restore<lb/> to the bereaved one her mother dear parent&#44; but we assure<lb/> her of our sympathies.  May she be comforted<lb/> in the reflection that she performed her duty<lb/> nobly.  May she be consoled in the belief<lb/> that the recipient of her filial devotedness<lb/> blesses smiles on her&#44; and prays to God that He may<lb/> shower down consolations choice blessings upon her Martha.<lb/>  And now let us beseech the Lord of forgiveness to<lb/> scatter away the clouds of sin which may stand<lb/> in the way of her our sister&#39;s translation to the realms<lb/> of bliss&#44; and that her good qualities may<lb/> be angels conveying her soul to the habitation<lb/> of eternal bliss beatitude and unending joys.<lb/>  Amen.<lb/></p>
