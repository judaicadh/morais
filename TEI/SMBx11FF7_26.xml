            <p>a funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>The Sages of Israel&#44; whose writings on morals exhibit profound<lb/> wisdom&#44; are the authors of the following apothegm.  &#34;He that<lb/> is esteemed by men&#44; is beloved by God.&#34;  But....can it be really<lb/> so&#63;  Does the world honor only the honest and the good&#63;  Do<lb/> we not&#44; on the contrary&#44; see wickedness seated in high places&#63;<lb/>  Falsehood and profligacy stalk abroad&#44; and receive obeisance&#63;<lb/>  Are they indeed&#44; who&#44; by artifice elude detection&#44; and buy public<lb/> applause&#44; those whom the God of justice will imparadise in<lb/> his heavenly embrace&#63;  No&#44; dear Brethren&#33;  Not of such<lb/> did the teachers of our people speak.  The man of birth&#44;<lb/> the opulent&#44; aye&#44; the crafty too may win praise&#59; but<lb/> esteem&#44; that sense of deep appreciation of our worth&#44; that<lb/> encomium ingenuously expressed&#44; and spontaneously bestowed&#44; is<lb/> the halo cast solely round the lives of the virtuous.  They<lb/> will ever be adorned therewith&#44; whose actions upon earth have<lb/> redounded to the benefit of human beings.  Ephemeral<lb/> is fictitious fame.  Like a flower&#44; that charms the eye while<lb/> in bloom&#44; but causes fails to attract when withered&#44; so will the plaudits<lb/> of the worldly be heard no more cease&#44; when wealth and power<lb/> decline.  But virtue&#44; sterling virtue will at all times&#44; challenge<lb/> universal commendation&#44; as it must secure Divine favors.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For&#44; just be as the Rabbins have taught.  &#34;He is that is esteemed<lb/> by man&#44; is beloved by God.&#34;<lb/></p>
                <p>Their reflections&#44; my dear friends&#33; have been suggested by the circum&#45; position<lb/> &#45;stances under in which I now am placed.  Were I to invoke<lb/> my personal knowledge of the deceased brother&#44; in order to becomingly<lb/> pronounce a eulogy&#44; I would discover my utter inadequacy to the<lb/> task.  For&#44; the opportunity of forming more than a slight<lb/> acquaintance&#44; was not offered to me&#44; during his residence in our<lb/> city&#59; yet&#44; I may say&#44; without incurring censure&#44; that Elias Elkus<lb/> Sommers Somers was good and true.  For&#44; the hearts of many among you&#44;<lb/> my hearers&#44; reverberate the sound of those words.  Merchants&#33;<lb/> who knew our lamented brother&#44; when treading the busy marts of<lb/> traffic&#44; lay upon this coffin a testimonial of his high worth.<lb/>  From you have I learnt of his unswerving rectitude&#44; of his scrupulous<lb/> adherence to the rules of equity.  You who have travelled&#93;sic&#33;&#93;<lb/> to the sunny South&#44; and sat at his family board&#44; tell us of his<lb/> hospitality&#59; tell us of his genial and kindly disposition alike<lb/> towards his inferiors&#44; as towards his equals.  For&#44; it was not<lb/> the least&#44; but the most sublime feature in the character of<lb/> Elias Sommers&#44; to yearn and care paternally for the hapless<lb/> beings&#44; whom society placed consigned at that period&#44; under to his absolute<lb/> control.  When apprised of the qualities&#44; which distinguished<lb/></p>

            <p>this sainted Israelite&#44; I could not refuse to become the interpreter<lb/> of your sentiments&#44; my dear Brethren&#33;  I would not demur<lb/> when asked to speak in commendatory terms of one who illustrated<lb/> his religious principles by a correct measure&#44; and a righteous mete&#45;<lb/>&#45;yard.  Of one&#44; whom sympathies were drawn to the object of<lb/> the earth and the forlorn&#44; of one whose evidences of a friendly nature<lb/> were an open house&#44; and a generous heart.  If it be true&#44; as<lb/> the Talmudists assert&#44; that when summoned before the august presence<lb/> of our Judge&#44; we shall be questioned touching our dealings with our<lb/> fellow&#45;mortals&#44; what greetings must he meet above who&#44; by<lb/> common consent&#44; has been emphatically declared an honest man.<lb/>  Not even the stains of unatoned sins&#44; could deny him a seat<lb/> among the blessed&#59; for over them was thrown the broad mantle<lb/> of virtue&#44; which his own hands had woven.  Aye&#44; the<lb/> goodly deeds he performed as a social being&#44; and as a votary<lb/> to Jewish laws ordinances&#44; will propitiate the grace of God&#44; as they gained<lb/> the esteem of man.  Wipe the tearful eyes&#44; thou who<lb/> did long share his joy and his trials.  Had he who has reached<lb/> the shores of eternity&#44; bequeathed to thee a legacy of blood<lb/> and revenge&#59; thou mightest then weep and moan&#44; thou<lb/> mightest bewail the doom awaiting his soul.  But charity<lb/> was his last will.  Nay&#44; in the reveries occasioned<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>by a fatal disease&#44; the mind intuitively reverted to that<lb/> upon which it frequently dwelt&#44; and charity was the burden<lb/> of its incoherent thoughts.  The soul thus beneficently<lb/> pervaded&#44; is so celestially happy&#59; and thou canst&#44; my<lb/> gentle friend&#44; enhance its bliss by acts of charity.<lb/>  Go forth with thy wonted smile to do good&#44; and let thy<lb/> serene resignation to the decree of the omnipotent&#44; comfort<lb/> thou especially who have lost in Elias Elkan Summers the<lb/> vigilant guardian of their youth&#44; the man whom thou<lb/> taughtest them to regard as their dearest friend of on earth&#44; as a<lb/> father most affectionate and tender.
