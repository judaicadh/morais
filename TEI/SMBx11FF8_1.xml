            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET.<lb/></p>
            <p>PHILADELPHIA&#44; 189<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>&#34;Let his actions sound his praise.&#34;  So spoke the<lb/> one who loved Lucien Moss most.  I shall respect<lb/> the wish and refrain from pronouncing a eulogy.<lb/>  All know that our coreligionist was public&#45;spirited&#59;<lb/> an expression which in plain language means&#44; that<lb/> he took a lively interest in whatever tends to pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;mote the welfare of the community in whose midst<lb/> he lived.  I could&#44; if I were not prevented by request&#44;<lb/> offer bright illustrations of that truth.  I could&#44;<lb/> for example&#44; show that the Israelite whose sudden<lb/> demise Philadelphia will deplore&#44; is the main&#44;<lb/> whom I met on a winter evening of the year 1869<lb/> at the initial gathering designed to put an end to<lb/> injudicious almsgiving&#59; a gathering aiming to con&#45;<lb/>&#45;solidate disconnected institutions not infrequently<lb/> neutralizing each other&#39;s workings.  I could show<lb/> that Lucien Moss stood sponsor at the inception<lb/> of &#34;The Society of the United Hebrew Charities&#34; and<lb/> that&#44; for a time&#44; did it effective service.  I could<lb/> prove by the testimony of facts that his activity<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>in the field of human benefaction&#44; extended much<lb/> further than among the people whose cardinal<lb/> belief he shared and confessed.  I could prove<lb/> that to allay suffering&#44; to raise the fallen&#44; to<lb/> protect the defenseless&#44; our departed brother united<lb/> with the good of every denomination.  I could demon&#45;<lb/>&#45;strate that the popularity which he deservedly enjoyed&#44;<lb/> was due to his wide sociability&#59; to a total absence<lb/> of pride&#44; which position and opulence are apt to<lb/> engender.  But if in obedience to the injunction<lb/> of her who had a right to command in the present me&#45;<lb/>&#45;lancholy instance&#44; I am debarred from pointing out<lb/> deeds which exemplified the qualities possessed by<lb/> Lucien Moss&#59; if I dare not depict him as a factor<lb/> in the history of organizations&#44; which have greatly<lb/> multiplied since he commenced his useful dealings<lb/> as a citizen and a member of the Jewish community&#44;<lb/> I cannot do violence to my feelings by keeping<lb/> silent about one deed that has elicited my gratitude&#44;<lb/> because I am instinctively drawn to the friendless.<lb/>  To him a dear little girl owes her deliverance from<lb/> a career of vagrancy&#44; perhaps of vice.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>He extended to her almost parental protection.<lb/>  Under an affliction which might have created<lb/> deep mental depression&#44; his kindness cheered and<lb/> inspirited the child.  By constant tokens of<lb/> affectionate consideration&#44; he awakened corresponding<lb/> sentiments&#44; and while acting in conformity with<lb/> the dictates of practical religion&#44; he rendered the<lb/> unhappy happy.  For that I am personally<lb/> thankful.  But as a chosen guardian of the<lb/> honor of Israel&#44; I declare myself indebted to<lb/> Lucien Moss for another favor . He has rolled away<lb/> a reproach from the people to whom I minister.<lb/>  How often has the charge been made against the<lb/> descendants of our Bezalel and Aholiab&#45;&#45;the wise<lb/> hearted&#44; filled with the spirit of God&#44; as the scriptures ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;press it&#44; the men who worked in gold&#44; in silver<lb/> and copper for the erection of the Mosaic Tabernacle&#59;<lb/> how often it has been brought against the progeny<lb/> of the builders and engravers&#44; who&#44; with the Giblin&#44;<lb/> or Giblites&#44; set up the magnificent Solomon Temple&#44;<lb/> how often it has been derisively said that Jewish<lb/> hands fear to soil their dainty fingers with the<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>laborer&#39;s tools.  Lucien Moss gave that charge<lb/> the lie.  He was a machinist by trade and what<lb/> he successfully began in early days&#44; enabled<lb/> him later on to select an occupation that <sic>yeilded</sic><lb/> more than a competence and a name which<lb/> will not die.  I trust that the few lau&#45;<lb/>&#45;datory utterances which I could not hold back&#44;<lb/> will not have offended her who deemed words<lb/> of praise over the remains of her husband&#44; unnecessary.<lb/>  With the chief and saddest mourner&#59; with all<lb/> who are pained by reason of this bereavement&#44; I<lb/> sympathise.  With them I lament the untimely<lb/> departure.  With them I beseech the Creator&#44; who<lb/> called from earth our brother Lucien Moss&#44; to bid<lb/> heavenly consolations rest upon those who cherish his<lb/> memory....Deign O God&#44; to let comforts flow co&#45;<lb/>&#45;piously.  I pray at this solemn hour for the soul<lb/> of the adorer of Thy Unity.  Oh&#33; may Mercy hide his<lb/> trespasses&#44; and disclose his virtues in the sight of the archangels<lb/> who invoke Thy name&#44; as recorded by the seer of old&#44; &#34;Holy<lb/> holy&#44; holy is the Lord of hosts&#34; May the spirit of Thy servant join in the<lb/> Seraphic chorus&#44; and be uplifted thereby where joys abide<lb/> everlastingly.  Amen.<lb/></p>
