            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>

            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>The memory of a dear friend of mine&#44; whom the de&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceased fondly loved&#44; has compelled my compliance<lb/> with his repeated a request which&#44; as I am assured&#44; he repeatedly expressed&#44; I acknowledge that<lb/> on an occasion of comparatively recent date&#44; I re&#45;<lb/>&#45;considered my consent to offer official services un&#45;<lb/>&#45;der a circumstance like the present.  I believed<lb/> then&#44; as I believe now&#44; that I ought not to coun&#45;<lb/>&#45;tenance a departure deviation from a rule&#44; founded on the his&#45;<lb/>&#45;tory of Judaism&#44; which dates and illustrated as far back as in the<lb/> time of Abraham.  For&#44; untrue is the assert&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion that Israelites accepted at any period the Greek<lb/> method of disposing of their dead.  But while my<lb/> mind warned me against the act that I now<lb/> perform&#44; my heart urged me on to it.<lb/></p>
            <p>The high esteem in which I held the woman<lb/> upon whom C.....S......had bestowed all his af&#45;<lb/>&#45;fection&#44; passed was in a measure transferred over to him.  For<lb/> her sake&#44; he showed me and mine tokens of<lb/> kind regards&#44; which I dared not ignore&#44; and which<lb/> would have rendered a refusal&#44; at in this sorrowful<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>instance&#44; ingratitude.  He who was so sud&#45;<lb/>&#45;denly taken hence&#44; wished that I would speak over<lb/> his remains and what as I felt&#44; and that alone will<lb/> I say utter.  I lament his departure because I im&#45;<lb/>&#45;agine myself correct in declaring C.....S......<lb/> a man of sterling integrity.  Without using<lb/> the clerical cant of the cloth&#44; quoting at great length Law<lb/> and traditions&#44; I may appeal to the Sages of our<lb/> people as my authority for saying that the undying<lb/> spirit of this Hebrew now standing before the Almighty<lb/> Judge will be awarded happiness&#44; for&#44; to the question<lb/> put to it&#44; the soul will be able to answer.  &#34;Yea<lb/> O Lord&#33;&#34;  So tell us the Talmudists.  As we<lb/> appear in the presence of God&#44; we will first be<lb/> asked&#58; &#34;Have you dealt honestly with your fellow&#45;<lb/>creatures&#63;&#34;  Not concerning our varied &#91;&#63;&#93; attainments&#59;<lb/> not about our <sic>metaphisical</sic> investigations and<lb/> critical researches&#44; but on the uprightness of our<lb/> dealings&#44; on our probity we shall be interrogated.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have never heard of breath of censure on touching<lb/> the character of my brother Israelite here coffined.  The fa&#45;<lb/>cilities to discover his leading principles were not<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>given me&#44; but had he swerved from the path<lb/> of rectitude&#44; I would have learned it from those &#91;&#63;&#93; parties who<lb/> came near to him.  On the contrary&#44; veracious per&#45;<lb/>&#45;sons from with whom I casually conversed with in refe&#45;<lb/>&#45;rence to C.....S......were unanimous in<lb/> their approval of his conduct&#44; and my personal<lb/> observation brought home to my mind the conviction<lb/> that he united with an honest heart&#44; an intellect<lb/> well equipped in practical general knowledge.  Men<lb/> of that calibre are not very plentiful&#44; and<lb/> the departure demise of one avowedly so endowed&#44; is a<lb/> misfortune.  But the grief of that loss is<lb/> intensified by the thought of the shocking woeful man&#45;<lb/>&#45;ner in which it was met.  To go in quest<lb/> of an innocent and invigorating exercise and<lb/> encounter death&#44; is to leave behind a sorrow pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;found.  To the bereaved&#44; who received this severe<lb/> thrust&#44; reopening wounds that time cannot never<lb/> entirely heal&#44; I point out the great restorative.<lb/>  Faith sustained by reason.  Nothing is lost&#44;<lb/> not an atom but it is reproduced in some other<lb/> form.  Nature attests it&#44; religion proclaims it.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Season follows season&#44; and what lay dormant is rewakened&#45;&#45;<lb/> and we read &#34;The spirit of God made me&#44; and the breath of the Almighty will<lb/> revive me.&#34; an With them the faculties which in all reality con&#45;<lb/>&#45;stitute our being&#44; and move us to action&#44; end in<lb/> annihilation&#63;  Never.  The sentiments which stirred<lb/> C.....S..... to action deeds of goodness live.  He is not<lb/> dead because his limbs are rigid&#44; so long as the<lb/> spirit has noblest part of him returned unto that God Lord who gave it.  He My brother<lb/> might have dwelt among us yet&#44; at least&#44; another<lb/> score of years&#44; and continued an example of honesty integrity&#44;<lb/> but &#91;Hebrew&#93; countless are the worlds created by<lb/> infinite wisdom&#44; and higher and higher still will<lb/> the soul rise in the realms of immortality.<lb/></p>
