            <p>For the Sabbath before Passover<lb/>
                It was altered and corrected&#44; and<lb/>
                partly published in the Record<lb/>

            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;O ye seed of Abraham his servant&#44; O ye<lb/> children of Jacob his chosen ones.  It is the Eternal our God&#44; whose<lb/> judgments are seen throughout the earth.  For He hath ever remembered<lb/> his covenant&#44; the word he ordered for a thousand generations&#34;<lb/>  Aye&#44; while nature shall perform the will of her Creator&#44; while the<lb/> sun shall brighten our horizons<lb/> the moon and the stars shed their<lb/> radiance&#44; Israel will continue a nation indestructible and unchanged.<lb/>  Let us glory&#44; my Brethren&#44; in that celestial declaration&#44; let it incite<lb/> us to solemnize the birth&#45;day of our national existence&#44; with joyous<lb/> hallelujahs.  Setting at our case&#44; on the memorable night of<lb/> Passover&#44; our minds will review the eventful past .  Like in<lb/> a panorama&#44; the Pharaohs of all ages&#44; those tyrants&#44; whose iron&#45;<lb/>rod scourged our fathers&#44; will present themselves before our vision.<lb/>  There stands the great leviathan&#44; who in the pride of his heart<lb/> had said &#34;the Nile is mine&#44; even I have made it&#34; but lo&#33; the<lb/> abyss has engulphed him&#59; he shall rise no more.  The blas&#45;<lb/>&#45;pheming chieftain of the Assyrian host follows.  His sharp&#45;<lb/>edged sword threatens extermination.  Who shall cope with<lb/> so formidable a power&#63;  But the breath of our God blows thereon&#44;<lb/> and it suddenly withers.  The plains of Judea are whitened with<lb/> the bones of the slain.  Our eyes rest an instant upon a city<lb/> of brazen gates&#44; and lowering walls.  Its loftiness seems to<lb/></p>

            <p>defy heaven itself&#44; but the pride of Nebucadnezar sinks down below<lb/> the level of the swelling Euphrates.  No vestige is left of oppressive<lb/> Babylon.  We then turn to gaze on that crowned head&#44; who<lb/> set up his abominable idol into the holy of holies.  His aspect<lb/> excites within us conflicting sentiments.  We know not whether to<lb/> triumph over the inglorious end&#44; or pity the folly of the Tyro&#45;Grecian<lb/> monarch.  For&#44; the sworn enemy of Israel&#39;s God is cankered by a<lb/> fulsome distemper.  Scarcely has he disappeared from that flitting<lb/> scene&#44; when we are appalled at the gaunt visage of one stricken<lb/> likewise with corroding ills.  It is the treacherous Idumean&#44; who<lb/> reached the throne&#44; by wading through rivers of guiltless blood.<lb/>  It is Herod&#44; the destroyer of the Asmonean&#39;s noble race and Judah&#39;s<lb/> hope.  A soraing eagle&#44; scenting from afar off&#44; the victims<lb/> which he had prepared&#44; darted upon its prey&#44; and devoured the<lb/> fairest portion of Jacob.  Then faggots and pyres can be seen&#44; reek&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing with the mangled bodies of the martyrs of our faith.  Then<lb/> we behold our Sages sealing with their blood the truths they<lb/> had proclaimed.  At that grievous spectacle&#44; we exclaim in the words<lb/> of the yearly repeated narrative &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Not only one has arisen against us&#44; but in all ages men have<lb/> arisen against us to exterminate us.  And yet&#44; we live&#44; beloved<lb/></p>

            <p>children of my people&#44; we live&#44; and they who sorely afflicted us&#44;<lb/> exist solely in the pages of ancient history&#44; or are gasping for<lb/> breath.  The Roman empire&#44; that long held us in its iron grasp&#44;<lb/> was shattered into fragments.  Spain and Portugal&#44; whose dominions<lb/> extended from hemisphere to hemisphere&#44; when the exiles of Judea found<lb/> therein asylum and promotion&#44; is reduced to a shadow of then its<lb/> former self.  Verily the promise given to the godly Abraham&#44;<lb/> has descended on his progeny.  They that bless Israel&#44; obtain blessings&#44;<lb/> but they that curse us&#44; bring down on their heads divine imprecations.<lb/>  But are ye not&#44; my Brethren&#33; witnesses of a divine interposition<lb/> that rescues us from destruction human machinations&#63;  Consider what the Lord our God<lb/> did to the two kings who of late conspired against our own race.<lb/>  Our hearts were seized with consternation at the revival of the horrid days<lb/> of the &#91;&#63;&#93; and inquisition.  We asked&#44; we implored.  The sound<lb/> of a mother&#39;s wailing rang through the length and breadth of the civilized world.<lb/>  Yet the modern Pharaoh&#44; supported by his fanatical ally&#44; would not<lb/> relent.  The voice of outraged humanity did not withhold the<lb/> engine set in motion to harrow the tenderest affections implanted by<lb/> nature.  But who has ever laid his hand against the chosen<lb/> of God&#44; and was not requited&#63;  Stretch your vision beyond the<lb/> Alps&#44; my beloved hearers&#33; and behold the miracle wrought by the<lb/> Guardian of Israel.  The sceptre once so formidable&#44; is<lb/></p>

            <p>quivering in the feeble hand of our oppressor.  Vain are the endea&#45;<lb/>&#45;vours of his hierarchical functionaries to uphold the decaying power.<lb/>  Against the walls of the Vatican an avenging hand has written &#34;Mene<lb/> Mene Tekel upharson.&#34;  The amplitude of the land mastered over<lb/> by a priestly&#45;king&#44; is&#44; like that of his Teutonic confederate&#45;&#45;<lb/>given unto a new victor&#45;&#45;even unto thee O Emanuel.  Let us then<lb/> raise the cup of salvation&#44; brimful of gratitude&#44; and on the night<lb/> that our brethren&#44; who have been delivered from a yoke doubly insup&#45;<lb/>&#45;portable&#44; sing the praises of their living Redeemer&#44; let us also<lb/> acknowledge that He &#34;hath brought us forth from sorrow to joy&#44;<lb/> from mourning to a festive season&#44; from darkness to a great light&#34;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> But the expression of our thankfulness to the Almighty&#44; must not<lb/> die away with the night which elicits it.  It must be fruitful<lb/> of actions.  We openly avow that our <sic>marvellous</sic> preservation<lb/>; was designed by the Ruler of the universe.  What duties does it<lb/> then entail upon us&#63;  Can we imagine then for a moment&#44; to<lb/> consist of the cleansing of our dwellings from all leaven&#44; and<lb/> on the recital of the haggada&#63;  Will that entitle us to the glorious<lb/> appellation of God&#39;s chosen people&#63;  No&#44; our actions&#44; my friends&#33;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>our actions&#44; will prove as such.  The greater will be our exertions<lb/> in furthering the object of our national existence&#44; the higher shall we<lb/> stand in the presence of the Eternal.  Israel has been declared his<lb/> first&#45;born&#44; but in order that he might teach the younger branches of the<lb/> human family the way of truth.  His life shaped after the<lb/> model shown unto him at Sinai&#44; must in silent eloquence preach<lb/> rectitude&#44; self&#45;denial&#44; charity and piety.  It must draw the<lb/> confession from the gentiles&#44; that no nation has statutes and<lb/> judgments so righteous&#44; as those which Moses taught govern their lives Moses promulgated.  But in<lb/> order that our efforts may ever tend towards that noble goal&#44;<lb/> we must be illumined by a light from above.  Our beacon must<lb/> be our comprehension of the doctrines contained in Holy Writ.<lb/>  So long as we remain in ignorance of their spiritual import&#44;<lb/> our religion will be but the performance of sundry practices&#44; from which a<lb/> sneer of the scoffers may estrange us.  Our religion will be but a<lb/> structure raised on a bed of sand.  If we desire to <sic>fulfil</sic> our task<lb/> we should become deeply imbued with the verities of which we are the<lb/> depositories.  That is the learning we should most assiduously cultivate&#44;<lb/> for the prophet has written&#44; that &#34;when our children are taught of the<lb/> Lord&#44; their peace will be great&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> yes&#44; the moral happiness of Israel depends on the knowledge and the<lb/> execution of the will of their Maker.  The world&#44; which now&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>even in countries that boast of equality&#44; asperse their name&#44; will encircle<lb/> their brows with the laurels of religious supremacy&#44; when all their<lb/> offspring shall exhibit a life of stainless purity.  Such is our<lb/> mission&#44; my Brethren&#44; during the protracted captivity.  Our fathers<lb/> endured the first in Chaldea&#44; that the land of the patriarchs might be<lb/> purged of idolatry&#44; we suffer the second&#44; that the men of every land may<lb/> learn from us to cast off the image of silver and gold which he hath<lb/> made to worship&#44; to the moles and to the bats&#44; so that the Lord alone be<lb/> exalted &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  We must therefore return to<lb/> the path we have abandoned.  Instead of intoxicating the minds of our<lb/> children with foreign lore&#44; let us point out to them the purling waters&#44; which<lb/> descend from the hills of Zion&#44; whence blessing cometh to Israel.  Between<lb/> each caress and each embrace&#44; let us speak to them of their noble origin&#44;<lb/> of their matchless history&#44; of their admirable laws.  Let us speak also<lb/> of the devotion with which our ancestors clung to the standard of<lb/> truth&#44; when the whole of mankind was arrayed against them&#44; of<lb/> their glorious destiny&#44; of their divinely promised redemption.<lb/></p>
            <p>This is chiefly demanded of us by the ensuing festival&#44; for we are thus<lb/> enjoined &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Thou shalt tell thy children on that day.  This is done because of that<lb/> which the Lord wrought for me&#44; when I went out of Egypt&#34;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>Our living word must kindle in their breasts the religious<lb/> feelings which will pervade their future existence.  And nature<lb/> has lent us the means for its accomplishment.  We are regarded by<lb/> our tender offspring&#44; as the best interpreters of the word of God.<lb/>  None can therefore impress it more deeply on their hearts.  Zealous men<lb/> may aid us in irrigating the plants we have reared&#44; but we must fully<lb/> qualify ourselves for the holy charge trust.  Our own culture must supply<lb/> our tendrils with vitality.  Still&#44; our mission of love&#44; though steadily<lb/> pursued in our homesteads will be but imperfectly executed&#44; when circum&#45;<lb/>&#45;scribed within that sphere.  A learned expositor has said&#44; that Holy<lb/> Writ&#44; by the expression &#34;thou shalt tell thy son&#34; implies also the child of<lb/> every one of our fellow&#45;believers.  We are therefore bid the to carry beyond<lb/> its pale the instruments of salvation.  Wherever thou canst exercise thy<lb/> faculties for the spiritual improvement of thy coreligionists&#44; there&#44; O my Brother&#33;<lb/> be numbered among the foremost.  In what place soever thou canst bring<lb/> to bear the influence of thy kindly instincts to bear on the advancement of Israel&#44;<lb/> there my sister&#33; labor with alacrity.  Be not deterred by the weight<lb/> of the charge.  Suffice it if thou bringest a willing mind to cooperate<lb/> towards the elevation of thy race.  The work will not be completed by thee<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; but even&#44; like the handful of flour&#44; which was<lb/> accepted by God&#44; as a holocaust&#44; will thy exertions be counted righteous&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness by Him that watches our steps.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p>Let then&#44; beloved hearers&#33; the ensuing Passover&#44; while it awakens<lb/> grateful emotions&#44; remind us also of our obligations as the first&#45;born<lb/> of the Eternal Creator.  While our enfranchisement from the shackles of ancient<lb/> and modern Pharaohs enliven our national spirits&#44; let it admonish<lb/> us to betake ourselves to sober actions&#44; so that we may here&#45;<lb/>&#45;after stand before the world as the prototype of holiness and<lb/> virtue&#44; that our conduct round our fire&#45;sides&#44; in social intercourse<lb/> and in public relations&#44; may reflect lustre on our nation&#44; glory<lb/> on our religion&#44; and exaltation on the name of the One<lb/> protecting God we adore.  So may it be.  Amen.<lb/></p>
