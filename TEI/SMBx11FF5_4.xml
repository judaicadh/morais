            <p>A sermon for the<lb/>Thanksgiving&#45;day<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Beloved hearers&#33;  To judge every person favorably&#44; is<lb/> a maxim of our Sages&#44; which&#44; if it were exercised in all our<lb/> dealings with our fellow&#45;men&#44; would render us happier&#44; and<lb/> gladden the earth with an abundance of peace.  How frequently<lb/> the misinterpretation of a word incautiously uttered&#44; has occasioned<lb/> strife and enmity&#44; and yet a little more charity&#44; a more amicable<lb/> disposition on our part&#44; would have pacified the exasperated mind&#44;<lb/> and reconciled the alienated heart.  And in such a spirit<lb/> it is that I would recommend the proclamation of our Governor&#44;<lb/> to be regarded&#59; namely&#44; with charity and friendliness.  Could the<lb/> magistrate of this enlightened commonwealth&#44; have so far been<lb/> unmindful of his duty&#44; as to offend by an anomalous expression<lb/> a large portion of citizens under his jurisdiction&#63;  Could a reverer<lb/> of the Bible&#44; have so prodigiously erred&#44; as to neglect inviting<lb/> them&#44; who taught mankind how to pray to the Maker of all<lb/> and how to thank Him&#44; when the hundreds of thousands of human<lb/> beings that populate this State&#44; were to gather themselves with<lb/> that sacred design&#63;  No&#44; let us rather believe that a long<lb/> established habit of rendering the term &#34;Christians&#34; <sic>synonimous</sic><lb/> with a civilized nation&#44; has given it a place in his proclamation&#44;<lb/> and that in it he imagined presumed to comprehend all the denziens that<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>breathe the free air of Pennsylvania.  It would be inopportune<lb/> on this day consecrated to the Lord&#44; to discuss whether the usage alluded<lb/> to&#44; when subjected to an important analysis&#44; could be declared&#44; the<lb/> offspring of truth&#44; or merely an unfounded assumption.  We will<lb/> leave the solution of that query to a more seasonable period&#59; to&#45;<lb/>day it will suffice us to know&#44; that the temporal Director of<lb/> this Community&#44; did not deem the general acceptation of that phrase&#44;<lb/> a cogent reason to impel us to observe the day with our brethren of a<lb/> different creed&#44; and that he has appointed this Sabbath in its stead.<lb/></p>
            <p>But if in compliance with his counsel&#44; we have delayed offering<lb/> upon the altar of the Eternal&#44; sentiments of gratitude&#44; yet&#44; neither<lb/> is their intensity relaxed&#44; nor are our &#91;&#63;&#93; wishes less2 fervent for1 the<lb/> prosperity of this country&#44; than those which the followers of other<lb/> doctrines have already poured forth.  Doubly sacred<lb/> then is this Sabbath&#44; when we assemble to worship God as<lb/> Israelites&#44; in obedience to the Decalogue&#44; and to thank Him as<lb/> citizens of this Republic&#44; on which He has bestowed numberless blessings.<lb/>  Dear Brethren&#33;  If the recollection that&#44; alike the heavenly<lb/> glory of Sinai&#44; and the terrestrial lustre of the American Constitution reflect upon<lb/> us&#44; is capable of arousing within us a dignified sense of our lofty<lb/> position&#44; we must indeed heartily join in timing a hallelujah to<lb/> to Him whose grace has been peculiarly manifested toward us&#59; we will<lb/></p>

            <p>&#34;Many O Lord my God&#33; are Thy wonderful works which Thou hast<lb/> done&#44; and many are Thy kindly thoughts towards us&#44; they are too many<lb/> to be enumerated&#59; I would recount them&#44; nay&#44; I would enlarge upon<lb/> them&#44; but they are endless&#34;  The words which I have just<lb/> recited&#44; and which I selected as the text of my discourse&#44; are the<lb/> outpouring of a heart&#44; whose thrills of devotion have pierced the<lb/> immensity of space&#44; and reached the ears of thousands of generations.<lb/>  Not alone his faithful descendants&#44; but they also who spring<lb/> from a branch severed from the root of Jesse&#44; delight to address<lb/> the Deity in the inspired language of the Hebrew King.<lb/></p>
            <p>The harp of Zion may hang still upon the willows&#44; but methinks<lb/> I hear its echo reverberate&#44; when the voice of multitudes shouts<lb/> to the Lord the sweet strains which it did once accompany<lb/> with its mellow notes.  And to this sublime accord&#44; to this<lb/> unison of voices and thoughts&#44; our grateful hearts urge us&#44; on this<lb/> day of thanksgiving.  Yes&#44; many are&#44; O our divine Benefactor&#33; the<lb/> benefits Thou hast showered on us&#44; too many to be narrated.
