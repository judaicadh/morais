            <p>Rabbi S. Morais&#44; Philadelphia.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Sir&#58;&#45;&#45; Your postal card is just received. I<lb/> lay everything else aside for the moment in order to answer to<lb/> answer without delay the lines of a gentleman and a colleague<lb/> whom I sincerely revere. As to the &#91;Hebrew&#93; I have to say that the<lb/> parts of the book as the successively appeared reached me duly&#44;<lb/> and that since a considerable time I am in the possession of the<lb/> whole book. Not only do I possess it&#44;&#45;&#45; I add also that I have<lb/> read it from beginning to end with pleasure and with profit. It<lb/> is a source of regret to me that the correspondence thus far published<lb/>stops with the year &#91;Hebrew&#93;. I am inclined to think that Luzz&#39;s corres&#45;<lb/>pondence during the last 25 years of his life must be still more in&#45;<lb/>structive and interesting. Is there no reason to hope that the pub&#45;<lb/>lication of Luzzato&#39;s letters will be continued&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>Another question permit me. Have you still a copy of<lb/> the Penateuch with Luzz.&#39;s commentary on hand&#44; and what would<lb/> be the price of it&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your articles in the &#34;Jew. Record&#34; against Wise were both<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; in their essence and in their form&#44; in their incisive<lb/> criticism and yet their gentlemanly tone perfect gems. But will they<lb/> practically be of any avail whatsoever&#63; The President of the<lb/> Hebrew Union College and Editor of the &#34;Amer. Israelite&#34;will  not in the<lb/></p>

            <p>Dr. B. Felsenthal.<lb/>
                237 South Desplaines Street.<lb/></p>
            <p>Chicago&#44; April 28. 1884<lb/></p>
                
            <p>least be weakened in the influence he possesses. He is a  peculiar<lb/> man&#44; and in order to satisfy his boundless ambition&#44; he employs peculiar<lb/> means&#44; from which many other teachers of religion would shrink back.<lb/> It was a hard word&#44; but it was a true word&#44; which a contributor to the<lb/> J. Record said some weeks ago&#44;&#45;&#45;the word that I.M. Wise was <hi rend="underline">mentally</hi> and<lb/> <hi rend="underline">morally</hi> unfit to occupy the position he holds.<lb/></p>
            <p>A countereffect to his influence can not be brought about by<lb/> <hi rend="underline">any</hi> writing. Quietly proceeding to establish another seat of learning<lb/> where the Science of Judaism would be fostered&#44;&#45;&#45;this is the only effective<lb/> way left open&#44; in my opinion&#44; to the friends of such learning. Efforts should be<lb/> made to establish two professorships for Talmudical literature &#38;c on the<lb/> Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Hebrew Grammar and Semitic philo&#45;<lb/>logy in general the students could already at present pursue there far<lb/> better under Prof. Haupt than under &#34;Professor&#34; Mannheimer. Neubauer&#44;<lb/> of Oxford&#44; I should think&#44; might readily assent to go to Baltimore as a Pro&#45;<lb/>fessor&#44; if a respectable salary would be paid to him. Moreover there is<lb/> Szold in Baltimore&#44; and he could lend his help as an instructor in Tal&#45;<lb/>mudical literature. The sums necessary for founding 2 or 3 professorships<lb/> should in quiet way be collected&#44;&#45;&#45; and would this be such a diffi&#45;<lb/>cult and hopeless undertaking&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>I hope&#44; dear Sir&#44; you will pardon me for having been so garru&#45;<lb/>lous and tiresome to you in this present letter. I couldn&#39;t help it.<lb/> Unvoluntarily my pen glided on after I had touched the subject. I<lb/> thought&#44; as in former times &#91;Hebrew&#93; used to say&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#91;.&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>With sincere regards I remain<lb/>
                Yours very truly<lb/>
