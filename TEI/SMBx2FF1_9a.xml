            <p>as Yehudah&#45;Yoducha&#59; Dan&#45;Yadua&#45;God&#45;Gidad.  Were I not at present much<lb/> occupied&#44; I would write more at length&#44; and possibly to your satisfaction.

                June 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1874<lb/></p>
            <p>Revd. S. Morais<lb/>
            Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>In our Jewish paper &#34;The Hebrew&#34; of May<lb/> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> last I read a sermon of yours on &#34;The study of the Hebrew&#59;&#34;<lb/> in which I found an idea concerning the Hebrew Language&#44; so to&#45;<lb/>tally different from my preconceived views of the subject&#44; that I<lb/> have taken the liberty&#44; through a stranger&#44; of writing to you for in&#45;<lb/>formation.  The origin of the Hebrew language&#44; has been a matter of<lb/> serious thought to me for many years past&#59; and I have been during<lb/> that period looking earnestly for light on the subject&#44; and as you inci&#45;<lb/>dentally treat of it&#44; I write&#44; in the hope that you can give me the<lb/> information I seek.  The following is the passage I want cleared up.<lb/>  &#34;Not their ignorance of another peoples&#39; language suggested the term<lb/>&#45;&#45;in the sentence of the heaven&#45;gifted poet&#44; <hi rend="underline">but their retention of the<lb/> ancestral language</hi>&#44; their cherishing it&#44; and setting therefore a value&#44;<lb/> which made them consider strange what was not Hebrew.  The merit<lb/> of having affectionately kept it as a distinguishing characteristic&#44; is<lb/> reckoned by the sages as one of the virtues that purchased Israel&#39;s deliv&#45;<lb/>erance.  But even if we are disinclined to accept the Rabbinical axiom<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>we cannot gainsay this truth.  Our predecessors&#44; who responded to the vic&#45;<lb/>torious song of their champion on the shore of the Red Sea&#59; our predecessors&#44;<lb/> who stood at the foot of Sinai to receive the Divine Mandate&#44; must have<lb/> treasured up a perfect knowledge of the language&#44; brought from Canaan<lb/> by the seventy persons who formed the nucleus of a future nationality&#59; and<lb/> that they accomplished in spite of a refined despotism&#44; bent upon extinguish&#45;<lb/>ing every sentiment of union among the enslaved.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>You say the Israelites carried the Hebrew Language with them<lb/> into Egypt.  Where did it come from&#63;  Abraham was a Chaldee<lb/> and the Chaldee is not Hebrew&#63;  Isaac went to Chaldea to get a wife<lb/> and Jacob went there and got &#91;&#63;&#93; and remained there twenty years<lb/> according to some commentators&#44; forty years according to others&#59; conse&#45;<lb/>quently the whole family must have talked Chaldee.<lb/></p>
            <p>Philo&#44; who I suppose you will take as good evidence&#44; says in his<lb/> 4th volume&#44; in his treatise &#34;On the virtues and office of Ambassadors&#34;<lb/> &#34;and this nation of suppliants <hi rend="underline">is in the Chaldee language&#44; called Israel</hi>&#44;<lb/> but when the name is translated into the Greek language it is called &#34;the<lb/> seeing nation.&#34;  Now this name Israel&#44; was given Jacob at Penuel<lb/> by an angel of God&#44; and it being Chaldee&#44; we must suppose the angel<lb/> talked with him in that language&#44; which would not have been the<lb/> case&#44; had there been a Hebrew language at that time.  Moreover&#44;<lb/> how can you account for the presentation of their original tongue<lb/> by the <hi rend="underline">descendants of seventy persons</hi>&#44; during a period of 400 years<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>when the many ten thousands who were carried captive to Babylon<lb/> lost their mother tongue in <hi rend="underline">seventy years</hi>&#8212;so that at their return<lb/> to Jerusalem&#44; they had to Employ <hi rend="underline">interpreters</hi> in the synagogue<lb/> that the people might understand&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>The object of my inquiry is&#44; <hi rend="underline">what proof</hi> have you&#44; that<lb/> Jacob and his <sic>desendants</sic> talked in the Hebrew tongue on their<lb/> entrance into Egypt.  I maintain there was no Hebrew language<lb/> at that time.<lb/></p>
            <p>You will oblige me if at your earliest leisure&#44; you would<lb/> let me hear your solution of this question.<lb/></p>

            <p>Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>Your letter of the 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> ult&#44; came to hand just now.  I hasten to<lb/> reply as briefly as the subject allows.  Without discussing at all the question as to<lb/> the language <hi rend="underline">first</hi> spoken&#44;&#45;&#45;through <hi rend="underline">Adam</hi> from <hi rend="underline">Adamah</hi>&#44; and <hi rend="underline">Isha</hi> from <hi rend="underline">Ish</hi> would<lb/> entitle the Hebrew to the right of primogeniture&#44; we may confidently say that at the earliest<lb/> periods of Biblical history&#44; the Aramaic and Hebrew were very near &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; similar to the<lb/> Spanish and Portuguese of an days.  The fact that the Alphabet&#44;&#45;&#45;doubtless of very ancient<lb/> origin&#44; and according to the sages coeval with creation&#44; contains the names of letters like Beth<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; and Nua &#40;Aramaic&#41; &#38;c &#38;c&#44; carries out the views generally &#91;crossed&#45;out&#93; entertained.  Gradually&#44; however&#44;<lb/> the two languages separated&#44; so much so that at the time of Jacob they were distinct.  The patriarch<lb/> called the heap of Homes set up to tish&#91;&#63;&#93; to his promise &#34;Gol Ed&#34;&#44; while &#91;&#63;&#93; named<lb/> &#34;Yegar Sahadutah.&#34;  The opinion of Philo in the point at issue is of no value.  I believe<lb/> that the good and learned Jew had no knowledge of Hebrew.  Our Hellenist brethren used the<lb/> Greek even in public worship.  A tyro will perceive that Israel is anological to <hi rend="underline">Jasar Eb</hi>&#44;<lb/> as the cont&#91;&#63;&#93; shows&#44; <del>namely</del> &#40;having power over the mighty&#41;; as the prophet Hosea intimates&#44;<lb/> and as Josephus&#8212;no main authority&#44; confirms.  The difference between the history of our fathers in<lb/> Egypt&#44; and our predecessors in Babylon&#44; in connection with the sacred tongue&#44; is clearly explained in<lb/> the <del>Bible</del> Scriptures.  While intermarriages with heathen women happened constantly during the captivity in Chaldea&#44;<lb/> in the land of the Pharaohs&#44; they very rarely took place.  In one case the mothers taught their vernacular<lb/> to the exclusion of the Hebrew&#44; in the other&#44; such influences were not at work.<lb/></p>
            <p>The proof that the 70 persons who emigrated to Egypt spoke the Hebrew&#44; is&#44; among others&#44; the<lb/> following.  The blessing of Jacob to the tribes&#44; where notwithstanding modern criticism denying its avowed<lb/> authorship&#44; bears internal evidences of its genuineness&#59; contains several homonyms&#44; that can best carried out in the Hebrew&#44;<lb/></p>
