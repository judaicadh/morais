            <p>Shield of Abraham&#33;  Before the mountains were<lb/> brought forth&#59; ere Thou didst form the earth and<lb/> the whole universe&#44; even from everlasting to everlasting<lb/> Thou art God.  And like Thy existence&#44; so does Thy<lb/> word abide for ever&#44; and so is Thy will faithfully<lb/> executed.  To the childless father&#44; who walked before<lb/> Thee in truth&#44; Thou didst promise a numerous<lb/> offspring&#44; and behold&#33; by them is Thy name daily<lb/> invoked.  With their faces directed towards that<lb/> hallowed country&#44; whence the righteous man arose&#44;<lb/> who first proclaimed Thy Unity&#44; they devotionally<lb/> address Thy throne&#44; and implore grace&#44; for the sake<lb/> of Abraham Thy servant.  Hearken unto their<lb/> entreaties&#44; Thou who rememberest the covenant of<lb/> the patriarchs.  When the sins of Thy people&#44;<lb/> testify against them&#44; let the merits of their ancient<lb/> father ward off Thy chastisement.  For&#44; to do<lb/> that which is pleasing in Thy sight&#44; did Abraham<lb/> suppress filial tenderness and the love of his native<lb/> land.  To <sic>fulfil</sic> Thy heavenly charge&#44; he<lb/> betook himself to climes he knew not before.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Confident in the justice of Thy decrees&#44; he did not mur&#45;<lb/>&#45;mur when famine impelled him again to roam<lb/> abroad in quest of food.  His faith in Thee did<lb/> likewise sustain him&#44; when he girded his loins to<lb/> rescue the oppressed&#44; and humble the oppressors.<lb/>  When an appalling vision terrified his mind&#44; and<lb/> he prophetically beheld unutterable sufferings&#45;&#45;into<lb/> the cause of which he could not dive&#45;&#45;he silently<lb/> bowed to Thy inscrutable fiat.  When in<lb/> maturer years&#44; Thou didst bid him subject his<lb/> body to writing pains&#44; his prompt obedience<lb/> evinced his piety.  Many O Lord&#33; were the<lb/> trials which Abraham steadfastly underwent&#44;<lb/> and which obtained for him the glorious appella&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of God&#39;s friend.  He was shown the<lb/> effect of justice upon the wicked&#44; and to avert<lb/> from them a condign retribution&#44; he poured out<lb/> his righteous soul at the footstool of Thy mercy.<lb/>  He was constrained to cast from his bosom the cherished<lb/> son of his handmaid&#45;&#45;to secure thereby domestic peace&#45;&#45;<lb/>and he resignedly endured the bereavement.  To<lb/> prove to the heathen world&#44; which sacrificed<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>human victims to false deities&#44; the love he bore Thee&#44;<lb/> he laid upon Thy altar all his terrestrial happiness&#59;<lb/> aye&#44; the life of his long&#45;prayed for child&#44; ready to<lb/> burn it in honor of Thee&#44; as an oblation.  Grant<lb/> therefore O Lord&#33; that the his merits may propitiate<lb/> Thy blessings on his descendants&#44; for&#44; unto him Thou<lb/> didst promise that Thou wilt be their everlasting<lb/> Protector.  Almighty King&#33; the days of<lb/> our godly ancestor did not exceed those of his contem&#45;<lb/>&#45;poraries&#44; that he might experience the fulfil&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment of Thy declarations&#44; but form the supernal<lb/> abode in which his soul is imparadised&#44; he sees<lb/> it even this day&#44; through the length and breadth<lb/> of the habitable globe.  Grant we beseech<lb/> Thee&#44; that we may ever live in Thy presence&#44;<lb/> as the worthy children of one so faithful.  Grant<lb/> that when the period of our probation shall end&#44;<lb/> and in accordance with the prediction of Thy inspired<lb/> servants&#44; the remnant of Thy people shall have<lb/> been tried as gold is tried&#44; we may still rehearse<lb/> thy praises in the beauteous Zion&#44; as the only<lb/> true God&#44; and the Shield of Abraham.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>But while it is Thy will that Thy children wor&#45;<lb/>&#45;ship Thee in the lands of their sojourn&#44; grant<lb/> that their religious sentiments may never suffer<lb/> Thy name to be profaned among the gentiles.<lb/>  Grant that the minor sanctuaries&#44; wherein<lb/> they seek Thy face&#44; may nowhere draw their <sic>exist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance</sic> from a violation of Thy ordinances.<lb/>  Infuse into the heart of Israel&#44; the spirit which<lb/> incited their predecessors&#44; and they will&#44; not by<lb/> usurious loans&#44; but by munificent gifts&#44; support<lb/> Thy holy dwelling.  Not for our sake&#44;<lb/> O Lord&#33; not for our sake&#44; but for that of Thy<lb/> name&#44; let not the institution consecrated to<lb/> Thy glory&#44; languish and decay&#44; lest thy people<lb/> become a derision&#44; and Thy law be forgotten<lb/> in our midst.  Open Thou to a righteous<lb/> understanding the minds of those who have<lb/> erred in spirit&#44; that they may atone for their<lb/> trespasses&#44; by sanctifying the Holy One of Jacob&#44;<lb/> and glorifying the God of Abraham&#44; in the lands<lb/> of their captivity.  So may it be even with<lb/> us speedily in our days.  Amen.<lb/></p>
