            <p>My dear Friend&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>I have thought a<lb/> good deal further about the subject<lb/> to which I called your attention lately.<lb/>  When I was downtown last Sabbath<lb/> I heard some particulars about the<lb/> state of affairs at Ridley&#39;s&#44; which<lb/> made me very anxious&#44; &#38; rendered<lb/> prompt action imperative.  The number<lb/> of intermarriages which have taken place<lb/> is large&#44; <del>&#38; the morality</del> where Christian<lb/> &#38; Jewish young people are thrown<lb/> together without any restraint the<lb/> morality is <del>loss</del> questionable.  I saw<lb/> Mr. R. to&#45;day&#58; he says that he<lb/> feels it his duty&#44; even if it be<lb/> opposed to business&#44; to advance the<lb/> moral standing of his Employees&#44;<lb/> the <del>ward</del> stated further that it was<lb/> his desire that his entire force<lb/> of Jewish working people &#40;196<lb/> <del>adults</del> mostly young people &#40;15 to 30 years&#41;<lb/></p>

            <p>should attend the service &#38; he<lb/> would grant them one hour&#44; without<lb/> reduction &#40;Saturday 10.30 to 11.30&#41;.<lb/>  He told me that he discussed last<lb/> year an employee who worked on<lb/> Kippur.  His son &#40;who married a Jewess&#41;<lb/> is also strongly in favor of it.  Perhaps<lb/> <del>his is</del> the tale of Queen Esther is<lb/> being played here again&#44; &#38; we<lb/> must thank Ridley&#39;s Jewish wife<lb/> for the interest taken.  He also bid<lb/> me to infer that he might in time<lb/> make further concessions&#44; if his<lb/> employees attend regularly&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>I am acting cautiously&#44; however&#44;<lb/> &#38; do not wish to compound a felony.  I<lb/> told him that I only wanted his Jewish<lb/> employees to know that they were<lb/> welcome if they wished to come<lb/> that I desired only a few to attend<lb/> &#38; these the younger ones&#44; as I wished<lb/> to make no change in my present<lb/> service&#44; that my quarters were<lb/></p>

            <p>limited <del>&#38; that</del>.  He appeared satisfied &#38; will send<lb/> me tomorrow a list of the names &#38; addresses of<lb/> his Jewish employees.  <del>I shall</del> Possibly I may know<lb/> some.  Anyway Sunday I shall call on half a dozen&#44;<lb/> &#38; have simply 10 or 15 to attend for the present&#44; &#38;<lb/> trust to them to spread the affair&#44; if they like it.<lb/>  Meanwhile&#44; I have recommended to the Sabbath<lb/> Association &#40;along with other suggestions which you<lb/> will find in the Messenger&#41; the holding of lectures<lb/> on <hi rend="underline">Wednesday Evening</hi> for this very class of people.<lb/></p>
            <p>From Ridley&#39;s tone&#44; I anticipate the<lb/> happiest results.  He deplores that the Jews violate<lb/></p>

            <p>the Sabbath&#44; &#38; hopes that in time other<lb/> Christian retailers may join in allowing<lb/> them a respite on Saturday.  I do not<lb/> see anything inconsistent in letting<lb/> them hear words of prayer on Sabbath &#38;<lb/> <del>a brief</del> the Bible&#44; &#38; a brief discourse&#44; if the<lb/> aim of the latter shall be to remind them<lb/> of their duty to keep the Sabbath holy &#38;<lb/> keep alive a little Judaism in their<lb/> hearts&#44; even if for a short time&#44; &#38; they<lb/> depart again to business.  I believe firmly<lb/> that the children&#39;s psalms &#38; hymns will<lb/> ring in their minds&#44; when they return<lb/> to work&#44; &#38; ultimately bring them to a<lb/> sense of their duty.  If I find that after<lb/> 3 months&#44; no one is induced to leave<lb/> Ridley&#39;s &#38; enter some business &#40;where&#63;&#41;<lb/> in which the Sabbath can be observed&#44;<lb/> I may then adopt a different plan.  Of course<lb/> I do not know the young people&#44; &#38; I cannot<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93; how I may effect them&#59; but if<lb/> there is any Judaism left in their<lb/> veins&#44; I believe I can work it up<lb/> with a flame.  I feel impelled to<lb/> work in this matter.  Nobody else<lb/> seems to care.  <del>It s</del> The olden prophets<lb/></p>
