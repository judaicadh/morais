            <p>Rev Dr. S. Morais<lb/>
                No 548 North Fifth Str<lb/>
                Philadelphia&#44; Pa.<lb/>
                My dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I thank you for your note of the 6th.<lb/> I have a distinct recollection of it being my<lb/> understanding when a boy&#44; that the father of the<lb/> &#34;boys &#38; girls&#34; was Hazan of the Congregation&#44; yet<lb/> I may be mistaken.  How was Eleaser designated<lb/> when called to the Toro&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>I was one of the scholars who studied under the<lb/> Rev. J. Keys and was going to school to him at the<lb/> time of his death.  I shall think that Eleazor&#44;<lb/> and even the youngest of the lot was at least<lb/> 40 years of age at the time of the death of Mr. Keys.<lb/>  I send you by mail the remains of an old pamphlet<lb/> published in Philadelphia 65 years since&#44; <sic>wether</sic> the<lb/> Rabbi Cohen ever came to Philadelphia or not<lb/> I cannot say&#44; but it shows that Philadelphia Jews<lb/> even that long time ago took an interest in our holy<lb/> faith sufficient to leave a book of introduction for<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>the young published.<lb/></p>
            <p>Many old Citizens of Philadelphia must recollect<lb/> the printer W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Fry.  For many years he published<lb/> in connection with Robert Walsh&#44; Consul U. S. at<lb/> Paris under President Tyler&#44; a Newspaper&#44; called the<lb/> &#34;National Gazette&#34;.  His father was doorkeeper<lb/> of the Continental Congress and died from joy<lb/> when the news of the defeat of the Cornwallis was<lb/> received by that august body.<lb/></p>
            <p>My own recollection of the Congregation Mickve<lb/> Israel go back to 1824 or 1825.  I cannot satisfactorily<lb/> locate which&#45;&#45;but on &#34;Yom Kippur&#34; for the first<lb/> time I recollect that my beloved mother took me<lb/> with her to hear the prayers.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Congregation had no synagogue at that<lb/> period.  I think the Cherry Str edifice was<lb/> then building.  The service was held at the residence<lb/> of my relative A. C. Peixotto on&#44; 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Str<lb/> opposite Gowell in the third story and the Tora<lb/> was kept in the drawer of a Mahogany Bureau.<lb/>  The Reader was the Reverend Benoadou<lb/> he came from Barbary and read through<lb/> his nose&#44; methinks I hear him now.&#45;for once<lb/> heard it was never to be forgotten.<lb/></p>
            <p>I recollect distinctly the night of the consecration<lb/> of the Cherry Str <sic>sinagogue</sic>&#44; and I had until<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>lately the published pamphlet of the whole<lb/> proceedings&#44; but it was disappeared much to my<lb/> regret<lb/></p>
            <p>Of the Rev Mr. Keys&#44; as one of his scholars<lb/> I have a most vivid recollection.  He was a good<lb/> man&#45;&#45;considerably hen pecked&#45;&#45;had a fine voice<lb/> and it seemed to me an unmoderate fancy for &#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> he was always drinking it.<lb/></p>
            <p>In his Canonicals&#45;&#45;with knee breeches&#45;&#45;<lb/> silk stockings and low quartered shoes&#44; he looked<lb/> every inch the &#34;Parson&#34;.<lb/></p>  
            <p>I think you will find that you had a Hazan<lb/> of the name of Samuel Nunes Carvalho.  I<lb/> recollect his widow&#45;&#45;she survived her husband<lb/> in very straightened circumstances a number<lb/> of years&#44; dying about 1832.<lb/></p>
            <p>Lightly may the sod even rest on the remains<lb/> of my dear old schoolmaster the Rev. Isaac<lb/> Leeser&#45;&#45;he was the first Hazan in America&#44;<lb/> that delivered lectures in English&#44; but he was<lb/> orthodox to the last days of his life and to me<lb/> he always appeared as a conscientious religious<lb/> man.  I recollect the stormy times in the<lb/> in <sic>the</sic> Congregation before he was selected<lb/> as the successor to Rev. Mr. Keys.  My father<lb/> was chairman of the committee of correspondence<lb/> who invited Leeser to visit Philadelphia&#44; a Mr<lb/> Goldsmith was another member and a Mr<lb/> Cohen&#45;&#45;which one of numerous Cohens&#44; I<lb/> have forgotten.<lb/></p>
            <p>Salaries in those days were very small&#45;&#45;Leeser<lb/> was induced to come under the offer of &#36;1000 pr<lb/> annum&#44; but his first engagement the Congregation<lb/> only gave him &#36;800&#44; equal however to &#36;1500<lb/></p>
