            <p>My dear brethren<lb/></p>
            <p>Noble and majestic is the office of those&#44; who are<lb/> called upon to guide men in the path of truth&#45;&#45;&#44; to assiduously to watch<lb/> over the house of Jacob&#45;&#45;to shine as a lamp before the eyes of the faithful&#44;<lb/> to be as a lanthorn to them who walk in darkness.  Noble but<lb/> momentous is the charge of those who undertake to instruct the<lb/> youth&#44; to comfort the old&#44; to admonish the rich&#44; to console the<lb/> poor&#44; to inspire the love of virtue&#44; the zeal of piety&#44; the courage<lb/> of faith&#45;&#45;to gather all in the tabernacle of the Lord&#44; to bless<lb/> them&#44; to invoke on them the God of justice&#44; the God of mercy&#44;<lb/> to be a living example of devotion&#44; forbearance and charity.<lb/>  Yet such is the mission you have confided to my feeble&#45;hand&#45;&#45;to my<lb/> scanty understanding.  To respond to this calling in a manner<lb/> suitable to its dignity&#45;&#45;to uphold my vocation in its sanctity<lb/> and majesty will be henceforth my sole aim&#44;&#45;&#45;the polar star of<lb/> all my doings.  But you&#44; my dear brethren and sisters&#44;<lb/> grant me your support and indulgence&#44; that my spirits may<lb/> be invigorated&#44; that I may summon new courage in executing this<lb/> arduous task.  And if I occasionally fail in discharging it&#44; to your<lb/> wish and satisfaction&#44; attribute it to my inexperience&#44; but not<lb/> to indolence or disregard of my duties.  And Thou eternal<lb/> fountain of bliss&#44; Lord of Abraham&#33;  <sic>look</sic> down with a pitiful<lb/> eye on thy poor and humble servant&#44; let a spark of thy wisdom<lb/> enlighten my career.  Let thy spirit alone speak in me&#44; a spirit of<lb/> knowledge and understanding&#44; a spirit of judgment and discretion&#44;<lb/> a spirit of love and fear of thee&#44; that my word may find access<lb/></p>

            <p>No great amount of erudition is requisite to know how languages have<lb/> originated.  Men having come in contact with each other&#44; found it<lb/> necs necessary to invent the means of communication.  At first<lb/> their words were few and limited to their mere wants&#44; as time<lb/> rolled on&#44; owing to some accidental circumstances&#44; languages underwent<lb/> changes&#44; they were refined&#44; they became more copious and ultimately<lb/> they obtained that high degree of elegance which they now a days they<lb/> possess.  The history of the English tongue&#44; furnishes us with a<lb/> very obvious example.  The political convulsions to which Great<lb/> Britain was frequently exposed&#44; wrought in its language also&#44;<lb/> extraordinary revolutions&#44; for while one power supplanted the other&#44;<lb/> the language of the conquerors and that of the conquered mingled<lb/> together and eventually produced a richer and a more elaborated<lb/> one.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93; of the most celebrated T.

            <p>Not so with the Hebrew.  Infancy and adolescence are unknown to it.<lb/>  From its origin it was perfect&#44; time has not enhanced its beauty&#44; nor<lb/> have human vicissitudes urged it on towards progress.  Hence the rabbinical<lb/> epithet &#91;Hebrew&#93; holy tongue.  And holy it is&#45;&#45;it is holy&#44; because<lb/> no man had no hand in it&#45;&#45;it is holy&#44; because from the days of<lb/> yore&#44; it stands as an imperishable memento of Him who first taught<lb/> it to the world.  Any one&#44; however slightly conversant with<lb/> our post&#45;biblical literature&#44; must be convinced of this fact.<lb/>  Has not the Bible always been the type after which our most<lb/> famous writers have <sic>modelled</sic> their style&#63;  Of the multifarious works<lb/> issued from the pens of ancient and modern Rabbies&#44; is there any which can compete with the lofty&#44; the inspired&#44; the transcendent<lb/> language&#44; of the book of books&#63;  Most assuredly none.  Every one<lb/> has aimed at the mark&#44; none has attained it.  Even as the<lb/> infant strives to reach its mother&#39;s breast&#44; and spite of its impotency&#44;<lb/> redoubles its efforts&#44; in like manner our renowned authors have<lb/> eagerly striven to shape their productions on that <sic>unparalelled</sic> model.<lb/>  They recognized its supremacy&#44; they knew they could reach the branches<lb/> of the tree&#44; and never the top&#44; yet they clung to it&#44; for they<lb/> sucked therefrom the sweetness of its honey which is pleasant.<lb/>  And if the compositions of Judah A Levy&#44; of Gebirol&#44; of Aben Ezra<lb/> of Erez Wezel and other eminent poets who have enriched the<lb/> treasure of our literature&#44; elicit our admiration&#44; it is because<lb/> we bask in them as in the reflection of a brighter Sun.<lb/>  No&#44; the <sic>hebrew</sic> language claims no earthly birth&#44; it rests on<lb/> high&#44; on the rock of old whence it was hewn&#44; for one people<lb/></p>

            <p>When the Almighty&#44; breathing in to the inanimate clay&#44; produced<lb/> to the world that fathomless being Man&#44; he acquainted him<lb/> to his duties and with his rights&#44; warning him at the same time&#44;<lb/> that should he infringe the former&#44; he would forfeit the latter.<lb/>  Now&#44; every one of us admits that the Deity will not inflict an<lb/> unjust chastisement upon his children&#44; for &#34;He is merciful&#44; How to<lb/> anger and ready to pardon&#44;&#34; therefore ere He imposed on our father<lb/> Adam&#44; certain obligations&#44; on the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of which his future<lb/> wellbeing depended&#44; but the violation of which&#44; made him liable<lb/> to a rigorous punishment&#44; He must needs have imparted to him<lb/> the a thorough knowledge of the language in which he was addressed.<lb/>  You will naturally ask&#44; who assures us that this language was the<lb/> Hebrew&#63;  To this query I shall will reply&#44; by referring you to a passage<lb/> in Genesis.  It runs thus &#34;And the man said&#44; this time&#44; it is<lb/> bone of my bones&#44; and flesh of my flesh&#44; this shall be called<lb/> woman &#91;Hebrew&#93; because from the &#91;Hebrew&#93; man she was taken&#34;H  Is not the<lb/> word &#91;Hebrew&#93; the feminine of the word &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#63;  And it in another place<lb/> &#34;And Adam called the name of his wife &#91;Hebrew&#93; Eve&#44; because she was &#40;to be&#41;<lb/> the mother of all living &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#34;&#216;  Again has not the word &#91;Hebrew&#93; a<lb/> strict consonance of with that of &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#63;  But had I time to expatiate<lb/> much longer on this argument&#44; I could cite&#44; many other passages<lb/> bearing the same remark.  I nevertheless2 feel confident1 that those<lb/> adduced will suffice to corroborate what has been stated&#45;&#45;that the<lb/> Hebrew tongue is of a divine source&#44; consequently called holy&#45;&#45;that<lb/> it was appointed by the Almighty&#44; since He first gave life to<lb/> &#216; Genesis Chapt 3d v 20th  H Genesis Chapt 2d v 23d<lb/></p>

            <p>Let us now throw take a retrospective glance on view of the religious and moral<lb/> state of society at the epoch&#44; when this code of laws to which we<lb/> adhere&#44; issued from the hands of Moses.  Thick darkness pervaded the<lb/> face of the universe.  We see mankind wandering in search of a Superior<lb/> Being&#44; free from material propensities&#44; of a Being above worldly casualties&#44;<lb/> but alas&#33; we see them led astray by their short sighted views.  That still small<lb/> voice which speaks within human hearts&#44; told them of something beyond<lb/> the flesh&#44; beyond limit and space&#44; yet they looked for it in the<lb/> narrowness of their corporeal vision.  They sought him in the sparkling<lb/> firmament&#44;&#45;&#45;the lucid stars which illumine the night&#44; the lunar<lb/> sphere which to man&#39;s sight displays human features&#44; elicited<lb/> their adoration.  When the magnificent luminary that cheers and<lb/> lights up the world&#44; arose in its splendour&#44; they prostrated them&#45;<lb/>&#45;sleves with awe.  As the cl pleas of thunder reverberated through<lb/> the heavens&#44; they bowed before that imaginary god tremendous in mighty.<lb/>  The devouring fire&#44; the stormy hurricane found devoted <sic>worshippers</sic>.<lb/>  The faint idea which they entertained of a Creator&#44; was associated<lb/> with dread&#44; and as a natural consequence&#44; many evils accrued<lb/> from such feelings.

Sometimes indeed&#44;<lb/> dread was blended with love&#44; but what love&#63;  Not a pure&#44; not an<lb/> inspiring&#44; an ethereal love&#44; it was a love calculated only to warm<lb/> the body and brutalize the soul.  All those tendencies which<lb/> man has in common with irrational beings&#44; were brought into action&#44;<lb/> Temples were erected&#44; where people thronged to indulge&#44; without restraint&#44;<lb/> in lewdness&#59; &#38; immorality had arrived at reached its climax.  Unable to soar<lb/> after a more sublime idea of an infinite and loving God&#44; men<lb/> lowered their deities to their condition of themselves&#44; own standard and invested them<lb/> with their own material propensities.  Amidst this aberration<lb/> of human intellect&#44; a religion is proclaimed which deals a deadly blow at<lb/> to idolatry.  The scattered members of paganism are reduced to<lb/> ashes before the refulgent light which it emits&#44; the erroneous and<lb/> noxious belief in many imaginary powers&#44; which spread terror upon throughout<lb/> humanity&#45;&#45;the immoral worship of Isis and Osiris&#44; give room<lb/> to a faith&#44; which inculcates love and adoration to one only God&#44;<lb/> the first cause and centre of all virtues&#45;&#45;reverence and obedience<lb/> to the authors of our days&#45;&#45;our dear parents&#45;&#45;respect to property&#44;<lb/> and to all those social duties&#44; the strict attending to discharge of which can<lb/> alone secure man&#39;s true felicity.  Nor is this sublime doctrine<lb/> delivered only to a family or to a caste.

            <p>To enable us to distinguish between the animals which an<lb/> Israelite is allowed to eat&#44; from those which are forbidden&#44; the<lb/> Mosaic law gives two signs.

But alas&#33; those<lb/> men who had beheld the sight of the living God&#44; were dismayed at<lb/> the sight of men.

The forty<lb/> days of the exploration of the land&#44; are commuted into forty years of<lb/> vagrancy.  The bodies of all that generation of men&#44; are condemned<lb/> to perish in deserted places.  Two individuals alone are to escape&#44; Joshua<lb/> the predestined successor of Moses&#44; and Caleb the son of Yephanne.<lb/>  Their piety saved them.

When the rage of<lb/> the people&#44; like a tempestous torrent whirlwind threatened to carry all before<lb/> it&#44; they sought to curb its violence&#59; they obeyed the voice of the<lb/> Lord and of Moses his servant.  Such a deportment deserved a reward<lb/> and they had it.  After the lapse of five and forty years we see<lb/> them alive&#44; full of vigour and activity.  Time seemed but to have but<lb/> glided over them&#44; for its traces are were scarcely perceivable discernible.  &#34;It is now<lb/> forty five years since the Lord sent us to spy the land of Canaan&#44;&#34; said<lb/> the aged Caleb to Joshua &#34;and yet I am as strong this day as I was in the<lb/> day that Moses sent me&#44; as my strength was then&#44; even so my strength<lb/> is now&#44; for war&#44; both to go out and to come in&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>my beloved friends&#44; it was their piety&#44; their zeal that protected them&#44;<lb/> it was the Lord whom they had faithfully served&#44; who that preserved al them<lb/> alive&#44; &#34;for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven&#44; and<lb/> returneth not thither&#44; but watereth the earth &#38; maketh it&#44; bring forth<lb/> and bud&#44; that it may give &#91;&#63;&#93; bread to the eater2 feed to the sower1&#44; so<lb/> says the Lord&#34; shall my word be that goeth forth out of my<lb/> mouth&#44; it shall never return to me void&#44; but it shall accomplish<lb/> that which I please and speed him for whom I sent it forth&#34; &#216;<lb/> And now before I conclude this lecture&#44; which &#40;without regarding to the<lb/> mode manner in which the subject has been treated&#41; you must have found of some<lb/> importance&#44; let me remind you of my first words&#44; let me exhort<lb/> you to have faith&#45;&#45;faith in God and in his holy statutes&#44; faith in<lb/> the prophets and in their sacred words&#44; faith in our sages and in<lb/> their traditions&#44; faith in the futurity of Israel and in the immortal&#45;<lb/>ity of our soul&#44; which is the anchor of our salvation a in our last hour.<lb/>  Let us warm our hearts and souls in the vivifying fore of the<lb/> law of Sinai&#44; bear in mind that by faith alone our pious ancestors<lb/> surmounted all difficulties&#44; overthrew every obstacle H &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> But at the same time let me remind you that this religion for<lb/> the preservation of which we did and we do yet suffer&#44; is founded upon<lb/> incontestable proofs&#59; that the religion we profess&#44; and fo which has<lb/> been sealed by the blood of thousands of martyrs&#44; stands as immoveable as<lb/> the mount of God where it was delivered.  Let us then cling to<lb/> it&#44; let us hold forth to gather ourselves round this tree which is life to them who lay hold<lb/> of it&#44; let us follow the steps which our blessed law indicates&#44; for her ways<lb/> are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace &#91;Hebrew&#93; H<lb/> H Proverbs Chap 3 v 17 H Jeremiah &#216; Isaiah 55 v 10 and 11<lb/></p>

            <p>Let us show to the world that we are the faithful children of faith&#45;<lb/>ful parents &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>Almighty Father&#33;  It was thy gracious will that Israel should always<lb/> remain a distinct nation&#44; that they might carry the standard of<lb/> truth wherever they sojourned.  It was thy blessed will that Israel<lb/> should incessantly meditate on thy law&#44; that they might<lb/> learn how to serve thee with a pure and a sincere heart.<lb/></p>
            <p>Grant O God&#44; that this holy law may never be forgotten by us&#44;<lb/> by our children&#44; nor by our children&#39;s children.  May it be<lb/> our staff in the pilgrimage of life&#44; our solace in the days of<lb/> calamity.  Grant O God thy heavenly support to all those<lb/> who labour for the diffusions of thy holy behests.  Grant<lb/> prosperity and everlasting peace to this happy country&#44; where<lb/> the residue remnant of Jacob have have found rest for the sole of their feet.<lb/>  May <sic>tranquillity</sic> be within their her gates&#44; and security without.<lb/>  &#34;May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be<lb/> acceptable before thee O Lord my rock and my redeemer&#34;<lb/> H &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> H Psalms 19 v 15<lb/></p>
