            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Israelites.  Had the youth who met with so sudden<lb/> and untimely a death been known and universally ad&#45;<lb/>&#45;mired for excellencies peculiar in their character&#44; I still<lb/> would forbear rehearsing his praise.  For&#44; innumerable<lb/> are the allurements which lead our steps away from the<lb/> path of duty&#59; countless the occasions on which we<lb/> forget the teachings received in our tender years&#44; to and follow<lb/> a system subversive of the lessons which we once<lb/> considered perfect and conducive to happiness.<lb/>  Here&#44; evil surroundings&#44; there&#44; pernicious readings.<lb/>  In some instances&#44; the rising of artificial wants stirs<lb/> us to set up a standard of rebellion against religion&#44;<lb/> in others&#44; lurking passions aid the hidden cause which<lb/> breeds defection and dishonesty.  And if such is<lb/> our human condition of life during every stage of life&#44; how<lb/> much more exposed to those perils it must needs be<lb/> at an age when the buoyancy of spirits prevails&#44;<lb/> and the will has not been brought under control&#63;<lb/>  Wisely have therefore the Sages of Israel written&#44; that<lb/> we should not trust ourselves until the day of our death.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>When man has reached the full term of his earthly existence<lb/> and has unswervedly continued upright&#44; then may<lb/> the servant of God proclaim aloud that the deceased aloud was<lb/> righteous&#44; then he may tell that the departed had<lb/> lived to a purpose&#44; that he had <sic>benefitted</sic> society<lb/> by his example.  Moses Hoog&#44; whose death<lb/> we deplore&#44; had not attained the age of maturity.<lb/>  That the directors of the institution which sought his<lb/> welfare&#44; speak favorably of this youth&#44; shows that<lb/> his past record has been good&#59; that the family under<lb/> whose roof he dwelt&#44; bore him affection&#44; proves<lb/> that he possessed sterling qualities&#44; that his em&#45;<lb/>&#45;ployers sincerely lament the loss sustained&#44; signi&#45;<lb/>&#45;fies that he was trust&#45;worthy&#44; capable and amia&#45;<lb/>&#45;ble.  And those virtues&#44; thus early exhibited&#44; will<lb/> win for hi ma share in that eternal inheritance&#44;<lb/> which we mortals cannot describe nor conceive&#44; but<lb/> which must be great and glorious&#44; as He is great and<lb/> glorious who created man&#39;s distinguishing characteristic&#45;&#45;<lb/>our intellectual soul.  But as our brother<lb/> departed hence so young&#44; and we cannot divine what<lb/> his future would have been&#44; in a spiritual sense&#44; we ought<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>not to waste time in sulking for laudations&#44; but<lb/> rather employ it to improve the sad occasion by ur&#45;<lb/>&#45;ging the living to goodness and piety.<lb/></p>
            <p>Ah my young friends&#33;  Life is a precious gift from<lb/> God&#44; and we should use it as an object over the preserva&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of which we must watch with exceeding care.<lb/>  To trifle with it&#44; to impair it&#44; to endanger it is a<lb/> grievous sin.  Nothing but duty should induce<lb/> us temporarily to set aside the wants of the body&#59;<lb/> and who does not know how very very closely con&#45;<lb/>&#45;nected is our physical health with the state of our mind&#63;<lb/>  The latter specially we should guard against its becoming di&#45;<lb/>&#45;seased by evil thoughts and feelings.<lb/></p>  
            <p>I am the last to advise seclusion as a means to re&#45;<lb/>&#45;main untainted by the contact of vicious companions.<lb/>  I am the last to advise ignorance as a shield against dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;turbing doubts and skepticism.  No&#44; it is our destiny<lb/> to associate with our fellow&#45;creatures&#44; but let us be chary<lb/> in the choice of friends&#44; we obey a natural impulse<lb/> in unfolding the books which lay before our views vision notions<lb/> to which we had been heretofore strangers&#44; but we should<lb/> be careful of the serpent in the field of science and literature&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>we should not accept what endangers the soundness<lb/> of our religious principles&#59; even the wholesome idea which<lb/> Judaism always sets forth.  God and His revealed<lb/> will word&#44; as enunciated by Moses&#44; and as told in the sect&#45;<lb/>ion read last Sabbath.  The heavens&#44; and the<lb/> heavens of heavens the earth and all the fulness<lb/> thereof are the Lord&#39;s&#44; but he manifested Himlsl<lb/> Himself and His will to us for our happiness&#39; sake.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>Such is my counsel to the youths of this age&#44; and<lb/> would I could influence thousands of Jewish lads in America<lb/> who&#44; mistaking the blessed born of liberty for license&#44; defy public<lb/> opinion&#44; scoff at the wisdom gathered from experience&#44; and finally<lb/> lose that balance which would have helped them up straight in<lb/> body and mind.  To you my dear children who enjoy<lb/> the advantage of a home in whose atmosphere you breathe in pu&#45;<lb/>rity&#44; I say&#58; indulge in amusements&#44; but be prudent in selecting<lb/> the exercises which will add to your strength&#59; study diligently&#44;<lb/> but avoid what might pervert your understanding&#59; be simple&#45;<lb/>&#45;hearted&#44; warm&#45;natured&#44; enthusiastic&#44; generous&#44; but above all hope&#45;<lb/>in Him who is the Primary source of life&#59; the Fountain&#45;head of veri&#45;<lb/>&#45;table pleasures.  &#40;Here follows a prayer&#41;.<lb/></p>
