            <p>Rev. S. Morais&#44;<lb/>
                Dear Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>I was<lb/> in hopes to have finished all<lb/> the Soct details&#44; paying<lb/> bills&#44; etc before today&#44; and<lb/> to have sent by todays<lb/> mail a full account of<lb/> the little &#91;&#63;&#93; congr of the<lb/> deceased &#38; his few last<lb/> days&#44; here at North Creek&#59;<lb/> but find it impossible&#44;<lb/> as the Conductor to whom<lb/> we ent&#91;&#63;&#93; his return<lb/> ticket&#44; found in his<lb/> pocket book&#44; will not be<lb/> able to see it until an<lb/> opportunity occurs at<lb/> Saratoga&#34;&#34;we thought it<lb/> would be better to convert<lb/></p>

            <p>it into money.<lb/></p>
            <p>It was while only passing<lb/> thro&#39; this place North River&#44;<lb/> at this &#91;&#63;&#93; my mother&#39;s<lb/> attention was drawn towards<lb/> Mr. Weissenstein&#44; as being<lb/> so very weak &#38; ill&#44; and<lb/> without a soul to take<lb/> care of him&#44; &#38; needing it<lb/> every moment.  She was<lb/> as kind as a mother to<lb/> him&#44; trying to persuade<lb/> him to return to Philadelphia<lb/>&#45;&#45;this was ten days or more<lb/> ago.  He was determined<lb/> to go on against the advice<lb/> of doctors and everybody.  I<lb/> did go fifteen miles further<lb/> into the wits&#44; but returned<lb/> a week later to North Creek<lb/> to be nearer Dr. Martine.<lb/>  As you perhaps know&#44; it<lb/> is very rough here&#44; but<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>he had the best care<lb/> possible at a private<lb/> house.  The man &#38; his wife<lb/> taking charge.  My mother<lb/> went down nearly every<lb/> day to see him&#44; which<lb/> seemed to give him his<lb/> only pleasure about&#44; for<lb/> he was apparently very<lb/> grateful for her sympathy<lb/> &#38; interest&#59; The tears<lb/> filling his eyes at times&#44; &#38;<lb/> once telling her he would<lb/> pray for her.  It was<lb/> while here he confided to<lb/> my mother who he was&#44;<lb/> giving her your &#38; his<lb/> mother&#39;s address&#44; by her<lb/> advice&#44; in case of his<lb/> death&#59; also wished his<lb/> body sent to you&#44; with<lb/> all effects.  It was<lb/> a great responsibility &#38;<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>a very sad duty&#44; but she<lb/> performed it as faithfully<lb/> as if it were a relative.<lb/>  We did not see him die&#44;<lb/> unfortunately&#44; but went<lb/> down.  N. Creek is five<lb/> miles from N. River&#34;&#34;Soon<lb/> after packed everything into<lb/> his bags.  Some of this keys<lb/> are enclosed in other bags&#44;<lb/> &#38; two small ones forwarded<lb/> in a letter&#44; which I trust<lb/> you have received.<lb/></p>
            <p>The body was sent from N.<lb/> Creek by 3. 30 P. M. train<lb/> on Saturday the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> August&#44;<lb/> it should have reached Phil.<lb/> Sunday&#44; but we received<lb/> your telegram saying not<lb/> so&#59; <del>but</del> it only reached<lb/> us Monday morning &#38; by<lb/> that time we knew it<lb/> must have arrived&#44; being<lb/> detained in N. York probably<lb/> over Sunday&#59; we have<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="5"/>
            <p>however the express receipt&#44;<lb/> <del>and bills etc&#44;</del> which insures<lb/> its safety&#34;&#34;and the body<lb/> was wrapped in a sheet<lb/> saturated with carbolic acid.<lb/>  So we think it will not<lb/> suffer much by the added<lb/> time of delay.  In his<lb/> pocket book was found<lb/> eighty two dollars&#59; &#40;&#36;82.00&#41;<lb/> by his request we sent<lb/> his body in as nice a<lb/> coffin as could be<lb/> procured in so short a<lb/> time.  The little bouquet<lb/> inside being the last thing<lb/> he smiled at&#44; a day or<lb/> two before he died&#44; seeing<lb/> to please him.  The<lb/> woman who took care of<lb/> him last&#44; says he died<lb/> at 10.30. A. M.&#44; very easily<lb/> breathing shorter &#38; shorter&#59;<lb/> apparently conscious to the last&#58;<lb/></p>
