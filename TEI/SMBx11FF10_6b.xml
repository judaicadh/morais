            <p>a funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  Let those who desire to be shown a striking illustration of the uncertainty<lb/> of life&#44; gaze upon this coffin.  The mortal remains <sic>incased</sic> therein&#44; are not<lb/> those of a man bent down with years&#59; nor those of one whose bodily infirmities<lb/> betoken an early dissolution.  When the angel of death summoned Isaac E.<lb/> Hackenburg to the tribunal of the Great Judge&#44; he was in the most vigorous<lb/> stage of human existence.  Free from distempers premonitory of an approaching<lb/> end&#44; he anticipated no doubt a long enjoyment of earthly delights.  He natu&#45;<lb/>&#45;rally conceived that he would still be suffered to strive after the preferments<lb/> and honors which the world bestows....O ye&#44; thoughtless youths that rely upon<lb/> your own strength&#44; for the compassing of your schemes&#33;  Ye all that are<lb/> whisked away in the mad dance of life&#44; those regardless pause an instant<lb/> and reflect.  Why such haste in gathering chaff&#44; which a puff of wind drives<lb/> away&#63;  Why will you bow at the shrine of idols of gold and silver&#44; and forget<lb/> Him&#44; whom you owe infinite thanks for every breath you draw&#63;  Had He in his<lb/> infinite boundless goodness destined you even to outlive even the period allotted to man&#44; you would<lb/> still look back upon the years that sank into eternity&#44; as on a passing shadow.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>But what of your terrestrial pilgrimage were suddenly to terminate ere one half of it<lb/> was accomplished&#63;  What&#44; if like our lamented brother&#44; you were to be cut off unawares&#63;<lb/>  Take&#44; my friends&#33; Think&#44; my friends&#44; &#38; take the admonition of the ancient moralist at to heart.  &#34;Remember<lb/> your Creator in the days of your youth&#44; before the evil days time arrives&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;when man goeth to his long home&#44; and the mourners walk around<lb/> in the streets.&#34;  Or&#44; rather as the Teachers of Israel recommend with equal em&#45; solicitude<lb/> &#45;phasis &#34;Repent one day before your death&#34;.  Human foresight2 and human<lb/> wisdom1 cannot descry the approaching of that sword that will which severs the mortal<lb/> from the immortal&#59; be therefore prepared always for to meet the issue&#44; through a life<lb/> consonant with the rules of morality and religion.  In many respects the de&#45;<lb/>&#45;portment of our deceased friend&#44; during his short career&#44; may well serve to you for<lb/> a pattern worthy of imitation.  His filial reverence&#44; the lively interest<lb/> he evinced in the welfare of his needy fellow&#45;believers.  His desire for mental<lb/> and spiritual improvement.  His love for Judaism in the abstract&#44; and the lo esti&#45;<lb/>&#45;mation in which he held those he sincerely deemed the best exponent thereof&#44; were his prominent<lb/> and praiseworthy commendable characteristics.  That his mind occasionally mind misjudged&#44; and that he<lb/></p> 
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>practically failed to carry out the last injunction of his righteous parent&#44; was<lb/> more the effect of circumstances than a <sic>wilful</sic> perversion of the mind heart.  A long<lb/> absence from a home&#44; where piety reigned&#44; and too close a contact with individuals&#44;<lb/> who would arrogantly cause the new&#45;fangled notions to supersede the word<lb/> of God&#44; alienated estranged him heart somewhat from some of the time&#45;honored practices of Israel.<lb/>  His mind became unfortunately tinctured with untenable doctrines now seized upon with avidity by<lb/> the unwary among our coreligionists.  But had a longer existence been<lb/> vouchsafed to him&#44; I have reasons to believe&#44; that he would have fully discovered<lb/> his error&#44; and shaped his conduct after the model exhibited by the Sages of<lb/> our people.  Oh may He whose inscrutable decree called him hence&#44; forgive<lb/> the trespasses of the son for the sake of the merits acquired by his righteous godly sainted father.  May He<lb/> whose highest attribute is mercy&#44; regard only the virtues that adorned our deceased<lb/> brother.  May the fervent prayers of those he left upon earth to bemoan<lb/> his untimely loss&#44; propitiate for him the favor of the Most High Almighty&#44; and gain for his soul<lb/> a seat among the blessed&#44; and a durable glory &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> May He go in peace&#44; may he rest in his final couch&#44; as he that hath walked uprightly before<lb/> God.&#34;  Amen.<lb/></p>
