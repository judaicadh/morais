            <p>1214 Master St Philadelphia August 31. 1890.<lb/>
                Rev. S. Morais&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>Respected Sir&#59;<lb/></p>
            <p>Although to wield the pen&#44; is a task&#44; yet injustice to my<lb/> feelings I make the sacrifice.  A friend handed me for perusal &#34;Disaffections against the Jews&#34;<lb/> and having lived among Non&#45;Israelites for 36 years&#44; and had contact only with Christians&#44; I can speak<lb/> by experience&#44; why there is a hatred against the Jew&#44; and forever of good&#44; incontrovertible reasons.<lb/>  1. Does the Jew act with becoming respect in attending Worship services in the Synagogue&#63;  The devout&#44;<lb/> still &#38; attentive in the House dedicated to God &#38; does his conduct harmonize with the time &#38; <sic>occassion</sic>&#63;<lb/>  I have to my sore grief seen laughter &#38; constant chatting going on during service.  The christian is<lb/> punctual &#38; decorous&#44; the Jew comes ad libitum&#44; regardless of annoyance to Audience or Divine.<lb/>  The christian goes to &#38; from Church in a quiet&#44; respectful manner&#44; how does the Jew act&#63;&#95;&#95;&#95;<lb/>  Go with me to a Summer resort&#44; and by their overbearing manner&#44; bold &#38; unrestrained conduct<lb/> they arouse the feelings of all civilized society.&#95;Whilst I had my wife &#38; daughter at Newport&#44; R. I..<lb/> two years ago&#44; I formed the acquaintance of a gentleman from St Louis&#44; a R. R. Magnate&#44; one who<lb/> has <sic>travelled</sic> a great deal &#38; observes as he goes through the world.  When he discovered my plan of go&#45;<lb/>ing to the White Mountains&#44; he warned me&#44; not to stop at &#34;Fabians&#34; as the N. Y. <hi rend="underline">Jews had charge &#38; possession</hi>.<lb/>  I met the same gentleman afterwards in Sarartoga&#44; and he passed the same remark of &#34;Congress Hall.&#34;&#95;<lb/> &#34;A good presence is a letter of recommendation.&#34;  Not arrogance&#44; vanity&#44; haughtiness&#44; <hi rend="underline">noise &#38; ill manners</hi>.&#45;<lb/>  Does the Jew like work&#44; and earn his bread by the sweat of his face&#63;  How many carpenters&#44; masons&#44; painters<lb/> laborers &#38; brick layers do you find in this grand City&#63;  Does the Jew like mechanics&#44; agriculture&#44; farming&#63;<lb/>  Are not our streets &#38; highways full of hawkers&#44; <sic>peddlars</sic>&#44; Agents&#44; drummers &#38; <sic>travelling</sic> salesmen&#63;&#95;<lb/>  How many Israelites are to be found in Baldwin&#39;s Works&#63;  Who ever saw a Jew build a house or a Barn&#63;<lb/>  I have done all kinds of hard work&#44; carted stone&#44; brick&#44; and all kinds of building materials.<lb/>  I have gathered wood&#45;ashes to put on my farm&#44; and carted manure to enrich the soil.&#95;<lb/></p>

            <p>A man in any station can do his duty&#45;&#45;and doing it&#45;&#45;can earn his own respect. . . .<lb/> Your conduct between employers &#38; employees during the last months is commendable&#44; as an<lb/> intercessor you did noble service&#44; for blessed are the peacemakers.  But has not the manager the<lb/> right &#38; privilege to get his work done&#44; where &#38; by whom it is to his advantage&#63;  Men leave their<lb/> native country&#44; to enjoy our liberty &#38; freedom.  They soon forget oppression &#38; persecution&#45;&#45;<lb/> when scarce able to speak our language&#44; they foment mischief&#44; uproar&#44; strife and commotion.<lb/>  Strikes seem to be contagious&#44; an epidemic throughout this broad&#44; beautiful land of ours&#44; unless<lb/> the employee&#39;s will be done&#44; right or wrong&#45;&#45;the first thing resorted to&#44; is to strike&#44; strike&#44; strike.<lb/>  Why don&#39;t some of the rugged young men go out in the country to help the farmer&#44; builder&#44; lumberdealer&#63;<lb/>  You see &#91;&#63;&#93; youths innumerable standing &#38; walking through our public streets&#44; trying to eke out a<lb/> subsistence in selling shoe strings&#44; eye glasses&#44; stationary&#44; <sic>confectionary</sic>&#44; toys &#38; ad infinitum&#45;&#45;they would<lb/> fare better to improve their time &#38; talent by following a trade or labor <del>giving</del> weeding opportunities<lb/> If we prepare for work&#44; and <hi rend="underline">earnestly</hi> desire to have it&#45;&#45;it will come.  As citizens of a common country&#44;<lb/> as followers of the ancient mosaic faith&#44; we should all join together in the doing of good acts&#44; &#38;<lb/> in taking an interest in the welfare&#44; and advancement of society at large.  When these things<lb/> happen&#44; and the clergy and laity join in such measures&#44; working heart to heart&#44; &#38; shoulder to shoulder<lb/> in inculcating morality&#44; industry and the well&#45;being of society&#44; <hi rend="underline">in fair dealing between man</hi>&#44;<lb/> and man&#44; in the due performance of all obligations to society then the congregation is in a <hi rend="underline">good</hi><lb/> condition.  If we want others to respect us&#44; we must deserve and merit respect&#44; in our<lb/> daily acts&#44; in the streets&#44; in the counting house&#44; <hi rend="underline">ignore deception&#44; fraud and conspiracy</hi>&#44;<lb/> conduct ourselves mannerly &#38; respectfully in the house of God&#44; at social gather&#45;<lb/>ings&#44; in the house of mourning&#44; in the graveyard&#44; wherever life&#39;s duties or pleasures<lb/> &#38; inclinations take our presence let us do our duty as humble children of God.<lb/>  That our conduct and actions may obtain for us grace&#44; favor and benevolence in the<lb/> sight of Jehovah&#44; and in the sight of all mankind.  Amen.&#45;&#45;Respectfully<lb/> Jacob Tuck<lb/></p>
