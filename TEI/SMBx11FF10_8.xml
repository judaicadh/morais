            <p>Funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>My friends&#33;  For upwards of a quarter of a century&#44; our brother&#44;<lb/> whose lifeless form now lies before us&#44; was incapacitated from pursuing<lb/> his the career&#44; that nature has ordained for us all here below&#44; and<lb/> which is thus described by the inspired Psalmist &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Man will go forth to his work&#44; and to his labor until evening&#34;<lb/> Stricken with a direful distemper&#44; he was cut off from that daily<lb/> communion with the world&#44; which while it promotes physical and<lb/> moral health&#44; benefits society at large.  But though long led<lb/> in comparative solitude&#44; the life of Barnet Ellynge affords the<lb/> survivors a noble lesson.  I have heard many&#44; when affected<lb/> by some temporary evils&#44; raise a voice of lament and call existence an<lb/> insupportable burthen&#59; our brother&#44; my beloved hearers&#33; afflicted<lb/> with an incurable disease&#44; neither chafed nor murmured against<lb/> the disposition of Providence.  It was the remark of those who<lb/> visited him to cheer his loneliness&#44; that the paralysis of the body<lb/> had not palsied the mind&#44; nor chilled the heart.  Jovial he was&#44;<lb/> and extremely communicative.  He evinced unabated interest concern<lb/> in current events&#44; and that which particularly related to<lb/> the welfare of his coreligionists&#44; excited his most lively<lb/> interest.  But do you know&#44; my friends&#33; whence our deceased<lb/> brother derived his serenity and strength amid his sore trials&#63;<lb/>  He drew them from his consciousness of the justice and<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>wisdom of the Supreme.  Often adverting to his former<lb/> prosperity&#44; and sound health&#44; he would acknowledge that<lb/> the Lord of goodness had not chastened deprived him thereof without a cause&#44;<lb/> and in the language of Job&#44; he would exclaim &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;The Lord hath given&#44; and the Lord hath taken&#44; may His<lb/> name be ever blessed&#34;.  But the Dweller in heaven who<lb/> beheld his resignation accounted it righteousness&#44; and<lb/> charged an angel to watch over his protracted existence.<lb/>  She who had delighted in his happiness&#45;&#45;the wife of his<lb/> bosom&#45;&#45;became the his tutelary guardian during the years of<lb/> sorrow.  Who shall adequately portray her the unflinching<lb/> devotion of that virtuous woman&#63;  I will not attempt<lb/> it&#44; lest I do her noble actions injustice&#59; but with uplifted hands<lb/> I will beseech the Master of compassions &#91;Hebrew&#93; to bestow<lb/> upon her the blessings she most needs&#45;&#45;mental <sic>tranquillity</sic>&#44;<lb/> and a future of uninterrupted ease and comfort among her<lb/> surviving f relatives and sympathising friends.  And may<lb/> He also vouchsafe to hearken unto the supplications which we<lb/> will jointly pour forth for the spiritual eternal salvation of our lamented<lb/> brother.  May He say unto the spirit &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Come in peace&#44; rest upon the allotted place&#44;<lb/> and as he who hath walked uprightly before God&#34;.  May this<lb/> be his gracious will&#59; and let us say.  Amen.<lb/></p>
