                <p>&#34;The Jewish Sabbath Observance Association&#44;&#34; is the title<lb/> given to an object thoroughly good&#44; as viewed from<lb/> the standpoint of religious consistency.  To accomplish<lb/> that object&#44; two important meetings were recently<lb/> held&#44; and another will be called for next week.<lb/>  It is fitting that the Jewish Theological Seminary&#44;<lb/> solemnly pledged to raise defenders to Holy Writ&#44; as<lb/> traditionally received&#44; should arrive bring together into its<lb/> consecrated building our New York brethren&#44; who are eager<lb/> to declare save the fourth commandment of the Decalogue<lb/> from the scandal of extinction.  I have read the<lb/> proceedings of the meetings with unusual interest and I anxiously<lb/> look for a final result.  Would that my<lb/> mind responded to the wishes of my heart&#33;  My<lb/> thanks to the prime movers of the blissful blessed proposition&#44;<lb/> would be the warmest which ever emanated from<lb/> my inmost soul.  Relying on the efficacy of a<lb/> pious example&#44; I might have just reasons to an&#45;<lb/>&#45;ticipate a close imitation of it in Philadelphia.  If<lb/> merchant princes in the great metropolis&#44; counting its<lb/> Hebrew population by the hundreds of thousands&#44; were<lb/></p>

                <p>palpably to show that God did not deliver His<lb/> most solemn binding declaration at Sinai to be divided by posterity&#44; our people<lb/> in large centres might shame misleading leaders&#44; who<lb/> preach the impossibility of keeping the historical Sab&#45;<lb/>&#45;bath in busy America.  But my zeal for the<lb/> cause is dampened by the records of the past.  Some<lb/> decades ago&#44; a Sabbath league was entered into among<lb/> rich Israelites of our neighboring city.  Those who<lb/> headed it are not all dead.  The survivors could<lb/> tell of the enthusiasm which the project aroused.<lb/>  Physicians and lawyers&#44; generally the busiest  of<lb/> men&#44; promised to reduce their practice within a<lb/> compass as narrow as compatible with their callings&#44;<lb/> in order to sanctify&#44; partly at least&#44; the day of the Decalogue.<lb/>  The healthful influence grew further.  In the<lb/> West&#44; a similar alliance was contracted.  It lasted&#44;<lb/> so long as none entrenched upon it&#44; but no sooner greed&#44;<lb/> or an outside pressure&#44; or the fear of being supplanted<lb/> by the less scrupulous&#44; made a pre breach in the league&#44;<lb/> than it became a loose chain&#44; beyond the chance of<lb/> fastening its rings once again together.  What hap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pened in Cincinnati occurred in New York&#59; hence&#44;<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="5"/>
                <p>I surmise&#44; arose a novel institution in the shape of Friday<lb/> evening late services.  It was argued that if Israelites<lb/> cannot bring their material interest as an offering to<lb/> the Sabbath&#44; they might be willing to sacrifice amuse&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments&#44; the theatre&#44; and the concert and the ball&#45;&#45;to listen to synago&#45;<lb/>&#45;gue hymns and a sermon.  I may be short sighted&#44;<lb/> but I could not see in the same light what my<lb/> colleagues considered a token of respect to the Decalogue.<lb/>  I objected to seconding the idea of greeting the sabbath queen&#59;<lb/> long after the parting sun has bid her come in to her faithful subject in peace<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;  I objected to my people coreligionists calling sabbath obser&#45;<lb/>&#45;vance&#44; what is a thinly disguised deception.  But<lb/> another reflection held me back from sanctioning that<lb/> illegitimate compromise.  Friday evenings at<lb/> home can best promote the ends of the Jewish faith.<lb/>  An air of sanctity pervades the domestic hearth&#44; when<lb/> parents and their offspring remain in doors&#44; even sitting<lb/> longer than usual at the family board&#44; enjoying a<lb/> meal&#44; preceded and followed by prayers and psalmody.<lb/>  They&#44; as the Rabbis figuratively put it&#44; angels are invited<lb/> to enter the abode of tranquility &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>

                <p>In my judgment&#44; neither the mellifluousness harmony of vocal<lb/> and instrumental music&#44; nor the eloquence of a speaker&#44;<lb/> can supply the place of that real sabbath keeping.  I<lb/> may be pardoned for assuming the role of a critic&#44;<lb/> but according to my mode of thinking&#44; late Friday<lb/> evening Sabbath religious meetings set a premium on Sabbath breaking.<lb/>  They tacitly say to Israelites who absent themselves<lb/> from the Divine services upon the Sabbath day&#58; &#34;Be at<lb/> ease&#59; your conscience has no cause for self&#45;reproach.  You<lb/> have entirely fulfilled your duty&#34;&#45;&#45;a teaching offensive to<lb/> the code of morals&#44; because very false.  No&#58; the duty has<lb/> not been fulfilled&#44; by giving an hour to the Synagogue&#44; when at perfect<lb/> leisure&#44; as a substitute for the commandment which<lb/> we have read this morning &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;But the seventh day is the Sabbath unto the Lord<lb/> thy God.  In it thou shalt not do any work.&#34;  Now&#44;<lb/> the well meaning Israelites who convened in New York at<lb/> the building of the Jewish Theological Seminary&#44; are evident<lb/>&#45;ly loth to stamp their &#91;&#63;&#93; movement with a lie.  Some would<lb/> testify to the genuineness of their intention&#44; by declaring ine&#45;<lb/>&#45;ligible as members of the designed association&#44; Israelites<lb/> who do not now observe the Sabbath.  Others&#44; again&#44;<lb/></p>

Meanwhile&#44; I<lb/> frankly confess my misgivings&#44; as to the ultimate issue.<lb/>  What failed in its scope three decades ago&#44; when the Sunday&#45;<lb/>services abomination had not yet been concocted&#44; is not<lb/> likely to succeed now that many of our youths have<lb/> become demoralized&#44; under the unJewish impression<lb/> that &#34;the Sabbath was made for man and not man<lb/> for the Sabbath&#44;&#34; as the new testament asserts&#44; and that consequently to rest after our<lb/> worldly pursuits do not demand our attention any<lb/> longer&#44; is agreeable to reason and acceptable to the<lb/> Sinaic Legislator.  To my clerical colleagues of New York&#44;<lb/> who have urged the necessity of trying to save the en&#45;<lb/>&#45;joined Sabbath&#44; exposed to the danger of Christianization&#44;<lb/> which calls the Lord&#39;s day&#44; what is a man&#45;god&#39;s day&#59; to<lb/> my lay brethren of New York&#44; who in good faith believe<lb/> that &#91;Hebrew&#93; it is time to work for the<lb/> Lord&#44; as our people have set the Law to nothing&#59; to all<lb/> who have assembled twice and will assemble again at<lb/> the building of the Jewish Theological Seminary to<lb/> rescue from extinction what Moses&#44; the prophets&#44; our<lb/></p>

Nay&#44; I greatly appre&#45;<lb/>&#45;hend that an abortive attempt at present&#44; may<lb/> prove a set back fatal to the holy undertaking.<lb/>  It may be quoted hereafter to their support by men<lb/> who teach that&#44; the fourth commandment&#44; treasured<lb/> up as an everlasting agreement between the Creator<lb/> and His covenant people&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93; is an utter impossibility in<lb/> busy America.  Well then&#58; Am I<lb/> hopeless&#63;  Not altogether.  My looks are rivet&#45;<lb/>&#45;ted upon the structure&#44; in which the meetings for the<lb/> resuscitation of the Sabbath has been recently held.<lb/>  If but a few of the students whom we strive to im&#45;<lb/>&#45;bue with righteous sentiments&#44; will respond to the<lb/> constant appeals for loyalty to the Torah&#59; if those<lb/> for whose broad instruction we have just now pro&#45;<lb/>cured a rich and valuable library&#44; will learn fidelity<lb/></p>

For&#44; it is the<lb/> vacillating character of some ministers&#44; their hankering<lb/> after popularity&#44; however ill wrongly acquired&#44; that brought<lb/> on Philadelphia a crisis&#44; culminating in the unblush&#45;<lb/>ing sanction given to the virtual abolition of the<lb/> Sabbath and with it of dietary laws&#44; of feasts and<lb/> fasts and of the Hebrew language&#44; each and all<lb/> intended to perpetuate Israel and Israelitism.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Take care of children raised<lb/> in lowliness&#44; for they will uphold Judaism&#44;&#34; say<lb/> the Rabbis.

It is due<lb/> also to my Philadelphia brethren&#44; who have tangibly<lb/> aided me in my struggle for a God&#45;approved reform&#44;<lb/> and it is highly profoundly due to the memory of blessed ones here<lb/> and elsewhere&#44; who turned a generous thought towards<lb/> the Jewish Theological Seminary&#44; while making<lb/> provisions for the time&#44; when they would be called<lb/> from earth to heaven.  May none among the living<lb/> nor among the dead be given occasion to regret their<lb/> confiding trust.  In the words of Isaiah&#44; which we<lb/> have read on this suggestive Sabbath I now pray&#58; if but<lb/> a tenth be yet remaining&#44; and that also be lopped off and<lb/> pruned&#44; may enough be still left&#44; to root into the Jewish<lb/> soil a seed that will bring forth a holy plant imperishable.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
