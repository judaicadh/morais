            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen.  Last year During last winter you were shown<lb/> a tableau&#44; representing&#44; with fair consecutiveness&#44; re&#45;<lb/>&#45;markable events and their leading actors in the his&#45;<lb/>&#45;tory of our people.  &#182; To describe A delineation of the causes which<lb/> invited a foreign enemy to the land of the patriarchs&#44;<lb/> and drove its inhabitants into captivity&#59; a description of the trials of endured<lb/> by the priestly Seer of Anathoth&#44; who foretold the na&#45;<lb/>&#45;tional downfall under the all&#45;conquering Nebuchadnez&#45;<lb/>&#45;zar&#44; and strove&#44; in vain&#44; to Cessen&#44; by his wise counsel&#44;<lb/> the attending horrors&#59; a cheering account of the return of a few&#44; but spi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ritually improved&#44; Judeans to the ancient heritage&#59;<lb/> and the successful endeavours of Ezra&#45;&#45;the resuscita&#45;<lb/>&#45;tor of pure Mosaism&#45;&#45;&#44; was constituted the first portion of the<lb/> task assigned to him who has the honor of addressing<lb/> you this evening.  Then&#44; one of my reverend col&#45;<lb/>&#45;leagues brought vividly before our vision the strug&#45;<lb/>&#45;gles of the restored exiles to maintain the inde&#45;<lb/>&#45;pendence of their laws and worship&#59; the check<lb/> put by the heroic Asmoneans to an seductive and captivating attractive but<lb/> undermining apostacy seductive cultivation of the beautiful in nature and art.  His two graphic delineations pictures<lb/> pictured represented a canker&#45;worm&#44; in the shape of the perfidious<lb/></p>

            <p>Idumean&#44; gnawing the body politic&#59; the virtual<lb/> overthrow of the Herodian dynasty&#59; the crushing<lb/> blow which lay Judea prostrate at the feet of<lb/> of Rome&#59; and the birth of Christianity&#44; soon to cast<lb/> off its swaddling cloths to go forth and carry<lb/> abroad fire and sword.  &#182;  The Minister who&#44; to<lb/> favor us&#44; journeyed from another state&#44; portrayed the<lb/> rising of schools in the country to which our an&#45;<lb/>&#45;cestors&#45;&#45;mainly the tribes of Judah and Benjamin&#45;&#45;had once been banished&#44; and the spread of<lb/> learning in that distant clime&#44; long after dire per&#45;<lb/>&#45;secutions compelled the closing of Palestenian Aca&#45;<lb/>&#45;demies.  He edified and entertained the audience<lb/> with the narrative of incidents in the lives of pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;minent Gaons&#44; or Presidents of colleges in cities wa&#45;<lb/>&#45;tered by the Euphrates&#59; and laid open to our con&#45;<lb/>&#45;templation the channel&#44; through which&#44;&#45;&#45;in his opi&#45;<lb/>&#45;nion&#45;&#45;&#44; the vast literature created in Babylon&#44; was flowed<lb/> transformed down into Spain.  As a sequel to that<lb/> attractive sketch&#44; I was privileged to offer a bird&#39;s eye<lb/> view of the height gained by our ancestors in the<lb/> Iberian peninsula&#44; when Andalusia felt the genial<lb/> influence of a chivalrous and politic race&#44; the Moors<lb/></p>

I purpose trespas&#45;<lb/>&#45;sing on your indulgence&#44; while I try my feeble<lb/> hand at filling up that void&#44; partly at least&#44; with<lb/> a few light strokes.  And&#44; fearing that I may&#44;<lb/> reasonably&#44; be suspected of self plagiarism&#44; I beg<lb/> to assure my hearers that  I have not at all asked imposed suppressed every inclination to look<lb/> at a series of articles I wrote years ago&#44; for a Jewish<lb/> periodical&#44; on Hebrew literature in Italy.  I do not<lb/> at all remember their exact contents diction&#59; scarcely can I recall any of the ideas advanced&#44; nor will I advance set forth but<lb/> a single illustration form among the several I brought<lb/> forward on that occasion.  For though flattered &#40;beyond<lb/> my wildest anticipations&#44; by having been asked to dis&#45; by having been twice accorded again the privilege of opening<lb/> &#45;cuss a theme which would appeal the ripest scholars&#41; the course of Jewish lectures and speak at length&#44;<lb/> I may openly candidly tell that my minds warns me against<lb/> attempting too much.  To principally prove that the Hebrew lan&#45;<lb/>&#45;guage was &#91;&#63;&#93; as a medium to treat of sciences&#44; was first early cultivated&#44; and first employed for treating of science&#44;<lb/> employed by Jews of Italy&#44; is the extent of my am&#45;<lb/>&#45;bition.<lb/></p>

            <p>of the days of their immortal Abdalrahman and<lb/> Alhachem.  And my microscopic presentation&#44; pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;pared the unfolding of another&#44; wide and comprehen&#45;<lb/>&#45;sive&#44; which the skilful pencil of a Philadelphia<lb/> Divine drew.  In it we beheld a mind&#44; which&#44; having<lb/> fathomed the philosophy of the Sage of Cordova&#44; and<lb/> dived into the researches of Castilian Sages&#44; arose with<lb/> a giant&#39;s strength&#44; to build up an era&#45;&#45;the Mendels&#45;<lb/>&#45;sohnean era.  &#182; But in that tableau&#44; which<lb/> the designers must have doubtless wished to render as com&#45;<lb/>&#45;plete&#44; as a limited space would allow&#44; a gap was<lb/> unaccountably left.  All eyes&#45;&#45;after having wept<lb/> over the tragic end of the country of our fathers&#45;&#45;&#44; should<lb/> have been directed to the spot&#44; where to unhallowed<lb/> hands carried the hallowed vessels of the house of<lb/> God.
