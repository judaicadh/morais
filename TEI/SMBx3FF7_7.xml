            <p>ORTHODOX TRUSTEES ELECTED.<lb/> 
                A BLACK EYE FOR REFORM IN THE SHEARITH<lb/> 
                ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE.<lb/></p>
            <p>By the election of three Trustee last<lb/> night the members of the Shearith Israel Syna&#45;<lb/>gogue&#44; in Nineteenth&#45;street&#44; felt that the future<lb/> fate of their congregation was to be decided.<lb/> The synagogue has of late been divided into two<lb/> very formidable factions representing the ortho&#45;<lb/>dox and reform parties of the Jewish religion.<lb/> At the head of the orthodox faction are the<lb/> most influential members of the congregation&#44;<lb/> families directly descended from the Marchardos&#44;<lb/> the Gomez&#44; the Peixotts&#44; and the Hendricks&#44; who<lb/> fled to this country during the time of the Span&#45;<lb/>ish Inquisition. They are in favor of  the<lb/> strict observance of the old Portuguese<lb/> Spanish ritual. At the head of the reform<lb/> party are the Allans&#44; the Blumenthals&#44; the<lb/> Nathans&#44; and the Sulzbergers&#44; who strenuously<lb/> demand that the synagogue shall be provided<lb/> with an organ&#44; and that the ladies of the congre&#45;<lb/>gation shall be seated with the gentlemen&#44; a con&#45;<lb/>dition which does not exist at present. But<lb/> these reformers do not uphold the ultra&#45;reform&#45;<lb/>er&#44; Rabbi Gottheil&#44; whose idea of changing the<lb/> Sabbath Day from Saturday to Sunday they re&#45;<lb/>gard as too radical an innovation for the pres&#45;<lb/>ent. &#34;My grandfather and my father have<lb/> never worked on Saturday&#44; and I never shall&#44;&#34;<lb/> said a member of the congregation to a TIMES<lb/> reporter last night&#44; &#34;not if all the Rabbi Gott&#45;<lb/>heils in the world introduce the measure. There<lb/> were two tickets for the election of three Trust&#45;<lb/>ees last night&#8212;the orthodox and reform tickets.<lb/></p>	
            <p>There are in all seven Trustees of the syna&#45;<lb/>gogue&#44; and as two of the four&#44; whose term has<lb/>not yet expired&#44; are of the reform party&#44; the<lb/> election of the reform ticket would have en&#45;<lb/>tirely altered the face of the congregation&#44;and<lb/> the present ministers&#44; the Rev. H.P. Mendes and<lb/> the Rev. D. Nicta&#44; would not have been re&#45;elected<lb/> at the expiration of their term. It was the in&#45;<lb/>tention of the reform party&#44; should they succeed<lb/> in electing their Trustees&#44; to advertise for new<lb/> reform ministers.  A big fight was therefore ex&#45;<lb/>pected last night&#44; and the members of the ortho&#45;<lb/>dox party were most of them crimson with ex&#45;<lb/>citement on their arrival upon the scene of the<lb/> controversy. Everything&#44; however&#44; went as<lb/> they wished. The opposition ticket was with&#45;<lb/>drawn&#44; and Messrs. L.N. Levy&#44; Tucker David&#44;<lb/> and David M. Piza  were elected by 56 votes&#8212;the<lb/> largest vote ever known in the synagogue.<lb/></p>
