            <p>Is faith or righteousness the way of salvation&#63;<lb/></p>

            <p>Brethren&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>What is the mission of the pulpit&#63;  I answer&#58; to furnish<lb/> society with men and women rich in virtue&#44; and to uphold<lb/> human beings in the pursuit of virtue&#44; by showing its<lb/> identity with abiding happiness.  It then follows&#44; that<lb/> to devote preaching exclusively or especially to the explaining<lb/> of dogmas&#44; is to misdirect the influence which the pulpit<lb/> ought to exercise.  For&#44; the bare knowledge of doctrines will<lb/> never befit men for the duties of life&#44; which the fulfilling of<lb/> which is&#44; after all&#44; religion vitalized&#44; religion practically<lb/> reduced to action.  Yet individuals who ought to be<lb/> deeply imbued with this irrefutable truth&#44; seem to ignore<lb/> it altogether.  From many a house of worship&#44; a<lb/> lament issues forth.  It is the voice of the officiating<lb/> minister that complains.  Not so much because cor&#45;<lb/>&#45;ruption in high circles shamelessly stalks abroad.  Not<lb/> so much because whole sections in our large cities are<lb/> infected with an atmosphere of vice and crime.  But<lb/> because men will&#44; forsooth&#44; forfeit eternal salvation by<lb/> refusing assent to that creed&#44; by rejecting the other<lb/> peculiar dogma.  Let us trust that in the<lb/></p>

            <p>vineyard of the Lord of Israel&#44; many such<lb/> laborers are not to be found.  That the Hebrew<lb/> ministry&#44; does not number many such members.<lb/>  For the Jewish shepherd&#44; who understands his calling&#44;<lb/> knows that Judaism does not make a life hereafter<lb/> to depend simply upon the acceptance of doctrines&#44;<lb/> but mainly on the performance of duties.  According<lb/> to its teaching&#44; not they who believed the most&#44; but<lb/> they who acted the best will share the largest reward.<lb/>  In fact&#44; my Brethren&#33; that grandest of all charts&#44;<lb/> the Decalogue&#44; does not impose dogmas.  It <sic>mereley</sic><lb/> imparts rules of conduct.  It is the remark of one<lb/> of our deepest thinkers&#44; that the document emanating<lb/> from the summit of Sinai&#44; does not say &#34;I am the only<lb/> everlasting God&#44; the creator of heaven and earth.  Believe<lb/> in me&#44; and you shall be saved.&#34;  But it begins thus.<lb/>  &#34;I am the Lord Thy God who brought thee out of the land of<lb/> Egypt&#44; out of the house of bondage&#44;&#34; meaning&#44; I am He<lb/> who has proved Himself Thy benefactor&#44; and as Thou owest<lb/> me gratitude&#44; therefore Thou shouldst worship me exclusively.<lb/>  Hence follows &#34;Thou shalt not have any other god before me&#34;<lb/> viz&#58; while I&#44; the Eternal&#44; am existing.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Even the acknowledgment of the Unity&#44; which it behooves<lb/> us daily to bear on our lips&#44; contains&#44; properly speaking&#44; no<lb/> declaration of faith.  Mark its words&#44; my brethren &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Hear O Israel&#44; Adona&#239; is our God&#44; Adona&#239;<lb/> is one&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; which in the original Hebrew conveys<lb/> the sense  both of hearing and understanding&#44; is the term<lb/> employed in the text.  Moses seeing his end approach&#44; called<lb/> upon the people&#44; whom he had&#44; during forty weary years in&#45;<lb/>&#45;structed&#44; to fit their minds for the reception of the all&#45;<lb/>important truth&#59; that the Divinity they worship&#45;&#45;Adona&#239;<lb/> the essence of goodness and mercy &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; is an indivisible<lb/> Unity.  And when after having sketched the history<lb/> of their past derelictions he addressed them regarding the<lb/> line of conduct they should follow&#44; he spoke in this manner.<lb/>  &#34;And now O Israel&#33; what does the Lord Thy God ask of thee&#63;<lb/>  But only to fear &#40;reverence&#41; the Lord Thy God&#44; to walk in<lb/> all his ways&#44; and to love him&#44; and to serve the Lord Thy God<lb/> with all thy heart and with all thy soul&#59; to keep<lb/> the commandments of the Lord and his statutes&#44; which I<lb/> command thee this day&#44; for thine own good&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>

            <p>Again&#44; making human happiness to result from<lb/> deeds of righteousness&#44; from practices which may create<lb/> a spiritual affinity&#44; as it were&#44; between man and God.<lb/>  I scarcely need quote in your presence the beautiful<lb/> description of the life of him who shall abide in the tents<lb/> of the Lord&#44; and dwell in His holy mountain&#58; and the<lb/> other equally sublime of the individual who shall ascend<lb/> the hill of the Most High&#44; and stand erect in His sacred<lb/> habitation.  The 15th and 24th psalms of David&#44; have<lb/> opened to your views that picture of the purest&#44; the noblest<lb/> of human characters&#44; because shapen in the mould of virtue.<lb/>  Nor can you have read unreflectingvely the delineation&#44;<lb/> which Isaiah in his impassioned eloquence has left&#44; of<lb/> the inhabitant of Zion&#44; who alone could escape the fiery<lb/> chastisement impending&#44; who would be uplifted on<lb/> impregnable rocks&#44; when all <sic>yeilded</sic> to a sweeping<lb/> destruction&#44; even of him who clings to righteousness&#44; and<lb/> speaks only uprightness&#44; who despises the wealth gotten by<lb/> fraud&#44; who shakes his hands that they may not hold<lb/> bribe&#44; who closes his ears that they may not listen<lb/> to foul speaking&#44; who shuts his eyes that they may<lb/> not behold evil doings.<lb/></p>

            <p>But not to weary you with many quotations in order<lb/> to substantiate my assertion&#44; let me point to the triple<lb/> key which will effectually unlock the portals of paradise.<lb/>  Micah has presented to it to each of us.  It is justice&#44;<lb/> mercy&#44; humility.  Not the declaration of dogmas&#44; can<lb/> give us a free access to eternity&#44; but our having stood up<lb/> for right&#44; our having exercised kindness&#44; our having presumed<lb/> nothing&#44; but trusted implicitly in the Lord.  The prophets<lb/> of old do not set forth the monstrous theory&#44; that honesty<lb/> is useless&#44; virtue a futile exercise&#44; unless accompanied<lb/> with the professor of a doctrinal belief.  Deeds and not<lb/> creeds&#44; brotherly affection&#44; and not a mere confession&#44; are<lb/> essentials in Judaism.<lb/></p>
            <p>But I imagine I seem some of you&#44; my Brethren&#44; look<lb/> with astonishment.  They could not credit&#44; that I&#44; professing<lb/> what is styled orthodoxy&#44; would advance ideas which<lb/> to them appear heretical.  They ask&#58; &#34;Do we not possess<lb/> thirteen creeds&#44; as leading points in our religion&#44; and<lb/> a denial of which&#44; according to our Sages&#44; is a forfeiture of<lb/> heavenly bliss&#63;  Can you then teach that goodness and<lb/> rectitude are all sufficient as means of salvation&#63;&#34;<lb/>  My zealous Brethren&#33;  Be not rash in your judgment.<lb/></p>

            <p>To deny a truth&#44; and to consider it a bare abstraction&#44;<lb/> of no positive bef benefit&#44; of no practical advantage&#44;<lb/> in carrying out the rules which should govern our<lb/> conduct as responsible beings&#44; are things entirely<lb/> distinct.  I admit without any reservation&#44; that the<lb/> thirteen creeds condensed in the hymns chaunted on the<lb/> eve of the Sabbath and festivals&#44; are evolved from the<lb/> scriptures&#44; and as such they claim our ready acceptance.<lb/>  I admit further that notwithstanding the opposition<lb/> Maimonides met with for having <sic>dogmatized</sic> Judaism&#44;<lb/> and bound it&#44; so to say&#44; within narrow limits&#44; he<lb/> deserves well of all posterity&#59; because he offered a support<lb/> and a comforting hope to many incapable by themselves<lb/> of drawing from Holy Writ the verities he imparted.<lb/>  But what I contend for is&#44; that adhesion to doctrines alone&#44;<lb/> will not bring us a step nearer to heaven&#59; that&#44; if I<lb/> understand my religion rightly &#40;and may God illumine<lb/> my spirit if I am in error&#41; the maxim &#34;believe and<lb/> be saved&#34; ought to be substituted by another&#44; which reads<lb/> so &#34;act well&#44; and you will be happy&#34;; in a<lb/></p>

            <p>word&#44; that righteousness&#44; charity&#44; and not<lb/> the rehearsal of articles of faith&#44; will be the bark that<lb/> shall carry us safely to the land of spirits.<lb/></p>
            <p>These remarks&#44; my dear Brethren&#33; were lately suggested<lb/> to my mind&#44; by a perusal of a series of lectures&#44; bearing<lb/> on the question of the Messiahship from a Jewish<lb/> stand&#45;point&#44; and by that of others on the same topic&#59;<lb/> directed to &#34;the lost sc sheep&#44; the house of Israel&#44;&#34; whose<lb/> rejection of a divine messiah&#44; is a cause of deep concern<lb/> to our Nazarene neighbors.  I feel no hesitation in<lb/> acknowledging that the press pulpit is misused&#44; alike<lb/> by the Israelite&#44; and by the Gentile preacher&#44; when<lb/> specially devoted to subjects so abstruse and so profitless<lb/> in their issue.  If it be correct&#44; as doubtless it is&#44;<lb/> for ministers to make those in their own fold&#44; acquainted<lb/> with the passages of Scripture which&#44; according to the<lb/> most accredited expositors&#44; allude to the advent of a<lb/> redeemer.  If it be consistent with their vocations&#44; to<lb/> explain before their own flock&#44; the doctrines of their<lb/> respective denominations&#44; it cannot in either side&#44;<lb/> promote the end of real religion&#44; frequently to discuss<lb/> subjects&#44; the drift of which may be to awake ill&#45;feelings<lb/></p>

            <p>between man and man.  I mean&#44; to render the pulpit<lb/> the arena of religious contests.  Fortunately&#44; we<lb/> Israelites can scarce be charged with being aggressors.<lb/>  We generally stand on self&#45;defense.  But verily&#44; me&#45;<lb/>thinks I perceive the cause of much of the prejudice<lb/> rankling in the breasts of individuals attached to various<lb/> creeds&#44; much of the w ill&#45;will existing to the mistaken<lb/> zeal of the ministers.  Were the latter thoroughly to<lb/> understand their mission&#44; they would speak less of theo&#45;<lb/>&#45;logy and more of universal charity.  They would instruct<lb/> their hearers in the duties of life&#44; they would strive to extirpate<lb/> vice&#44; to check intemperance&#44; to lower the standard of<lb/> corruption raised in high places&#44; and&#44; while enforcing the<lb/> observances of their church&#44; they would nevertheless never<lb/> lose sight of the direction drawn from the words of Malachi<lb/> speaking of the duties of the priests&#44; he says &#34;The law of truth<lb/> is in his mouth&#44; iniquity is not found upon his lips&#44; he<lb/> walks with God peacefully and uprightly&#44; and many<lb/> he does recall from sin.&#34;  Such is the charge<lb/> of the good shepherd&#44; happy they to whom he administers.<lb/></p>

            <p>And you&#44; my dear Brethren&#44; let my lesson be deepened<lb/> in your hearts.  Learn all the dogmas&#44; all the precepts&#44;<lb/> all the traditions of your faith&#59; that you may be able<lb/> to defend them when attacked.  But avoid angry discussions.<lb/>  Tell every man fearlessly the belief to which you<lb/> adhere&#44; a belief&#44; the principles of which you may<lb/> not be ashamed to acknowledge&#44; if you but under&#45;<lb/>stand their sublimity.  But tell likewise all human<lb/> beings&#44; that because you believe in Judaism&#59; you do<lb/> believe that all can be saved&#44; who &#34;exercise justice&#44;<lb/> love mercy&#44; and walk humbly with God.&#34;<lb/></p>
