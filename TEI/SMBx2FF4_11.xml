            <p>Revd S. Morais<lb/></p>
            <p> My valued Friend&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>It is not often that I allow<lb/> you interesting favours to remain so long un-<lb/>answered, but it seems that I have had such<lb/> an amount of correspondence to combat<lb/> with that I at times get tired writing.<lb/></p>
            <p> As usual I read your last with much<lb/> pleasure&#44; for I know full well your head and<lb/> heart is with our cause&#44; and I cannot ex-<lb/>pect you to use any influence with your<lb/> congregation other than to speak a good<lb/> word when needed.  Whilst I was in Phila<lb/> I could see pretty well how congregational<lb/> affairs drifted where the expenditure of money<lb/> would be involved&#44; hence I see precisely the<lb/> attitude you are placed in regard to making<lb/> any suggestion that may tend embarrassing<lb/> to the finances of your congregation&#44; my<lb/> main aim is to try and have the Eastern<lb/> Preparatory Schools or Trades for the College<lb/> proper&#44; located at Philadelphia&#44; instead of<lb/> New York&#44; as Phila for its quietude is better adapted&#44;<lb/>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
                and I know you would be in your element<lb/> to accomplish that towards our union and college<lb/> that you have always preferred&#59; and again&#44;<lb/> whilst you do not seek any pecuniary advantage<lb/> for your labour in the love of teaching.  I would<lb/> desire to make it advantageous to you (notwithstan<lb/>ding your present ideas&#44; however&#44; all this will<lb/> be a topic for further consideration, but as<lb/> a matter of course&#44; if you were to tender<lb/> your services particularly for the first year or<lb/> longer&#44; as Dr Wise has done&#44; it might prove as<lb/> a Stimulus to locate the <sic>Auxillary</sic> at Phila&#44;<lb/> rather than to pay a large salary to any one<lb/> in New York.  Now in regard to the fruit<lb/> we may reap from our labours&#44; it is indeed<lb/> a hard matter to say&#44; we are doing our best<lb/> here&#44; for the advancement of Judaism&#44; our<lb/> pupils are taught according to the standard<lb/> of all Jewish institutions&#44; neither Dr Wise or<lb/> Dr Lilienthal do not advance their ideas<lb/> in contravention to the established opinions<lb/> as laid down in our standard works&#44; we<lb/> are honest and can do no more&#44; I can say<lb/> truly from what I have seen and heard at<lb/> the classes&#58; that the minds of the students are<lb/> not biased or hampered in any way&#44; they<lb/> are taught the mishnah as it is&#44; and when<lb/> they arrive at a mature age&#44; they can<lb/> form their own opinions&#44; and make their<lb/> own deductions&#44; can we do any more&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>We must all candidly admit that the minds<lb/> of this generation have undergone a great<lb/>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
                <sic>a great</sic> change&#44; they were understated<lb/> that the mere farces and ceremonies and<lb/> the antiquated tunes and Synagogue formula&#44;<lb/> does not constitute religion&#44; do we not know<lb/> men who violate the sanctity of the Sabbath &amp;<lb/> festivals&#44; and would not eat a chicken if<lb/> it was not killed in accordance with our<lb/> custom&#44; I could cite hundreds of these petty<lb/> things that is so strenuously adhered to&#44; as one<lb/> of the most important points of religion.<lb/></p>
            <p>In regard to the Eastern journal&#39;s advocacy<lb/> of the Heb. Union College now established<lb/> here&#44; and the Union of Congregations&#44; they<lb/> are all right on these questions&#44; as you<lb/> can notice&#44; they all publish our weekly<lb/> reports of the union.  Your views in regard<lb/> to a professor for the higher grades are cor-<lb/>rect&#44; we must abide our time.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dr Wise is all right&#44; you will find him as<lb/> conservative as needs be.  I have been with<lb/> day after day&#44; he is as orthodox as the<lb/> times we live in will well permit.<lb/></p>
            <p> The Dr tells me that it is rather doubtful<lb/> that he will be at our next convention in<lb/> Phila either as a delegate or visitor&#44; he<lb/> does not work to prevent a free expression of sen-<lb/>timent at the convention if the Board<lb/> of Delegates is merged into the Union and<lb/> the &#91;&#63;&#93; Eastern Congregations join the<lb/> union&#44; which will be the sequel&#44; he<lb/> told me the other day&#44; that if there be<lb/> a union of the north-south east &amp; west&#44;<lb/>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
                his desire will <del>then</del> be accomplished and<lb/> he will be willing to be <sic>superceded</sic>&#44; in<lb/> this he is honest.  I can assure you&#44;<lb/> but it is my opinion&#44; that if there be<lb/> a union complete&#44; that Dr Wise will<lb/> be the only one that will be selected<lb/> for the head.  Notwithstanding the great<lb/> opposition that has been made to him&#44;<lb/> Oh! I am tired writing and must<lb/> now close&#44; hoping this may meet all<lb/> in health&#44; with love from all to dear<lb/> Nina and best wishes to your dear self<lb/></p>
            <p>I remain, as ever<lb/>
