            <p>For &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>The real difference between Judaism and Gentilism is explained<lb/> in two Hebrew words of our Scriptural section &#91;Hebrew&#93; Religion<lb/> to deserve that name&#44; must make existence enjoyable.<lb/>  This truth was not understood by the polished heathens<lb/> of ancient Greece and Rome.  It is not understood by a the still<lb/> more civilized Nazarenes of modern times&#44; but it has always<lb/> been understood by the Pharisees of all ages.  On one occasion<lb/> four Rabbis were walking together.  Two disciples who followed<lb/> them put this question.  &#34;Ought the Sabbath to be held in abeyance<lb/> to save life&#34;&#63;  Our martyred Sage Akibah&#44; with his usual discern&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment answered.  &#34;If to avenge death the service of God was sus&#45;<lb/>&#45;pended&#44; and the sanctuary defiled by dragging the murderer&#44;<lb/> were he even a high priest&#44; from the altar of which he laid hold&#44;<lb/> should we scruple to set aside a precept of the Law to restore<lb/> life&#63;&#34;  Yes&#58; life is the highest gift&#44; and to preserve it Mo&#45;<lb/>&#45;saism gives its prescriptions.  The heathens of old also considered<lb/> life the greatest possession&#44; but like a child who has inherited<lb/> a rich patrimony&#44; and thinks himself at liberty to squander<lb/> it away&#44; so did they abuse nature&#39;s boon in the unrestrained<lb/> indulgence of appetites&#44; in carnal pleasures&#44; in acts of violence&#44; which<lb/> they dignified  by the name of votive offerings.  The gentiles of<lb/> later times also deemed life a divine grant&#44; but only a whip to<lb/> lash us into paradise.  The more the sufferings&#44; the surer<lb/> the future happiness.  The body must be chastened&#44; that the<lb/> soul may gain delights.  Fasting is a step ladder to heaven&#44;<lb/> the &#91;&#63;&#93; of society a key to the secret chamber of<lb/> angels.  The exclusion of marriage promised the embrace<lb/> of the immaculate virgin.  Thus on one side excesses which<lb/> dragged the body below the level of beasts&#44; on the other&#44; privations<lb/> caused by a misapprehension of the way of God<lb/>  The Mosaic law which was intended for men and not for angels<lb/> kept at an equal distance from the two extremes.  It took<lb/> into consideration human nature and the wants of life&#44; which it<lb/> suitably arranged and moderated&#44; but did not crush.  The<lb/> author of the Law&#44; who is also the Author of our being&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>He who has infused into us instructs and passions&#44; He<lb/> who created all that surrounds us&#44; and made the world<lb/> so beautiful&#44; so rich and of good&#44; who exalted legitimate<lb/> cravings&#44; must have aimed to elevate man above<lb/> nature&#44; but not to contradict nature.  It is against nature<lb/> not alone to abuse worldly goods&#44; but also not to use<lb/> them&#44; despising them in spite of the Giver.  It The law has not<lb/> commanded celibacy &#40;speak about the Essenes&#41; fostering<lb/> abstinence&#44; flagellation&#44; but &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; sobriety<lb/> temperance&#44; because on those virtues&#44; possible of practice<lb/> depend the spiritual not less than the temporal life of man.<lb/>  This is the sanctification &#40;comment on &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41; so<lb/> repeatedly recommended&#44; which removes from corporeal<lb/> enjoyments what is brutal or dangerous&#44; turning them<lb/> to the preservation and the contentment of the individual&#44;<lb/> and in that manner moderating them&#44; so as to render<lb/> them not alone innocent&#44; but useful to the moral<lb/> development.  Rightly has our text&#44; inculcating some<lb/> precepts&#44; added that he who practices them will live.<lb/>  He lives because they do not cast cut off but on the con&#45;<lb/>trary promote freedom and liberty of thought.  He<lb/> lives because they do not forbid enjoyment.  He lives because<lb/> he is not surrounded by the terrors of superstition.  He<lb/> lives because he is not obliged to abdicate reason&#59; because<lb/> he does not see the government of the spirit usurped<lb/> and that of his intelligence stoke stolen.  Let us then<lb/> remain faithful to a law which has preserved our exist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance as &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; and of which the Moralist says<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; expressing more literally than figu&#45;<lb/>&#45;ratively the surprising effects thereof.<lb/></p>
