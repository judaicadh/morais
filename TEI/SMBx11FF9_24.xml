            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren&#33;  Gladly would I this day have transferred to others the<lb/> privilege I enjoy by virtue of my calling.  Words of praise&#44; even on<lb/> the dead&#44; may savor of adulation&#44; when uttered by a relative and familiar<lb/> friend.  But your presence relieves my misgivings&#59; nay&#44; it is the<lb/> most expressive eulogy on the character of him&#44; whose lifeless form&#44;<lb/> Alas&#33; now lies shrouded in this coffin.  For not the idle of curiosity of<lb/> gazing upon the mortal remains of one great or powerful&#44; has convened<lb/> you together&#59; but the desire to offer a last tribute of respect to unobtru&#45;<lb/>&#45;sive virtue.  Our lamented friend had not elicited your admiration through<lb/> the qualities of the mind&#44; but he secured your esteem by the noble<lb/> attributes of his heart.  In all the walks of life&#44; his demeanour<lb/> deserved your commendation.  In the busy marts of trade&#44; David<lb/> Pesoa carried along the square &#38; compass of rectitude.  The enticements<lb/> which surround the path of the merchant are numberless&#44; but<lb/> I have not heard that a deviation form the rules of equity was ever<lb/> brought to his charge.  He preferred to earning a competence by industry&#44;<lb/> than to <sic>ammassing</sic> wealth by chicanery.  As a citizen&#44; he was<lb/> unaustentatiously patriotic.  He chose that course that he deemed<lb/> most conducive to the moral advancement of his countrymen&#44; but<lb/> guided by a spirit of forbearance and tolerance&#44; he scrupulously avoided<lb/> expressing controversial opinions.  In his social relations&#44; hospitality<lb/> and beneficence highly distinguished him.  His domestic board<lb/> was never too narrow&#44; that both friends &#38; strangers might<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>not sit then at ease.  Bountiful was his hand&#44; cordial<lb/> and warm his greeting&#59; courteous his address.  But who more<lb/> ready than he to smooth the pillow of the sufferer&#44; to watch<lb/> at his bed&#45;side&#59; administer to his comforts&#44; and seek for him<lb/> an honorable interment&#63;  Who did more strongly than he evince<lb/> active sympathy towards the forlorn and bereaved&#63;  Him&#44; my<lb/> Brethren&#33; you entrusted with the dispensing of public charity&#44; and<lb/> were not deluded in your expectations.  Him you raised to a respon&#45;<lb/>&#45;sible station&#44; and he did not forfeit your confidence.  Unaffec&#45;<lb/>&#45;tedly he labored for noble purposes&#44; and you did him honor.<lb/></p>
            <p>But you have only seen the outline of his goodly character.  Its<lb/> full lineaments are mirrored in the streaming tears of a wife bent<lb/> to the earth with unspeakable grief&#44; of a daughter overwhelmed<lb/> with sorrow&#44; of a sister lovely and disconsolate.  Every sigh they<lb/> draw&#44; is a reflection of that boundless long unwearied devotion and<lb/> tender care bestowed on them by him whose decease we bemoan&#59; for<lb/> around his fireside his virtues most brilliantly shone&#44; and never<lb/> was he happier&#44; than when he made those happy who depended on<lb/> his support.  Brethren&#33; a terrible void has<lb/> been created amid a family circle&#59; society has lost a useful member&#44;<lb/> but Judaism also became been has by the death of David Pesoa been bereft of a<lb/> faithful1 exponent.  True&#44; he had not always carried aloft the standard of<lb/> revealed religion.  He may&#44; like True his life had not always accorded with others&#44; have been lured to forego its hold&#44; while gathering<lb/> He had been allured to lower it&#44; while gathering the perishing goods<lb/> perishable goods&#44; but he glowingly overcame the sin.<lb/> the dictates of his ancestral religion.  He had been attired to post<lb/> of the with<lb/> pone to the revealed word of God&#44; the gathering of pelf but<lb/> He saw its evil way and speedily receded therefrom.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Timely and efficacious was his reform repentance&#44; because it did not follow<lb/> the decay of of his health&#44; and the waning of his strength&#44; but<lb/> it was effected during a vigorous stage of manhood&#44; when worldly<lb/> passions hold them sway.  This thought afforded him ineffable<lb/> satisfaction&#59; and upon the day prior to his dissolution he<lb/> confessed to me that the consciousness of his sincere repentance sincerity<lb/> combined with his firm reliance on the mercy of God&#44; robbed death<lb/> of its terrors&#44; and reconciled him to his fate.<lb/></p>
            <p>Kindly spirit of my departed friend&#33;  With fortitude thou hast<lb/> endured the trials sent to purify thee.  Serenely hast thou borne a sepa&#45;<lb/>&#45;ration from thy dearest objects&#59; rejoice therefore over thy victory.<lb/>  Thou hast conquered death.  Thou livest yes&#44; thou livest on earth in the<lb/> memory of those who respect cherish virtue and piety godliness&#44; thou livest in heaven<lb/> to delight in spir holy communion with the blessed&#59; thou livest<lb/> to contemplate the Essence of greatness goodness&#44; of wisdom and glory.<lb/></p>
            <p>From the &#91;&#63;&#93; whither thou hast been uplifted&#44; look down up<lb/> those who bewail thy absence&#44; and pray at the footstool of the Almighty that<lb/> a foretaste of the bliss thou enjoyest&#44; may comfort them during<lb/> their terrestrial pilgrimage&#44; until they also shall join the chorus<lb/> of Cherubim and Seraphim in the land abode of eternity.  Amen.<lb/></p>
