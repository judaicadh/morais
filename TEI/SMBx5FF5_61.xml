            <p>Hotel Byzance<lb/>
                Constantinople Feb. 3 1891<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear Dr. Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>There is now in this city<lb/> a Jewish merchant of Calcutta named<lb/> Moses Meyohas.  Mr. Meyohas is a native of<lb/> Jerusalem and devotes a considerable part<lb/> of his time in attempting to relieve the<lb/> need of the poor of his native city.<lb/>  He is now laboring on behalf of the<lb/> Sephardic community.  They are&#44; he tells<lb/> me&#44; in a most miserable condition&#44;<lb/> and unless immediate steps are taken<lb/> for their relief serious calamities are<lb/> apprehended.  There are about 12&#44;000 Sephar&#45;<lb/>dic Jews in Jerusalem and of these<lb/> 7&#44;000 are in actual distress.  As you<lb/> well know the community has always<lb/> been poor&#44; still it managed to exist<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>on the charities that were sent from<lb/> abroad.  With the influx of Russian Jews<lb/> the misery of course was increased.  Many<lb/> measures of relief have been taken in<lb/> behalf of the Russians&#45;&#45;agricultural colonies<lb/> have been started etc.&#45;&#45;but these are<lb/> intended for Russians only.<lb/></p>
            <p>As long as Sir Moses Montefiore was<lb/> alive the Sephardic community annually<lb/> appealed to him and invariably received<lb/> help.  But since his death the Sephar&#45;<lb/>dim has been in great distress and<lb/> their appeals to their brethren abroad<lb/> are not answered.  The poor formerly<lb/> got 1 1<lb/>2 piasters per month for each<lb/> member of the family&#59; at present there<lb/> is no fund at all.  Some years back<lb/> a committee was formed among the<lb/> Sephardim to distribute rice&#44; vegetables &#38;<lb/> bread for the Sabbath&#44; but this has<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>been obliged to suspend.  For this purpose about &#36;100 per month<lb/> were required.  The Sephardim being subjects of the country are<lb/> obliged to pay a military tax and the contributions they receive<lb/> from Amsterdam and London do not suffice for this purpose.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Ashkenazim&#44; on the other hand&#44; are in a much better condition.<lb/>  They have secured the control of the charitable funds and every one<lb/> receives a certain share per month.  An arrangement had been<lb/> made that money coming from America <del>who</del> should be<lb/> divided among the two communities.  Last year 282&#44;000<lb/> piasters &#40;&#36;564&#41; came from America but none of it was handed<lb/> over the Sephardim.  So great was the distress that the<lb/> Jews of the Sephardic community have sent a petition to the Sultan<lb/> praying for a concession of some land and water rights<lb/> in order that they may become farmers.  Mr. Meyohas has<lb/> undertaken to present this petition and has already had<lb/> 2 interviews with the Grand Vizier <del>with</del> on the subject.  But even<lb/> this would not afford any immediate relief.  From here Mr<lb/> Meyohas will go to London armed with letters to the<lb/> Prince of Wales through whom he desires to become acquainted<lb/> with Baron Hirsch&#44; his object being to show that <del>the</del><lb/> if the settling of Russians in Palestine is encouraged it<lb/> will be necessary to provide for the Sephardim&#44; otherwise<lb/> they will get poorer and poorer&#44; their condition will be<lb/> brought to the attention of the Turkish authorities&#44; and the<lb/> further immigration of Jews will be prohibited.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I visited the Chacham Bashi of Constantinople<lb/> and he told me that he believed the<lb/> condition of affairs was such as Mr. Meyo&#45;<lb/>has had stated&#58; Meyohas himself is<lb/> a very capable&#44; well educated man&#44;<lb/> speaking English&#44; French&#44; Italian&#44; Spanish&#44;<lb/> Turkish&#44; Arabic &#38; Hebrew.  he devotes a<lb/> portion of his every year to the Jews<lb/> of Jerusalem.  He can get no help here<lb/> the few well&#45;to&#45;do people hereabouts have<lb/> much more than their share of<lb/> poverty to relieve.  Everywhere in Constan&#45;<lb/>tinople one sees poverty and distress &#38;<lb/> about 80&#37; of the Jews here are poor.<lb/></p>
            <p>When I go to Jerusalem I shall at&#45;<lb/>tempt to look into these matters for<lb/> myself.  But as the case was represented<lb/> as very urgent I have at the<lb/> request of Mr. Meyohas written to you<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="5"/>
            <p>in the hope that a little money<lb/> might be gotten together and sent out<lb/> before Pesach.  It should be entrusted to<lb/> Jacob Valero &#38; Co. Jerusalem and the<lb/> purpose &#38; the people that it is intended<lb/> to benefit should be named.  The other<lb/> point that Mr. Meyohas desired me<lb/> to write about was a division between<lb/> the Sephardim &#38; the Asheknazim of<lb/> money coming from America.  He<lb/> thought that this could be effected<lb/> by appealing to Rabbi Jacob Joseph.<lb/></p>
            <p>I presume I have more than<lb/> used up your time &#38; patience by this<lb/> long letter.  Make such use of it or of<lb/> parts of it as you see fit.  I hope that<lb/> some good may come of it.<lb/></p>
            <p>Please give my kind regards to your<lb/> family and believe me Faithfully Yours<lb/> Cyrus Adler<lb/></p>
