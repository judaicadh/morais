            <p>To inquire when Israelites first settled in Spain&#44;<lb/> would be to ask that the dead should rise to give<lb/> us oral instruction&#44; for what the pen has written on<lb/> that topic&#44; fails to impart any positive knowledge.<lb/>  Authors who identify Tarshish of the Bible with<lb/> Tartessus&#45;&#45;an ancient city in the Iberian peninsula&#45;&#45;<lb/> believe that the <sic>Phenicians</sic>&#45;&#45;the earliest navigators known<lb/> in history&#45;&#45;having established colonies in Spain&#44; for instance&#44;<lb/> in Cadiz&#44; in Seville in Toledo&#45;&#45;cities whose names show recalling a derivation<lb/> common to the <sic>Phenician</sic> and Hebrew language&#45;&#45;carried conveyed in ships many<lb/> of King Solomon&#39;s subjects to those distant colonies.  Our clever<lb/> predecessors&#44; having learned from their seafaring neighbors<lb/> the art of commerce&#44; exchanged <sic>Palestenian</sic> goods for<lb/> precious metlas&#44; with the aborigines in the peninsula for precious metals&#44; and<lb/> thus enriched their distant own fatherland.  Some scholars<lb/> have also theorized on a passage of  the Mishnah&#44; where<lb/> the word Aspania occurs&#44; and have ventured to advance the<lb/> untenable idea that&#44; during the second Temple&#44; long<lb/> before the vulgar era&#44; men of the Jewish faith brought<lb/> offerings from Hispania&#44; which they confound with Hispania Aspania to the officiating priest<lb/> at the altar and he accepted them as if having come from consecrated<lb/> ground.<lb/></p>

            <p>More reliable however&#44; are the proofs which we possess&#44;<lb/> that the Talmudists&#44; living in Persia during the fourth<lb/> century&#44; had a knowledge of Jewish communities exist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing in the south&#45;western country of Europe.  How<lb/> were they those Jews religiously governed at the time&#63;  What<lb/> was the status extent of their secular culture&#63;  The solution of<lb/> these questions which ought&#44; by right&#44; to serve as<lb/> an introduction to my lecture&#44; I am unable to give.<lb/>  Nor do I regret it much&#44; for&#44; I surmise that in<lb/> obedience to truth&#44; I would be compelled to shame the<lb/> religion&#44; which claims the fatherhood of civilization.<lb/>  The laws of the reigning Visgoths&#44; breathe a spirit<lb/> of inveterate hatred&#44; so contradictory of to the staple Church preach&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing &#34;peace on earth and good will toward men&#44;&#34; that to read them<lb/> is to force Christianity before the bar of public opinion&#44;<lb/> and stigmatize it as the arch enemy of human progress.<lb/>  What freedom could Jews in Spain have enjoyed at that period in the<lb/> exercise of their religious practices&#44; when no worship was<lb/> tolerated&#44; and only allowed other than the most un<sic>yeilding</sic> Roman catholic&#45;<lb/>&#45;ism&#63; was allowed&#63;  What opportunities could they be<lb/> afforded to acquire a fund of useful information&#44; when no&#45;<lb/>&#45;thing else than absurd stories and legends of monks&#44; formed<lb/> the current literature&#63;<lb/></p>

            <p>The eighth century&#44; from since the birth of the Nazarene<lb/> creed&#44; had just begun dawned.

To remove the crust of ignorance<lb/> thickening around it&#44; the <sic>cimitar</sic> of the Arabs proved<lb/> a useful instrument.  The disciples of the pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;phet of Mecca&#44; spreading as far as Sicily in lower<lb/> Italy&#44; conquered also with ease soon mastered the arts and sciences<lb/> which had once flourished in the countries now subjugated by them.<lb/>  Spanish Jews&#44; loving personal liberty&#44; and the<lb/> unrestrained pursuits of the intellect&#44; hailed the<lb/> Crescent as the ensign of deliverance.<lb/></p>

            <p>The first two centuries of Asiatic rule in Southern<lb/> Europe&#44; prepared the vast field destined to produce<lb/> a harvest of knowledge&#44; which the whole world of letters was finally to<lb/> enjoy.
