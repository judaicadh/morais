            <p>Sept. 3 1877.<lb/></p>
                <p>J. C. Lyons&#44;											
            My dear Sir&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Literary labors in which I am constantly engaged&#44; and the<lb/> approaching holidays&#44; claiming my attention very seriously&#44; must serve as<lb/> apology for the brevity with which I answer your communication.  Indeed to<lb/> give it a suitable reply would be to invite a volume.  Let me then simply<lb/> say that&#58; we the believers in One all merciful God&#44; cannot admit under any<lb/> circumstances whatever the existence of a divine coadjutor.  Too often have<lb/> we been taught to deem the power of virtue our interceptor&#44; a sincere<lb/> repentance our mediator&#44; that we should give credence to a doctrine consign&#45;<lb/>ing mankind to perdition for a sin not its own&#44; and then accomplishing<lb/> redemption by the death of an innocent being&#44; <sic>temprarily</sic> a man but eternally<lb/> a god.  The dogma is subversive of the principle underlying Judaism&#44; which<lb/> is the religion of Reason&#44; and not of blind faith.  No doubt&#44; to the masses<lb/> the leading feature of Christianity affords comfort&#44; and far be it from any<lb/> to rob <sic>to rob</sic> his fellow creatures of that which gives them solace.  We<lb/> Israelites respect the convictions of others&#44; and rather than win them over<lb/> to our mode of thinking&#44; discourage proselytism.  For our golden maxim is<lb/> that every person who does his est agreeably to the light received&#44; will be<lb/> accepted by our universal Father.  As to the divinity of Jesus&#44; the error<lb/> springs from the idea that the redeemer whom Israel expects was to be a<lb/> heavenly being&#44; whereas according to our Scriptures nothing but one who<lb/> will be born and in due time die&#44; like all mortals&#44; is the promised Messiah.<lb/>  His abilities to reconstruct our nationality&#44; and eventually bring about a<lb/> reign of peace will&#44; of course&#44; be extraordinarily high&#44; and just because some<lb/> of the contemporaries of Jesus&#44; <sic>wieghed</sic> down by oppression&#44; fancied that he<lb/> might break the Roman yoke&#44; they rallied around him and would willingly<lb/> perhaps have proclaimed him king.  History however&#44; tells us that in these<lb/> troublous&#91;sic&#63;&#93; times&#44; pretended Messiahs rose and fell more than once.  It was the<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>will of the Supreme Being&#44; that the son of the carpenter should be allowed<lb/> a. <sic>afme</sic> and perpetuity rarely granted in the annals of the world and we<lb/> must bow to His decree.  But not one of the passages in the Old Testament<lb/> &#40;and this I say with great positiveness&#41; can be critically applied to this<lb/> character and reported miraculous deeds.  All Hebraists are of one mind on<lb/> that point.  Regarding the scorn and persecution of the men of Nazareth<lb/> of which your correspondent speaks&#44; I think that Israel has endured them <sic>wi</sic><lb/> with greater meekness than the ancient Galilean&#44; and to those who have<lb/> been the martyrs of a grand idea for nearly twenty centuries&#44; the palm<lb/> must be given for having served God and deserved well of the human race&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours Truly&#44;<lb/></p>
