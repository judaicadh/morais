            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>

            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>The sad event&#44; which I now sincerely lament&#44; had<lb/> been anticipated for quite a lengthy period of time&#44; but the<lb/> grief is not less keen by reason of that unfortunate<lb/> circumstance.  About <sic>Eleven</sic> months ago&#44; my<lb/> deceased brother in faith&#44; who had ever felt interested in<lb/> the welfare of the Jewish Theological Seminary&#44; which<lb/> I planted in New York&#44; accompanied me to that city<lb/> to attend a biennial convention.  I noticed then what a terrible<lb/> strain it was for him to mount up high stairs&#44; and I<lb/> pitied him with all my heart.  Since then&#44;<lb/> I occasionally saw him&#44; and buoyed myself up with<lb/> the hope that his health had not&#44; at all events&#44; grown<lb/> worse.  A cause of pain to my own self<lb/> was&#44; when on the 19th of last September&#44; severe illness<lb/> enforced my absence from the Synagogue at a time&#44;<lb/> in which my friend was radiant with religious joy.<lb/>  His son had become Bar Mitzvah&#44; and I had promised<lb/> myself to address the youth upon that suggestive<lb/> occasion.  I did delegate my son to read<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>some words of counsel and congratulation which I had in&#45;<lb/>&#45;tended to deliver&#44; but personally I was denied that satisfac&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion of witnessing the pleasurable occurrence.  It was last<lb/> Sabbath that a mutual friend informed me of the des&#45;<lb/>&#45;perate condition of M A.  I called<lb/> shortly after&#44; but only to perceive that the sand of<lb/> life had fast run down.  The loving parent had prayed<lb/> to be spared until his boy reached his religious<lb/> initiation and God harkened to his supplication.<lb/></p>  
            <p>&#34;He ought to have lived longer&#34; we finite beings&#44;<lb/> whose vision reaches no further than a span&#44; exclaim.<lb/>  But who will dare say to the Judge of the Universe&#44; &#34;What<lb/> doest Thou&#63;&#34;  I shall not then offer a wicked advice&#59;<lb/> I will not tell a widow and her offspring&#44; I will not tell<lb/> whoever bemoans the loss sustained &#34;join in loud lament&#45;<lb/>&#45;ations&#44;&#34; murmur against the Lord&#44; by reason of His<lb/> decree.&#34;  No&#44; I will rather recall the qualities of<lb/> the deceased&#44; and let them be a measure of comfort.<lb/>  For&#44; I believe that a religious disposition was<lb/> his&#44; and gladly would he have <sic>comformed</sic> with all<lb/> the ordinances of our creed&#44; had not dire necessity stood<lb/> in the way of their complete performance.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>The little of which he could dispose&#44; he cheerfully gave<lb/> for the maintenance of Israel&#39;s faith and for the per&#45;<lb/>&#45;manence of institutions likely to promote that bliss&#45;<lb/>ful end.  To foster principles of goodness among<lb/> his dearest and nearest&#44; was&#44; I think&#44; his constant<lb/> aim.  To supply all their wants&#44; despite the trials of<lb/> bodily and mental sufferings which he was made to<lb/> endure&#44; was&#44; I believe&#44; his incessant effort.  Those<lb/> virtues must be a crown of glory&#44; prepared for his<lb/> soul in the regions of tranquility&#44; where sickness<lb/> never enters&#44; and spiritual health flows peren&#45;<lb/>&#45;nially.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have but one word more to address to the bereaved<lb/> wife and fatherless children.  I beg of you<lb/> Mrs M A to cultivate well and<lb/> with singleness of purpose these goodly plants&#44; en&#45;<lb/>&#45;trusted to your care.  Let them grow&#44; as the Psalm&#45;<lb/>&#45;ist expressed it &#34;in the Courts of our God&#44; House of the Lord ever flourish&#45;<lb/>&#45;in in the courts of our God&#34;  Let your mind be centred on the thought<lb/> of honoring the memory of your husband&#44; by &#91;&#63;&#93; leading<lb/> his progeny in the path of righteousness.<lb/></p>
            <p>And you dear boy and girl&#44; who are of an age which<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>enables you to understand your obligations&#44; cling<lb/> to your mother&#44; and let your undivided af&#45;<lb/>fection&#44; assuage the sorrow with which she<lb/> has now been stricken.  Endeavour to heighten<lb/> the heavenly happiness of him that has begotten<lb/> you&#44; by your remaining true to your mother&#44; true<lb/> to your creed&#44; true to your people.<lb/></p>
            <p>O Parent of mercy&#33; pour forth a stream of con&#45;<lb/>&#45;solation upon a bereaved family in Israel.  May<lb/> they bow resignedly to Thy ordination.  Command<lb/> Thy angels to usher in and exalt the soul of Thy<lb/> servant M. A. into the realm of eter&#45;<lb/>&#45;nity&#59; of unalloyed beatitude.  May in him be fulfilled<lb/> the words of Isaiah.  &#34;I will lead him on&#44; and bestow<lb/> comforts upon him&#44; and upon those who mourn for him.&#34;<lb/>  So may it be.  Amen.<lb/></p>
