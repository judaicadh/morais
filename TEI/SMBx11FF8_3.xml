            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Ask me not for words of consolation.  My heart is full of sorrow.<lb/>  Cruel death&#33;  Thou hast stealthily borne away thy victim.  While<lb/> basking in the sun&#45;shine of prosperity.  A joyous mother was she&#59;<lb/> a fondly loved wife.  comforts encompassed her around&#59; human delights<lb/> were strewn in her path.  And now&#44; O fell Destroyer&#33;  Thou didst for<lb/> ever still that heart&#44; which throbbed with affection.  Mute hast thou<lb/> rendered the lips that breathed words of endearment.  This funeral<lb/> pale overshadows all minds.  It is as gloom cast over a whole com&#45;<lb/>&#45;munity in Israel.  For&#44; from the hour that Sophia De Young became<lb/> the life copartner of Lazarus Hecht&#44; a new spirit rested upon her&#59;<lb/> a spirit of religious knowledge and piety&#59; a spirit of meekness<lb/> and fear of the Lord.  To believe and act rightly was the goal&#44; she<lb/> strove to attain.  Each revolving sabbath would she betake<lb/> herself to the house of God&#44; to pray for light and strength.<lb/>  In the Tabernacle of the Most High&#44; she poured forth thanks for<lb/> blessings enjoyed&#44; and implored the Divine protection for those who<lb/> made her happy.  How her countenance beamed with plea&#45;<lb/>&#45;sure&#44; when y her yet infant son&#44; essayed to join the faithful in<lb/> their supplications.  How earnest were her endeavours&#44; that he<lb/> should early be taken when he could learn to seek refuge beneath<lb/> the Shield of Abraham.  Alas&#33; her child so young and promising<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>has been suddenly bereft of his main stay.  A mother&#39;s fostering<lb/> hand will not nurture that tender plant&#44; her eyes will not<lb/> watch his its growth&#44; and guard it against baleful surroundings.<lb/>  And the innocent suckling&#44; but yesterday pillowed on her breast&#44;<lb/> will never lispingly call the name of mother.  Sad&#44; unutterably<lb/> sad is the scene we now behold&#44; but it can affect none so grie&#45;<lb/>&#45;vously as those two beings whom Sophia Hecht guided with<lb/> persuasive counsel and discretion.  Rachel and Miriam&#44; her dau&#45;<lb/>&#45;ghters&#44; not by nature&#44; but through that mighty power which binds<lb/> heart to heart&#59; the power of love.  Open ye to that distressed<lb/> husband a spring&#44; whence he may draw a cup of consolation.<lb/>  Your filial devotion may partly assuage the intensity of his sorrow.<lb/>  I search in vain for words that may calm his agitated spirit&#44; that<lb/> may quiet the mind which wistfully looks for an object he can<lb/> no more find upon earth.  Appalled&#44; terrified&#44; by a calamity so unfore&#45;<lb/>&#45;seen&#44; I can only but repeat to myself in the language of the prophet<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;This also cometh from<lb/> the Lord of hosts&#59; who is wonderful in counsel&#44; great in deeds of<lb/> wisdom.&#34;  Aye&#44; my sympathising hearers&#33; he that<lb/> first uttered the word &#34;chance&#44;&#34; spoke of that which has no<lb/> existence.  We poor&#44; finite creatures&#44; with a vision<lb/> so narrow&#44; with a knowledge so circumscribed&#44; cannot understand<lb/></p>

            <p>why we are tossed upon a sea of troubles.  Unable to<lb/> reconcile our sufferings with the ideas we have formed of divine<lb/> mercy&#44; we enthrone chance where God dwells&#59; and to it we assign<lb/> the origin of our woes.  But if we could fling aside the veil<lb/> which hides conceals from our eyes the ways of Providence&#44; we would see that<lb/> the Author of our lives&#44; permits at times some evils to befall<lb/> us&#44; that he may ultimately accomplish in us a design high and glorious.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93; For&#44; He doth not afflict unwittingly&#44; nor<lb/> causelessly grieve thus the children of man&#44; For our good&#44; my dear Brethren&#33; solely<lb/> for our good&#44; he tries us in the crucible of afflictions.  It may be<lb/> that he wishes to wean us away from the world and its seductive<lb/> pleasures.  It may be that he desires to exalt us in spirit&#44; for&#44;<lb/> it is in the school of sorrow that we are taught humility&#44;<lb/> goodness and charity&#59; those noble qualities that likens the<lb/> creature to his Creator.  Oh&#33; that we could so think always.<lb/>  For&#44; then we would continue serene amidst dire misfortunes&#59; we<lb/> would bless the hand which wounds&#44; in order that we may finally<lb/> be thoroughly healed and purified and eternized in the presence<lb/> of our everlasting Father.  For&#44; that that is joy&#58; to know that<lb/> we are night unto God&#44; though treading this perishable earth.<lb/>  For The whom he loveth&#44; he chasteneth &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and happy<lb/> is the man who that despiseth not that correction.  To day he may<lb/></p>

            <p>follow to the grave a dear brother&#59; to&#45;morrow one whose smile<lb/> he prized above rubies may lie dead before him. but within his<lb/> H His eyes may be fountains of tears&#44; but within him abides <sic>tran&#45;<lb/>&#45;quillity</sic>.  For&#44; the light of God is shed upon his soul.

            <p>O Parent of all good&#33;  Infuse such feelings into the heart of this<lb/> disconsolate husband.  Uplift his thoughts to Thee&#44; and let him<lb/> behold his fondly loved Sophia in a sphere bright and joyous.<lb/>  Let him hear her angel&#45;like voice commend to his guardianship<lb/> the treasures she has left behind on earth&#59; her two darling sons and daughter<lb/> Let him heed her counsel&#59; for&#44; she openeth her mouth with wisdom&#44;<lb/> and the law of kindness is in her tongue.  She asks that he may<lb/> immortalize himself by an act of sublime charity&#44; even by forgiving<lb/> the hapless being&#44; who unwittingly severed the ties which bound her<lb/> to all she still holds dear. upon earth  Oh&#33; let the believe that she looks<lb/> down approvingly upon the goodly deeds of her surviving relatives&#44; incite<lb/> them all to a life of piety&#44; and unflinching unswerving rectitude.<lb/></p>
