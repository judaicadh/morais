            <p>Not to deliver a rightly conceived and well de&#45;<lb/>&#45;served lengthy eulogy&#45;&#45;for which I am too ill pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;pared&#45;&#45;have I responded to the call of a respected<lb/> family in Israel.  I have left Philadelphia&#45;<lb/>&#45;notwithstanding the pressure of many duties&#45;&#45;upon<lb/> this day&#44; the eve of a religious festival&#44; in order<lb/> personally to show regard for the character of the<lb/> honored dead and sympathy to his mourners.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93; is the legal de&#45;<lb/>&#45;cision of our olden teachers.  And that rule&#44;<lb/> very considerately laid down for our government&#44;<lb/> is an instance and under circumstances like the<lb/> present&#44; received repeated illustrations&#44; which the Tal&#45;<lb/>&#45;mudical treatise&#44; referring to obsequies&#44; has chronicled.<lb/>  We may then with a qualm of conscience set aside the thought that the<lb/> sacred memories clustering round this historic sea&#45;<lb/>&#45;son&#44; would preclude the total performance of<lb/> funeral rites.  We may raise a voice of lament be&#45;<lb/>cause of a loss&#44; which is more than a domestic be&#45;<lb/>&#45;reavement.  For&#44; the estimable colleague of mine&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>whom death has torn away from loving surroundings&#44;<lb/> could have boasted of having continually dwelt &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> where learning might be acquired and again dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;seminated in turn far and wide.<lb/></p>
            <p>I recall now the time&#44; when I first saw my brother&#44;<lb/> whose demise is sorrowed for.  In the afternoon of a<lb/> Sabbath&#44; nearly forty eight years ago&#44; Abraham Pereira<lb/> Mendes took his stand in the venerable Sehpard&#45;<lb/>&#45;ic Synagogue in London&#44; where one with whom he<lb/> was destined to become closely allied&#44; filled the po&#45;<lb/>&#45;sition of &#34;Reader&#34;&#45;&#45;a position which among the<lb/> descendants of Menasseh Ben Israel&#44; was never looked<lb/> upon as unimportant.  A Shehach Zibbur<lb/> or leader in the Divine services&#44; as the term<lb/> implies&#44; represented among Hispano&#45;Portuguese Jews&#44;<lb/> a marked individuality&#45;&#45;an official most essential<lb/> in the house of God&#44; where the faithful unitedly<lb/> should offer their devotions under his guidance.<lb/>  But in all reality David Aaron De Sola &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; could prove himself vastly above the<lb/> average of men&#44; who performed the same functions&#44;<lb/> which he discharged with dignity.  For a person<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>of varied capacities he was&#59; a Hebraist well versed<lb/> in his people&#39;s literature&#59; a linguist <sic>weilding</sic><lb/> a facile pen in English and corresponding in fo&#45;<lb/>&#45;reign tongues with scholars abroad.<lb/></p>
            <p>Abraham Pereira Mendes&#44; the future son in law<lb/> of the versatile&#45;minded De Sola&#44; was privileged<lb/> to address the Congregation on the initial occasion<lb/> that I met him in Bevis Marks and I unacquainted then with the vernacular heard that the youthful preacher acquitted himself creditably.  Since<lb/> then&#44; privately and publicly he assiduously spread<lb/> the knowledge of sacred lore among all who came<lb/> within reach of his tuition.  In the mother country<lb/> and in the provinces&#44; as a school preceptor or as presid&#45;<lb/>&#45;ent of an ecclesiastical Board&#44; as Hazan or Darshan<lb/> he labored to one end&#59; to broaden the field of religious<lb/> culture&#44; that our young progeny might grow firmly<lb/> rooted in the ancestral Judaism&#44; over the preservation<lb/> of which the ancients vigilantly watched &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Bent upon that purpose&#44; my colleague dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;covered that history is preeminently the mentor<lb/></p>

            <p><sic>counselling</sic> a rising generation by experience&#44; and<lb/> he betook himself to the task both orally and<lb/> by writings to raise pupils&#44; familiar with the event&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful annals of Israel.  The zealous minister and<lb/> instructor modestly anticipated others&#44; who<lb/> have enlarged more upon that topic in the ver&#45;<lb/>&#45;nacular.  Eager for the observance of doctrines<lb/> and tenets&#44; which I verily believe&#44; he uniformly carried out&#44; the<lb/> catechist expounded the principles underlying<lb/> the Torah in a manual for the guidance of our<lb/> children.  And with the pen in hand&#44; which<lb/> might record the interposition of God in the check&#45;<lb/>&#45;ered life of the Hebrew nation&#44; and the glories of<lb/> God&#39;s inspired legislation&#44; Abraham Pereira<lb/> Mendes wore a clerical robe becomingly&#44; never <lb/>suffering aught to tarnish its purity.  There&#45;<lb/>fore public esteem weaves now a crown of<lb/> unfading flowers and lays it over this coffin.<lb/></p>
            <p>Indeed&#44; if the maxim of our Sages can afford<lb/> a measure of comfort&#44; if the Rabbinical dictum<lb/> that &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; whosoever keeps<lb/> sentry to prevent any encroachment upon the<lb/></p>

            <p>Sinain belief&#44; his soul is celestially cared for&#59;<lb/> if such an aphorism&#44; I say&#44; can console the<lb/> mourners&#44; my friends must be solaced by the assur&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance that the consistent Israelite and promoter of<lb/> knowledge&#44; is now well guarded in bliss.<lb/></p>
            <p>Still the Jewess who pledged her affections to Abraham<lb/> Pereira Mendes&#44; nearly half a century ago&#44; the<lb/> mother of his numerous offspring&#59; the veritable<lb/> companion of his existence&#44; cannot suppress her<lb/> grief&#44; either by reason of ritual rules&#44; or even by<lb/> the reflection that &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Surely there<lb/> is a spirit in man&#34; and that &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; the merciful Lord does not deny any<lb/> of His creatures the reward due to their virtues.<lb/>  The anguish created by the void is too deep to be<lb/> allayed forthwith by any consideration.  Inse&#45;<lb/>parably the two had led a life of incorruptibility&#59;<lb/> in separably they strove to ensure for society mem&#45;<lb/>&#45;bers deserving of regard&#44; by educating sons and<lb/> daughters uprightly&#44; so that they might become<lb/> notably useful in their various callings.  And to<lb/> a person made keenly sensitive by culture&#44; by<lb/></p>

            <p>refining surroundings and by the remembrance<lb/> of a dear conjugal past unmarred by disturbing causes&#44; the loss sustained by which Mrs<lb/> Abraham Peirera Mendes has sustained is poignantly grievous.<lb/>  I shall not attempt now that the dear dead lies<lb/> unburied before her tear obs dimmed vision&#44; to offer<lb/> words of sympathy&#44; which might sound like<lb/> hollow phrases.  I turn to the children<lb/> with an abiding confidence.  They will gradually<lb/> assuage the pain&#44; which their mother endures.<lb/>  They will bestrew her path with the sweets of<lb/> filial love and united devotion.  They will<lb/> hallow the memory of their father by clinging ever<lb/> nearer to the heart of her whom he fondly cherished.<lb/>  And from the realms where the servant of Israel&#39;s God<lb/> is imparadised&#44; he will thus bestow on each of his<lb/> sons and daughters the priestly benediction.<lb/></p>
                <p>May the Lord bless thee and keep thee in health.<lb/>  May the Lord give thee light and understand right<lb/> and graciously uphold thee therein.  May the Lord look<lb/> benignantly towards thee&#44; so that peace&#44; the summary of<lb/> terrestrial joys&#44; be thy portion.  And so may it be.<lb/></p>
