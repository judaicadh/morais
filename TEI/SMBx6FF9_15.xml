                2316 CALIFORNIA STREET.<lb/></p>
            <p>SAN FRANCSICO&#44; CAL. June 26th&#44; 1892<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. S. Morais&#44;<lb/>
                My Dear Sir&#58;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your esteemed favor of May 8th was received in due course<lb/> of mail&#44; but various circumstances among others&#44; a recurrence of my old<lb/> bilious troubles&#44; have prevented an <del>sooner</del> earlier reply.  Mr. Israel Shapero<lb/> has confirmed every word of praise you have been pleased to bestow on<lb/> him.  I found him not alone well versed in Talmudical literature but<lb/> to my astonishment&#44; I found him an adept in a class of literature to<lb/> which I have paid much attention of late years&#44; to wit&#44; the literature<lb/> of the text critics.  On this subject I would like to exchange some<lb/> views with you with reference to your rather harsh statements in your<lb/> lecture before the Seminary&#44; but I am still too depressed from the ef&#45;<lb/>fects of my indisposition to engage in any exchange of ideas.<lb/></p>
            <p>Mr. Shapero has had a rather unfortunate career in this city.  He<lb/> has been assisted time and again&#44; but the money went rapidly through the<lb/> sieve of his necessities and he finally left&#44; and is now I believe in<lb/> Tacoma.  I think some day you will see him again.  The trouble with<lb/> him is that he is absolutely incapable of doing <del>mental</del> manual labor.  He is<lb/> energetic enough but he has failed in everything he undertook and having<lb/> no &#34;Beth Hammedrash&#34; in this city where he could pass his days in his<lb/> favorite studies he began to realize that San Francisco was not the<lb/> proper place for him.  I have found some difficulty in persuading the<lb/> hard&#45;hearted San Francisco merchants that Mr. Shapero was an object of<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>sympathy and that gentleman has antagonized quite a number of them by<lb/> the manner with which he acknowledged the little he received.  Take it<lb/> all in all&#44; I have a sincere liking for Mr. Shapero but am unable to<lb/> support him in luxurious idleness such as I realize would be pleasing<lb/> to his soul&#44; for despite his energy I conceive that to him like to most<lb/> of the Polish scholars&#44; labor is odious.  I therefore thought it best<lb/> to facilitate his departure from this city.<lb/></p>
            <p>I trust all is well with you and saving the severe indisposition<lb/> mentioned&#44; I can report the same from me and mine.<lb/>  Very truly yours&#44;<lb/> Jacob Voorsanger Esq<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;Dictated&#41;<lb/></p>
