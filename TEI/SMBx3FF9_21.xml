            <p>237 S. Desplaines St.<lb/>
                Chicago&#44; Decbr 1. 1884.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Rev. S. Morais&#44;<lb/>
                Philadelphia<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Sir&#58;&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>A few minutes ago the letter carrier<lb/> delivered to me a letter which caused me delight and<lb/> shame at the same time. If I may use an &#34;Irish bull&#34;&#44;<lb/> I can say that this letter was no letter at all. It was<lb/> but an <sic>enveloppe</sic> containing a slip  from the Philad<hi rend="sup">a</hi><lb/> &#34;Daily Record&#34;&#44; and nothing else&#59; but the direction on<lb/> this <sic>enveloppe</sic> was written by you&#44; dear and most esteemed<lb/> Rabbi S. Morais&#33; If I say now that this &#34;letter&#34; gave<lb/> me delight&#44; it was because it came from you&#44; and I thought&#44; <lb/> How kind is this gentleman to think of me and to send me<lb/> a slip from a Phil<hi rend="sup">a</hi> paper wherein my name is mentioned<lb/> and how noble hearted a man must he be&#44; as by this act&#44;<lb/> seemingly so small and insignificant&#44; he proves that it is<lb/> a joy to him to cause joy to others&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>But I said above also that a sense of shame<lb/> was at the same time awakened within me by your<lb/> letter. For it was a reminder that I had neglected<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>to acknowledge receipt of your postal card which<lb/> you mailed to me 10 or 12 days ago. Please excuse&#33;<lb/> Please don&#39;t consider me rude and unrespectful&#33;<lb/> I might&#44; as mitigating circumstances&#44; mention that<lb/> the contents of your recent postal required no par&#45;<lb/>ticular answer&#59; I might further say that I was<lb/> not well&#44;&#45;&#45; and this is indeed so&#44; for I am a <lb/> chronic sufferer since many years under a<lb/> form  <sic>a</sic> sickness which often returns and which&#44;<lb/> whenever it comes&#44; makes me almost unable to<lb/> lift up my hand or to collect my thoughts.<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>I have learned from the slip you have sent to me that my few remarks on Wise&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; in the last num&#45;<lb/>ber of the &#34;Old Test. Student&#34;&#44; have been noticed by a<lb/> gentleman in your city. Some additional remarks<lb/> on the same subject the next issue of the &#34;O.T. Student&#34;<lb/> will contain. But I have also seen that the<lb/> writer in the &#34;Daily Record&#34; refers to an article of<lb/> you on the same matter. I am almost sure that<lb/> you agree with me in my remarks&#44; though I had<lb/> not the pleasure of seeing your article.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>In order not to send away this letter so<lb/> <hi rend="underline">very</hi> empty&#44; permit me to add something else.<lb/> You know that at least among the German and<lb/> Polish Jews the name  &#91;Hebrew&#93; has become the proverb&#45;<lb/>ial designation for a person who has ill luck<lb/> in everything he undertakes. I don&#39;t know whether<lb/> this name is used in the same sense among Italian<lb/> or other Sephardic Jews. Since a German poet<lb/> &#40;Chamisso&#41; wrote his novel &#34;Peter Schlemihl&#34;&#44;<lb/> the word has even become a household word among<lb/> the Germans in general. Now I was of the opinion<lb/> that as a real proper noun the name was never<lb/> borne by any one since the days of Ben Tzurishaddai&#44;<lb/> at least that it is totally unusual since biblical<lb/> times. I was therefore a little surprised when I <lb/>learned that among Italian Israelites the name<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; occurs then and now. In Lampronte&#39;s&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; in the volume containing &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; I found<lb/> on page 40<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#44; line 14 from below&#44; the name<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; in a legal document published<lb/> there. Have you been aware from personal knowledge<lb/> that in Italy still this name is in use&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>I know it is very well that in this regard Italy quite<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>differs from Germany&#59; that names are there in use<lb/> not <sic>heared</sic> at all in Germany&#44; and vice versa.<lb/> So I know that in the beginning of the 18. century<lb/> there was an &#91;Hebrew&#93; in Mantova whose name was<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#45;&#45; a name almost unthinkable<lb/> to a German or Polish Israelite&#8212;and this &#91;Hebrew&#93; was the<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;. So did &#91; Hebrew&#93; call his first<lb/> born son&#8212;who died&#44; alas&#33; too early&#8212;by the unusual<lb/> name &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Philogenos&#41;. Is it not customary<lb/> in your native country to give children the names<lb/> of dear departed relatives&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>Let me conclude now. I am perfectly<lb/> satisfied if you consider the foregoing &#34; talk&#34;<lb/> as a sign that it is a sincere pleasure to<lb/> me to have  sometimes the honor of addressing<lb/> myself to the venerable and venerated Rabbi<lb/> of the Mikve Israel Congregation in Philadelphia&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>With sincerest regards<lb/>
                yours very respectfully<lb/>
                B. Felsenthal<lb/></p>
