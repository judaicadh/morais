            <p>Cincinnati Feb. 1st&#47;76<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. S. Morais<lb/>
                Dear <sic>Instructer</sic>&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p><sic>from</sic> the apart&#45;<lb/>ment of the B. grade of the intermediate school of Cin<lb/>cinnati I send you this letter&#44; in which I will give you<lb/> a full information of my Present condition&#44; and<lb/> with which I will pay you also the man<del>n</del>y thanks what<lb/> I owe you from before and especially for the last letter<lb/> which I had received when I was at Cleveland&#44; which<lb/> ascended me with this <del>glory name</del> definition to be called &#34;this is<lb/> the pupil of Rev. S. Morais.â€ž for whom in every respect<lb/> as Mr. Ezekiel so Dr. Wise and Lilienthal like to revise<lb/> his words&#44; and therefore as I came to this city and<lb/> showed my letter to Mr Ezekiel&#44; he received me very<lb/> kindly and <sic>entroduced</sic> me to the Drs. of this city<lb/> who also were very kindly to me<lb/></p>
            <p>But the first question<lb/> was asked to me &#34;have I passed through any school<lb/> at home&#63; am I able to give an examination of these<lb/> Branches which they learn in the intermediate<lb/> school&#63;  That I can be received in the high school<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>because the <sic>Rull</sic> of this College says that no one can be<lb/> taken in into this College unless he is <sic>gratuated</sic> or a scholar<lb/> of a High school&#44; and when I answered &#34;Noâ€ž was not any<lb/> chance for me to <sic>entetain</sic> the college&#44; but that Faint&#45;<lb/>hearty man Mr. Ezekiel <sic>didnt</sic> spare his <sic>trubles</sic> and secured me<lb/> <sic>me</sic> with good hopes&#44; saying there are many gentlemen in the board<lb/> of <sic>governers</sic> who perhaps will do in his favor even against the<lb/> <sic>Rull</sic> and he went also to Dr Wise and said unto him that<lb/> he should take me in in the college before the next meeting<lb/> will be held.  Dr wise received me as a pupil of this college<lb/> and he brought my name on the list of where the rest<lb/> of the names of the scholars are written of by the next meeting I hope<lb/> to receive my cost.  I was <sic>invaited</sic> by Mr Ezekiel several<lb/> times there he <sic>maid</sic> me <sic>aquainted</sic> with all the officers<lb/> of the college&#44; who were at the same time at his House<lb/> they also promised me to do every thing for me which<lb/> it is in their possibility.  I gave examine for the principle<lb/> of this school and I entered the B. grade of this school I<lb/> hope to leave this grade in a short of time &#38; to enter to the A.<lb/>  I hope this letter will reach you in your very good condition&#44; I send my best<lb/> regards to you &#38; your children the <sic>grammer</sic> which Mr Henry has I don&#39;t<lb/> need any more.  I beg you dear instructor of the correspondence to address<lb/> me to Mr Ezekiel also I beg you to write to him several words about me<lb/> the third Bell rung I must give up writing I wish you all boundties&#91;&#63;&#93; time.  I remain<lb/> J. Rubenstein<lb/></p>
