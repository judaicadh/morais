            <p>A traveller journeyed in different directions.<lb/>  Of a sudden&#44; he halted to look.  What is that&#44; which<lb/> has arrested his attention&#63;  He has lifted up his<lb/> eyes and seen at a distance a magnificent palace&#44;<lb/> beautifully lit.  He asked his own mind.  Could<lb/> that mansion have arisen by itself&#63;  And those<lb/> shining lights which I behold&#44; could they have<lb/> been kindled without a Power&#63;  While wrapped<lb/> in deep meditation the wayfarer was aroused from his thoughts by the master of the palace.  &#34;I<lb/> am the Architect&#44;&#34; He said&#58; &#34;I am the builder of<lb/> the mansion&#44; I watch over its maintenance&#44; I<lb/> keep it in unalterable order and splendor.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Now&#44; mark&#44; my Brethren&#44; the simplicity with which<lb/> the Sages introduce to our notice the working of<lb/> that far&#45;reaching intellect which discovered in na&#45;<lb/>&#45;ture a harmony&#44; a unity&#44; that &#91;&#63;&#93; demonstrating the <sic>exist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance</sic> of One sole Prime Mover&#45;&#45;God&#59; the intellect of<lb/> Abraham I say&#44; the founder of our race&#44; and the predes&#45;<lb/>&#45;tined blessing of all races of men.  A legend<lb/> it is that which repeats&#44; in other figurative language&#44; what<lb/> inspiration told in a sentence which is short&#44; but fraught<lb/></p>

The Omnipotent moulded the Universe&#44; and set it to work.  &#91;Hebrew&#93; Philosophy&#44; either ancient or modern&#44; cannot<lb/> afford us supply a clearer&#44; a more reliable information.  There was<lb/> a time in which human speculation invented a<lb/> doctrine to account for the creation of heaven and<lb/> earth.  A 2soul&#45;withering&#44; a 1mind&#45;bewildering doctrine<lb/> it was.  Molecules&#44; or invisible particles of matter<lb/> having a spontaneous motion&#44; struck together and&#44;<lb/> after untold ages&#44; shaped every thing in nature.<lb/>  That was the famous&#45;&#45;shall I not call it the<lb/></p> <p>infamous&#63;&#45;&#45;atomical theory of the Greeks.<lb/>  Rather than admit a Divine will that called forth<lb/> nature in its completion&#44; as the Talmudists express<lb/> it &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;All the<lb/> work of creation issued in its entireness and come&#45;<lb/>&#45;liness&#44;&#34; rather than acknowledge their our insuf&#45;<lb/>&#45;ficiency&#44; the limitedness of our comprehension&#44; those speculators invented a most<lb/></p>

            <p>a miracle marvel in comparison of which all the miracles of the Bible are trifles&#59;<lb/> incredible miracle&#59; the sun and the moon&#44;<lb/> what is above and beneath and around us came<lb/> into being by the inexplicable meeting of infini&#45;<lb/>&#45;tesimal particles of matter.  I do not know<lb/> whether Israelites ever tried to pull the first chapters<lb/> of Genesis after that Epicurean system&#44; for&#44; whenever<lb/> a new school of philosophy arises and gains ground&#44;<lb/> Hebrews will put their brains to the rack&#44;<lb/> in trying to find out convince themselves and to show others that Moses<lb/> had already anticipated it.  But this I do know&#44;<lb/> that the insurmountable difficulty experienced<lb/> to reconcile the simple teaching of the Bible with<lb/> the ever varying and perplexing systems of philosophy&#59; gave origin<lb/> to infidelity&#44; even to Atheism.  It was in the<lb/> middle ages&#44; as it is in our days.  And like then<lb/> so now&#44; science claims to have reached the utter&#45;<lb/>most limits at which borders of human intelligence&#59; can to have<lb/>arrive grasped truth and to have spoken the final word on philosophical truths.<lb/>  If by some novel process the scriptures can be so<lb/> made to agree twisted as to make them tally with the alleged discoveries of science&#44;<lb/> well and good&#44; if not&#44; Holy why&#44; Holy Writ must be declared consigned to oblivion&#44; it is unfit<lb/></p>

            <p>But I have no intention to call.  The Rabbinical<lb/> legend which I met&#44; while looking for a subject on<lb/> to base my remarks thereupon&#44; reminded me of a<lb/> paper that I read in a foreign periodical&#44; and I have<lb/> referred to the cause that which elicited it.  In America&#44; a<lb/> municipal council that should ask to strike out the<lb/> name of God from school books&#44; would be frowned upon&#44;<lb/> and compelled disgracefully to retire.  I have no fear that<lb/> my young brothers and sisters in faith will receive<lb/> an atheistical training&#44; but I dread the consequences<lb/> of a blatant triviality which assumes an air of im&#45;<lb/>&#45;portance&#44; and misleads the unwary into the idea that<lb/> to be an unbeliever is to be enlightened.  The Rabbis<lb/> have written intimated that a study of astronomy will give us an<lb/> insight into the Almightiness of the Creator...&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> And an the English poet&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> said that Edward Young&#44; wrote that a person skilled in Astronomy&#44; who denies the <sic>exist<lb/>&#45;ance</sic> of a Creator&#44; is an impossibility&#44; unless that<lb/> person has turned mad&#59; and he very fittingly added&#44; that<lb/> a man to be an atheist&#44; must have so stultified<lb/> his few moral senses understanding&#44; as to believe what is incredible a tissue of absurdities.<lb/></p>
