            <p>31 New St<lb/>
                Philadelphia 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> December 1853<lb/>
                Dear Madam<lb/></p>
                <p>I have been thinking over the query which<lb/> you put to me yesterday morning and as you ap<lb/>&#61;peared little satisfied with my answer&#44; which I<lb/> could not just at that moment elucidate&#44; I<lb/> referred <del>to the writing to the writings of our Rabbis<lb/> and &#91;&#63;&#93; whether they would come to my help throw some light<lb/> on the subject</del> to our authorities<lb/> to get some light on the subject&#44; and in the work of R. Isaac Arama<lb/> I met an explanation <del>as true as it is</del> which is as <del>constant</del> ingenious as it is philosophical.<lb/>  It would take me too long to repeat verbatim what<lb/> is there stated&#59; I shall therefore give you an epitome<lb/> of the same in my own simple language.<lb/></p>
                <p>The Mishna says that by <del>uplaying</del> giving forth different com&#45;<lb/>mands for creating the world&#44; the Almighty<lb/> showed how heavy is the sin the wicked who pervert<lb/> its &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; and how great the most of the righteous<lb/> who uphold <del>the perfection</del> the dignity of that work which <del>next were</del> &#40;humanly speaking&#41;<lb/> casts the Lord so much labour <del>to the Lord</del>.  By this a truth<lb/> on which his moral existence <del>of man</del> depend&#44; has been<lb/> conveyed of <del>his word</del> the &#91;&#63;&#93;&#45;namely&#45;his freedom of action.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
                <p>It was of course &#91;&#63;&#93; to the Almighty to create the world<lb/> in an instant as in the time recorded in Holy Writ but then the result<lb/> would have been that as nothing in nature could claim<lb/> precedence&#44; the laws of &#34;cause and effect&#34; as we now see<lb/> them&#44; could not exist.  All under the sun would depend<lb/> upon constant miracles and not upon those laws fixed from<lb/> the beginning.  Now&#44; if such constant miracles were <del>compressed</del> felt by<lb/> the wicked man as well as the righteous&#44; the former<lb/> might be hardened in his iniquity&#44; if they excluded him<lb/> then he would by force become good&#44; for what he expects<lb/> to receive&#44; and freedom of action would be nullified.<lb/></p>
                <p>But as it is now <del>is</del> nature by its gradual development<lb/> through &#34;cause and effect&#34; as it is perceptible in the bible&#44;<lb/> follows the laws imposed by the Creator&#44; and though it<lb/> spreads its influence indiscriminately&#44; it does not<lb/> work incessant miracles&#44; which would either mislead<lb/> the wicked&#44; who might &#91;&#63;&#93; they were received in<lb/> his favour&#44; or compel every one to be righteous<lb/> on account of the benefits it would accrue&#44;<lb/> rendering thereby the freedom of action negatory.<lb/>  Nevertheless He who has established those laws<lb/> can invert them to punish or reward and conse<lb/>quently the wicked who do not <del>mount upwards</del> devote themselves<lb/> from that long chain of &#34;cause and effect&#34; to the<lb/> original cause&#44; and who do not perceive from<lb/> the order of creation&#44; that their temporary prosperity<lb/> is not the effect of their iniquity but of certain<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
                <p>laws&#44; what might be used against them by<lb/> their eternal Author&#44; are in the words of the<lb/> Mishna liable to great punishment the like manner on<lb/> the other hand the righteous who by studying the<lb/> order of nature&#44; ascend with their mind to its<lb/> supreme maker&#44; and who&#44; through this might<lb/> argue that the committal of sin could not<lb/> altogether withdraw from them the benefits<lb/> <del>of the laws of nature</del> which nature bestows&#44; still for the love they<lb/> bear to God abstain from crime&#44; are deserving<lb/> of a large recompense.<lb/></p>
                <p>I give it to you as I have found it&#44; but it<lb/> must be confessed that the question is rather<lb/> too abstruse to be easily solved.<lb/></p>
                <p>Yours respectfully<lb/>
                S Morais<lb/></p>
