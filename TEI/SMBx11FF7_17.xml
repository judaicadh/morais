            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Brethren.  If even the Rabbinical code by which I<lb/> am guided&#44; did not restrain me from bewailing a<lb/> loss and from eulogising the dead over his coffin&#44;<lb/> at this festive season in Israel&#44; I still would<lb/> withhold my lamentations and my panegyric<lb/> in the present instance.  I would not lament&#44;<lb/> because having witnessed paraxysims of suffering anguish&#44;<lb/> I deem this transition into a state of blissful <sic>tranquillity</sic>&#44;<lb/> a Divine deliverance from unspeakable anguish suffering&#44;<lb/> both physical and mental.  I would not pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;nounce an encomium&#44; because I consider my&#45;<lb/>&#45;self disqualified.  A Talmudical maxim wise<lb/> and just&#44; is that which bids us not to pronounce pass<lb/> a public judgment touching on the character of<lb/> persons to whom who we are beholden for any<lb/> favor.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> And this aphorism is supported by many numerous illustra&#45;<lb/>&#45;tions.  I shall cite one simply to show why<lb/> I am reticent&#44; why I am scrupulous on this point.  It is related<lb/> of Samuel&#44; the President of an academy of sacred learning in<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Naharden&#44; that on a certain occasion&#44; while<lb/> crossing a bridge&#44; a man laid hold of his arm<lb/> to help him along.  Samuel refused declined subsequent&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly to act as <sic>counsellor</sic>&#44; in his legal capacity&#44; for<lb/> that same man&#44; fearing that lest the kindness received<lb/> might have predisposed his mind in behalf<lb/> of the litigant.  Now&#58; if such was the delicacy<lb/> of feelings governing the conduct of our olden<lb/> teachers who did not wish feared to be biased and to appear partial&#44; how much greater ought my feelings of delicacy to be&#44;<lb/> who have experienced the kindness of my depart&#45;<lb/>&#45;ed friend not once but frequently&#63;  Fain would<lb/> I extol his generous instincts in various relations of life&#44; as gladly readily as<lb/> I should&#44; at other times&#44; have praised his at&#45;<lb/>&#45;tachment devotion to the practices of the ancestral faith.<lb/>  But I forbear&#44; glad to believe that the deceased<lb/> did not bestow his attention on an ingrate.<lb/>  But there is a point not strictly funereal and therefore not infringing on the rules&#44;<lb/> on which I wish desire to make a passing remark&#44;<lb/> and the more freely I make it because cir&#45; the congre<lb/>&#45;cumstances prevent its &#45;gational connections of my friend&#39;s family prevent preclude the possibility of my words from being construed&#44; by<lb/> those who do not know me&#44; into selfish motives.<lb/> either individually a congregationally.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>During our intercourse&#44; our friend my the departed would allude<lb/> occasionally to his sons and dau children&#44; and I who listened<lb/> could perceive the inward emotions which elicited<lb/> the unbidden tear of parental joy.  The last<lb/> time that Dr Heller called on me was the<lb/> New Year which the house of Israel lately<lb/> celebrated.  My venerable visitor said that<lb/> his daughter&#44; whose place of residence is in<lb/> another city&#44; had come&#44; as usual&#44; to spend the<lb/> holiday with him.  &#8220;Ah the Lord has blessed<lb/> me with good children.&#8221; were then his words.<lb/>  I&#44; as a servant of the God who&#44; of all his enun&#45;<lb/>&#45;ciations at Sinai&#44; singled out the fifth&#44; by attach&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing to it a lasting recompense&#44; I tell this to<lb/> the comfort of the bereaved.  May the satis&#45;<lb/>&#45;faction of having contributed to the temporal<lb/> happiness of father and mother prove a source<lb/> of exhaustless consolation.<lb/></p>
            <p>Thou venerable son of our people&#44; go to thy<lb/> celestial reward.  The merciful Being whom<lb/> thou didst often invoke in thy agonies&#44; exclaiming&#58;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#8220;Have pity on me O my God&#44;&#8221; will<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>lend His angels to greet thy coming where<lb/> thy life&#45;companion that thou hast so lamented&#44; preceded<lb/> thee&#44; even &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; in the spiritual realms of the<lb/> holy and the pure whose spirit shines before<lb/> God like the starry firmament ever bright&#44;<lb/> luminous and splendid.  Amen.<lb/></p>
