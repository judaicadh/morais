            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Materialists who deny that God has shapen the human heart to throb with compassion&#44; gloomy<lb/> misanthropes who disbelieve in the existence of human goodness may affect to care nothing indifference for<lb/> the evidences of commiseration and the expressions of condolence but those in the hour of affliction&#44;<lb/> but those who have not studied to crush out of existence the<lb/> noblest part of their nature&#59; creatures who love<lb/> their fellow&#45;mortals&#45;&#45;and thank God they form constitute the<lb/> largest portion bulk of mankind&#45;&#45;&#44; creatures who can weep<lb/> over the misfortune misery of others&#44; and rejoice at other<lb/> people&#39;s happiness&#44; are unutterably indescribably soothed at<lb/> the thought that their own sorrows have opened a cur&#45;<lb/>&#45;rent of human sympathy.  Sympathy that sweet<lb/> sentiment which I call godly heaven like speaks to the soul<lb/> audibly&#44; even though the our lips may do not move.  The ten&#45;<lb/>&#45;der looks have a voice&#59; the very pressure of the hand<lb/> says&#58; &#34;brother&#44; sister&#59; my feelings are stirred&#59; I ea&#45;<lb/>&#45;gerly wish that your anguish pass away&#44; that<lb/> your trouble be relieved&#59;&#34; and such assurances touch<lb/> us deeply&#44; they are most grateful to the sen&#45;<lb/>&#45;sitive.  The wisest moralist expressed this idea<lb/> graphically&#44; when he wrote &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;As in water face answers to face&#44; so does the heart of man<lb/> to man.&#34;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Now&#44; many who can remember this house in<lb/> the near past&#44; and recall the objects who departed<lb/> hence soon to follow each other to the eternal home&#44;<lb/> must be drawn towards the bereaved with fra&#45;<lb/>&#45;ternal compassion.  Specially they must they yearn<lb/> towards one whose unfortunate circumstances have left almost<lb/> solitary to lament over bewail the void losses which her have<lb/> losses repented have created around her a terrible void.  But I am not placed<lb/> beside this coffin&#44; to intensify grief by a recital<lb/> of domestic sorrows&#44; nor do I deem eulogies<lb/> the most effective balm to wounds still <sic>wofully</sic><lb/> sore.  The memory of the dead must be cherished&#59;<lb/> it were unnatural to wipe it away form the ta&#45;<lb/>&#45;blets of the heart.  The virtues of the dead should<lb/> be treasured in our minds&#44; as incentives to good&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness&#59; their imperfections foibles and shortcomings should<lb/> serve as reminders of the weaknesses to which<lb/> all mortals are liable&#44; and which we should<lb/> endeavour to overcome&#44; but the remembrance of a<lb/> lasting separation on earth&#44; must purify not<lb/> consume our existence here below.  There are<lb/> fountains from which consolation does flow&#44; to<lb/> prevent our becoming morally and spiritually withered by sorrows.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>In the present melancholy instance&#44; a source<lb/> of comfort to her who must needs it most&#44; lies in the thoughts of her who has that she<lb/> resignedly suffered with resignation a succession of trials&#44; the full ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;tent of which only the all&#45;seeing eye of God<lb/> has beheld.  Again&#58; the knowledge that the<lb/> years of her widowhood may yet be sweet&#45;<lb/>&#45;ened by the affectionate attention of brothers and<lb/> sister&#59; that&#44; removed from painful surround&#45;<lb/>&#45;ings she may find solace quietness&#44; is a stream whence<lb/> so consolation may well up.  But principally<lb/> a communion with her Maker &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;the God of truth without iniquity&#44;<lb/> who is just and right&#44;&#34; will widen and<lb/> brighten her horizon and she will discover cause<lb/> for calmness solace and contentment.  Compelled no<lb/> more by filial and conjugal duties to devote tax her<lb/> strength to for the mitigation of the bodily ailments<lb/> of dear ones at home&#44; invigorated by a cessation of<lb/> labor&#44; she will direct her energies to works most<lb/> acceptable to the Lord and pleasing and profitable to herself&#44; becoming an angel of charity&#44;<lb/> of mercy and peace wherever her presence and kindly<lb/> ministration be required.  Thus will she honor parents&#44; sis&#45;<lb/>&#45;ter and husband whom the inscrutable decree of God<lb/></p>

            <p>would commanded that she should part with on<lb/> this side of the grave.<lb/></p>
            <p>O Eternal&#33;  We beseech Thee for the sake of Thy<lb/> servant Joseph Silberman&#44; whom Thou hast sum&#45;<lb/>&#45;moned to Thy tribunal.  Dare we believe that he<lb/> who endured physical ills long till the great day<lb/> of pardon had just closed upon us the house of Israel&#44; was auspiciously<lb/> ushered into Thy presence cleansed from all impurities&#63;<lb/>  The secret things belong unto Thee O Lord our God&#44; and<lb/> we shall not presume to ask for a revelation of what<lb/> is beyond human understanding&#44; but we may offer<lb/> ardent supplications.  let it be Thy will&#44; O heavenly<lb/> Judge&#44; we pray that the merits acquired by our brother in faith<lb/> may outweigh his backslidings&#44; and but if neglect of<lb/> sacred obligations should rise to accuse&#44; may grant that the per&#45;<lb/>&#45;formance of righteous deeds&#44; pleading for the soul of the de&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceased&#44; and may win for it Thy Paternal smile and favor<lb/> and grace.  Consoler of the afflicted&#33;  Let Thy bounteous goodness be shown<lb/> to those who mourn&#44; to the sick and to the hap&#45;<lb/>&#45;less&#44; and may the b living praise Thee because they feel that Thou art has been their<lb/> Deliverer Healer&#44; their Protector and savior everlasting Deliverer.  Amen.<lb/></p>
