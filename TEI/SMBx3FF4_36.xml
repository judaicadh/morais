            <p>Boston Ab 26. A. M. 5643.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi>  S. Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>My very dear friend &#38; Zion advocate<lb/></p>
            <p>I am in receipt of your ever welcome<lb/> letter which was <sic>eqully</sic> so to my beloved wife &#38; family<lb/> Thanks to the Almighty God she is progressing most<lb/> favorable all she <sic>fells</sic> we felt would not give<lb/> you a more welcome gutty &#38; <sic>prevalld</sic> upon your<lb/> remaining longer with us but trust that pleasure some<lb/> again.  I am satisfied whatever you do with the Challah<lb/> cloth.  The lad I told you about at the Shule I am sorry<lb/> to say has proved unworthy as well as ungrateful I was<lb/> obliged to send him on to New York to right.  I only trust<lb/> he will not attempt to deceive persons there &#38; perchance<lb/> use my name.  Revd Mr. Phillips was at Shule last<lb/> Sabbath &#38; in course of my remarks I mentioned your<lb/> visit he was sorry he did not see you&#44; tonight he accompd<lb/> by Mrs. Phillips called &#38; bade us good bye.  I asked<lb/> him &#38; all every day &#38; perspints&#91;&#63;&#93; &#38; parted friends &#38;<lb/> bade him do good.  I must also come your pardon<lb/> for not replying to your letter before leaving Philadelphia<lb/> but <sic>If</sic> I had done so our meeting might have<lb/> been prolonged.  Wendell Phillips Oliver Wendel Holmes<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>it would have given me much pleasure to have introduced<lb/> you too&#44; but like Uncle Joe I had so much to talk that<lb/> half what I in intended I forgot it seems almost like<lb/> a dream you visit Enclosed is a small piece cut off<lb/> from a very ancient scroll of our Holy Law which is owned<lb/> by a Mr. David Pulsifer of the State House.  <sic>he</sic> was so<lb/> much <sic>dissapointed</sic> you did not pay him a visit.  I<lb/> took yesterday Sunday two Scribes from &#91;&#63;&#93; to examine<lb/> it we cut off a piece for to forward you if you could not<lb/> give us your opinion about its age &#38;c.  The writing on<lb/> the manuscript &#40;is the same as the scribe wrote our family<lb/> names &#38;c&#41; &#38; the five books of Moses are most complete in<lb/> their wording.  Apropos from what I have read of the<lb/> a<lb/>c in the Jewish Chronicle.  I fancy the M S. of Deuteronomy<lb/> left with the Palestine Fund by Shapira&#44; it was got up for a<lb/> most wicked design in every way in his version it says&#44;<lb/> &#34;Thou shalt not kill the person of they brother.&#34; to imply<lb/> as if we were permitted to kill others&#44; in this barbarous trial<lb/> Just completed&#44; &#38; the Damascus affair&#44; what would they<lb/> haven given to introduce such false testimony.  With the<lb/> kindest love &#38; regards to your dear family in which Mrs.<lb/> Marcus daughter kin unite to you &#38; all dear to you remain Your&#39;s Most truly<lb/> Alfred A. Marcus<lb/></p>
