            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Elisha&#44; journeying on his mission through the land of Israel&#44;<lb/> stopped in the city of Shunem.  A great woman lived there&#44;<lb/> and she urged the prophet to accept her hospitality.  Holy<lb/> Writ does not explain in what the nobleness of the host&#45;<lb/>&#45;ess consisted&#44; but I argue that her generosity towards the<lb/> representative of her religion&#44; and her obvious evident wish to do<lb/> him honor&#44; were for her the epithet applied to her name&#45;<lb/> Isha Gedolah.  Greatness is in Hebrew allied to good&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness.  Abraham was promised a great name&#44; because his<lb/> mission would prove a source of universal blessing  &#91;Hebrew&#93;  Insignificantly<lb/> small&#45;&#45;though rich and lightened&#45;&#45;are the selfish egotistical and ungodly&#59;<lb/> lofty are the large&#45;hearted and pious&#44; even if they are not wealthy and ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;proved of m by fashionable society.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Hearers.  We have gathered round the coffin of a Jewess&#44; who<lb/> possessed the qualities discernible in the woman of Biblical<lb/> times to whom I have referred.  I make this assertion know&#45;<lb/>&#45;ingly.  Not to gratify a pardonable natural sense of family pride self&#45;esteem&#44; nor even<lb/> to allay the sorrow of bereavement.  I say it&#44; but to give virtue<lb/> its due goodness I do not to command sterling worth.  Do not think that I hold the preposterous notion that right&#45;<lb/>&#45;eousness is dying off and wickedness alone survives.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I shall never so malign my fellow creatures&#44;<lb/> but I honestly state&#44; that in my ministerial intercourse<lb/> with the venerable departed I was afforded ample<lb/> opportunities to Judge of her kindly instincts&#44; of her self&#45;<lb/>sacrificing devotion to the ancestral faith and of her respect for its<lb/> exponents.  Is it not moral greatness to promptly respond to<lb/> the calls of humanity&#44; cheerfully to bear privations&#44; so as<lb/> not to deal foully treasonably with one&#39;s belief&#44; and to pay regard<lb/> to God&#39;s servants&#63;  We all may not share the same<lb/> convictions&#44; but one must be destitute of a sense of right&#44;<lb/> who denies persons who that are conscientiously consistent in<lb/> their professions&#44; a meed of praise.  In our days more<lb/> especially are such entitled to our reverence&#44; because<lb/> of the general existing confusion of ideas about what is incum&#45;<lb/>&#45;bent upon the disciples of Moses and the prophets&#44;<lb/> and because that which was formerly adhered to in<lb/> common has become an exceptional practice&#44; and if it<lb/> even does not at times excites derisive comments and ribald jests.<lb/>  I therefore obey my heart&#39;s promptings&#44; when I eulo&#45;<lb/>&#45;gise a Jewess&#44; friendly to the needy and homeless&#44; faithful to her<lb/> creed&#44; unfaltering in her integrity.  The loss is mine  The loss is communal &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> but it is specially principally mine&#44;<lb/> and I feel it as such in all its severity&#44; for with each stroke<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>congregationally received&#44; any courage fails sinks propor&#45;<lb/>&#45;tionately and my mind becomes perplexed.  I counted my<lb/> sister among the unyielding upholders of conservatism&#44;<lb/> attached thereunto by heredity&#44; by associations and by reflect&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion.  Cradled in religiousness and marred wedded to a Hebrew<lb/> singularly notably pious&#44; she had also read nad retained the salu&#45;<lb/>&#45;tary lessons of the Book of books.  To join in the public prayers and<lb/> chant Davidic hymns was her unfeigned delight&#44; to<lb/> listen to words of spiritual advice and useful infor&#45;<lb/>&#45;mation on her people&#39;s history and literature was<lb/> her pleasure.  Conversely&#44; her expressed regret was distance<lb/> and failing health hindering her attendance at the<lb/> public worship on each revolving Sabbath and on<lb/> festivals.  I have just cause in truth reasons to deplore the death<lb/> of H. E.&#45;&#45;though I could not naturally anticipate her<lb/> continuance among the living for a longer series of<lb/> years.  I lament the departure of a woman great in<lb/> her unwavering faith&#45;&#45;a faith which proved a shield&#44; a mighty<lb/> refuge to her soul during sad and repeated trials.  I shall<lb/> not sin by murmuring because the ordinations of the<lb/> Creator have not been reversed in behalf of my venerable<lb/> friend&#44; but in my grief I call upon her children.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>They can gladden me and honor their mother<lb/> best by a conduct demeanour which will enhance her bliss&#44;<lb/> by deeds which will promote the cause of Judaism in its<lb/> purity&#44; elevate the lowly&#44; relieve the sufferers&#44;<lb/> and hasten the era of redemption for the oppressed<lb/> of our race.  Let me implore of you&#44; who<lb/> doubtless desire to leave to your posterity&#44; the inheritance<lb/> of a spotless name in Israel&#59; let me beseech you to educate your<lb/> sons and daughters in a manner inspiring profound<lb/> regard for our belief&#44; and pride in a God Divine&#45;chosen<lb/> ancestry&#44; the heralds of the knowledge of the brotherhood of man and the<lb/> Fatherhood of God.<lb/>  &#40;Here follows a prayer&#41;<lb/></p>
