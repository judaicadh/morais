            <p>Brethren.<lb/>  It was not a <del>foolish</del> groundless boast in which I indulged&#44;<lb/> when I lately <del>said</del> asserted that from this Congregation sprang<lb/> up nearly all the charitable and scholastic insti&#45;<lb/>&#45;tutions existing of a Jewish character&#44; established <del>existing</del>in our city.  I spoke knowingly on the subject.  Thirty two years ago&#44;<lb/> the government of the Hebrah&#44; or Beneficial Society to distribute<lb/> alms among the poor indigent of our faith&#44; was under the control of<lb/> Abraham L. Hart of this congregation.  David Pesoa&#44;<lb/> also one of our members&#44; managed directed then the Fuel Society.<lb/>  The Female benevolent society had I think Mrs<lb/> Jacob Florence Rebecca Hart of this congregation as resident.  The Sunday School Society was superintended by Miss Rebecca Gratz&#44; one of our congregation.  The Chairman of<lb/> the Hebrew Education Society was Solomon Solis&#44; one of<lb/> our members.  Bluma Hart&#44; a Jewess still<lb/> belonging to us&#44; regulated the affairs of the Sewing<lb/> Society.  The Foster&#45;Home Society was organized in<lb/> our Cherry Street Synagogue&#44; and Mrs Anna Allen&#44;<lb/> now enjoying the exercise of all her faculties in her eighty third fourth year<lb/> in the city of New York&#44; but then at that time in our midst&#44; be&#45;<lb/>&#45;came he the first Directress.  But another Society&#44;<lb/> unpretentious and yet calculated to do much good&#44; originated<lb/> also likewise with some youths who attended the worship in our minor sanctuary.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Most active in bringing it about<lb/> was Nathan Wisenstein&#44; who died five years<lb/> ago&#44; in the prime of life&#44; and whom many will<lb/> remember.  Poor he was&#44; and he had compelled to strug&#45;<lb/>&#45;gle hard to earn enough for a daily livelihood&#44; but the<lb/> drawbacks&#44; which hindered his rising into note&#44;<lb/> did not dampen check his ardour zeal in the cause of Judaism<lb/> and of learning.  Besides attending with punctuality<lb/> to his religious duties&#44; never desecrating the Sabbath<lb/> or holidays&#44; and always attending joining in the divine service worship&#45;&#45;;<lb/> besides rendering his gratuitous services gratuitously to our Sunday<lb/> School in imparting the first rudiments of Hebrew&#44; and<lb/> acting as librarian&#44; he urged the formation of a literary<lb/> association.  He In conjunction with others&#44; Nathan Wisenstein succeeded in gathering a number&#44;<lb/> before whom an occasional lecture was delivered&#44; and<lb/> by whom weekly discussions on scriptural and histo&#45;<lb/>&#45;rical subjects topics were held.  In the year 1875<lb/> that humble association emerged from a state of obscurity<lb/> into a one of publicity&#44; full of bright promises.<lb/>  After some spirited meetings&#44; it was re&#45;organized<lb/> under the name of &#34;The Young Men&#39;s Hebrew Association&#34;<lb/> with Mayer Sulzberger&#44; of this congregation&#44; at the head.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Its incipient workings&#44; secured the approval of all who desire the revival of<lb/> our sacred language and literature.  A series of post&#45;Bibli&#45;<lb/>&#45;cal and classical lectures was arranged&#44; and persons qua&#45;<lb/>&#45;lified for the undertaking assumed it.  To encourage<lb/> Jewish talents prizes were offered for the best essays<lb/> on various topics subjects.  Subsequently&#44; a little paper<lb/> called &#34;the Association Review&#44;&#34; was issued monthly&#44;<lb/> and its columns presented very readable matter.  A library<lb/> was established and to it&#44; donations of valuable books<lb/> were liberally made.  A suit of rooms was procured<lb/> in a prominent locality in order with the view to attract draw visitors&#44;<lb/> and it was on its tables home and foreign magazines<lb/> were extensively profusely lay.  What the would&#45;be Jewish<lb/> Orders&#44;&#45;&#45;with the high&#45;sounding child titles of &#34;Sons of the Cove&#45;<lb/>&#45;nant&#44;&#34; &#34;Free&#45;Sons of Israel&#44;&#34; Children of the &#34;Iron Bound&#34;&#45;&#45;professed<lb/> to do and failed to accomplish&#44; seemed to about to speedily have<lb/> its realization in &#34;The Young Men&#39;s Hebrew Association.&#34;<lb/>  It would knit our offspring in sentiments&#44; and<lb/> train them for the defense of their laws and of<lb/> their people.<lb/></p>

            <p>But time that was to have brought an<lb/> increased of usefulness&#44; proved treacherous.  The mildew<lb/> of indifference began to appear grow.  Many of the<lb/> members clearly manifested a preference for what af&#45;<lb/>&#45;fords passing amusement.  Seldom would they be<lb/> seen&#44; except at monthly entertainments&#44; and these<lb/> assumed by degrees a shape at variance with the<lb/> idea originally formed.  I need not say that the blend&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing of the light with the serious is agreeable to human<lb/> reason and not at all opposed to our religion.  Repeatedly I have explained that our religion faith<lb/> does not put on a frown when our youths engage<lb/> in innocent sports.  The music and even the dance may<lb/> not jar with the avowed aim of &#34;The Young Men&#39;s<lb/> Hebrew Association&#34;; but to show annoyance at in&#45;<lb/>&#45;struction&#59; to visit the resort of pleasure and desert<lb/> altogether the place where information on writings<lb/> and writers can be obtained&#44; is surely antagonistic<lb/> to the designated defined object.  The appellation by which<lb/> it goes&#44; would bear me out&#44; if the public utterances<lb/> of its various directors were not sufficiently ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;pressive of the design held in view forth when it<lb/> was created.<lb/></p>

            <p>Last year the active energetic President and his colleagues&#44;<lb/> wishing to impart a fresher impetus to what displayed<lb/> signs of a decline&#44; asked the ministers by a letter an official letter to devote<lb/> the pulpit each Sabbath preceding Passover to the<lb/> advocacy of the Association.  I spoke pleaded then in its be&#45;<lb/>&#45;half and made suggestions&#44; pursuant to the request made several suggestions.<lb/>  I anticipated this week to be applied to again for the<lb/> same purpose.  I was not.  Perhaps last year&#39;s general ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;plication excluded the necessity of a periodical renewal thereof.  But<lb/> perhaps also&#44; the experience of the past severe months<lb/> kept back precluded the request.  For I would offend truth&#44; if<lb/> I declared that during the current term&#44; the shape scope given<lb/> to the Association enhanced it in the estimation of the<lb/> lovers of Judaism.  Its rooms public entertainments&#44;<lb/> which formerly presented notable features recognizable<lb/> as Hebrew&#44; became an absolute travesty defied the sharpest eyes vision to discover them Jewish characteristics.  Christians<lb/> spoke&#44; Christians sang&#44; Christians played&#59; at times in&#45;<lb/>&#45;sipidly&#44; at others trivially&#44; and withal&#44; entailing&#44; I believe&#44;<lb/> in most cases&#44; an expenditure unwarranted by the result.<lb/>  For I hold that when the end in view is not promoted&#44;<lb/> the means employed are <sic>mispent</sic>.  If to pass an evening so&#45;<lb/>ciably is the sole aim of the association&#44; its claims on the support<lb/> of the Hebrews have been forfeited.<lb/></p>

            <p>Moreover&#44; its literary organ&#44; which&#44; after having superseded<lb/> the &#34;Association Review&#34; was heretofore became a bimonthly Bulletin&#44; can<lb/> scarcely be said to issue forth as a Quarterly&#44;&#45;&#45;so irregular<lb/> is its publication&#44; and so difficult it is found to fill<lb/> up its few pages in due season.  Again&#58; The rooms not long ago fitted<lb/> up afresh have not been visited with frequency by<lb/> our youths in quest of instructive volumes.  I have<lb/> happened to go there to consult works I do not pos&#45;<lb/>&#45;sess&#44; and to have fou met no one save the librarian.<lb/>  However&#44; I will not commit an injustice.  The efforts<lb/> of the Young Israelites who accepted to alternate the<lb/> Saturday evening &#34;Informals&#34; with their lectures&#44; deserve<lb/> praise and encouragement.  I myself always interpret<lb/> as an good auspicious omen the voluntary labors of those who&#44; na&#45;<lb/>turally&#44; will succeed us as representatives of the ancient<lb/> Creed.  Whenever such labors are the effect of sober<lb/> thoughts on the needs of the present&#44; and the requisite looking to<lb/> provisions of for the future&#44; we ought to applaud and<lb/> to help and to wish God&#45;speed.  May more than<lb/> five be found six come forth hereafter&#44; to exercise their talents so laudably.<lb/></p>

            <p>But pleasant as it is to find a course of<lb/> satisfaction&#59; glad as I am to give credit to whom<lb/> it is due&#44; I cannot conceal that the failure to carry<lb/> out the primary what should have been proclaimed are<lb/> essential in the working of the Young Men&#39;s Hebrew<lb/> Association&#44; is a great sad disappointment to me.<lb/>  The study of the Hebrew language ought to have ranked<lb/> foremost in the minds of the members of our organization.<lb/>  On it th hinges the permanence of the Synagogue&#44;<lb/> and its distinctive characteristics existence.  I had heard<lb/> that the task was undertaken&#44; and I rejoiced.  I have<lb/> been told that it has been&#44; altogether abandoned and I was pained.<lb/>  Do I then counsel the disbanding of the association&#63;<lb/>  No&#58; he is an untrustworthy physician who cuts off a<lb/> diseased limb&#44; ere he has recourse to all the ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pliances&#44; which may restore it to perfect health its normal state.<lb/>  My mission is to preserve and not to destroy&#44; to<lb/> revive&#44; wherever and whenever decay has appeared.  It were easy<lb/> to say that the Young Men&#39;s Hebrew Association<lb/> has fallen off from its standard.  Let it be cast among<lb/> the recollections of the past.  My wish desire and my prayer<lb/> are that it may live long&#44; but live to and do good.<lb/></p>

            <p>Therefore I earnestly call upon all who&#44; like<lb/> myself&#44; have hopes in our youths&#44; in their natural<lb/> capacities and inborn enthusiasm I beg of<lb/> them to study how to unite our children by<lb/> a combination of the instruction and the pleasing&#59;<lb/> how to interest them in the events which occur<lb/> in the Jewish world&#44; and how to kindle in their hearts<lb/> love for their literature&#59; so that they may be become<lb/> invulnerable to the attacks of the scoffers and the<lb/> agnostors jeers of the skeptics.  If my well&#45;meant appeal is heeded&#44; I may yet have honest reasons<lb/> to cite as a great main factor in that devoutly to be wished for consummation&#44;<lb/> our literary organization&#44; even the Young Men&#39;s Hebrew Association of Philadelphia.<lb/></p>
