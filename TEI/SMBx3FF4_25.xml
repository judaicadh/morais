            <p>Houston&#44; Texas&#44; March 6 1883<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. S. Morais<lb/>
                Rev. &#38; Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I owe you an<lb/> answer to your delightful letter of Jan. 27.  I have<lb/> been sick again&#44; and this&#44; in addition to a want<lb/> of time I must plead as an excuse for not replying<lb/> sooner.  The <del>&#91;&#63;&#93;</del> treacherous climate of this<lb/> southern country has more than once laid me<lb/> prostrate&#44; but I never suffered such agonies<lb/> as I did this time&#44; I had been away&#44; preaching<lb/> in the country.  The day I was gone the thermo<lb/>meter fell from 90&#176; to zero&#44; and the result<lb/> was that I came home with a severe cold<lb/> which settled itself into a malignant affection<lb/> of the throat.  Had I been a boy&#44; the physician<lb/> would not have hesitated to call it diphtheria&#44;<lb/> but as I am a big&#44; strong man it was merely<lb/> a &#34;sore throat&#34; though for a whole night I could<lb/> <del>not</del> barely breathe&#44; and the strongest acids could not<lb/> reduce the swelling&#44; so that my tonsils had to be burned.<lb/>  I am now at work again&#44; but the open air<lb/> is forbidden me for some time.<lb/></p>

            <p>Houston&#44; Texas&#44;&#95;&#95;&#95;188<lb/></p>
            <p>I am informed&#44; that inquiries have been made<lb/> of you by the Denver Hebrew congregation concerning<lb/> my standing &#38; character.  The information comes<lb/> from a private source&#44; and whilst I flatter myself<lb/> with knowing what your answer has been in the<lb/> event of such inquiries having been made&#44; I deem<lb/> it just to inform you&#44; that such inquiries are being<lb/> made without my knowledge&#44; as I have not been<lb/> and am not now a candidate for the position of<lb/> minister in the Denver congregation.  There has been<lb/> some correspondence between myself and the<lb/> secretary of that congregation&#44; the tenor of said<lb/> correspondence being an inquiry as to under<lb/> what conditions I might be induced to apply.<lb/>  I have answered that&#44; in case the position<lb/> affords one a larger field of usefulness than<lb/> I occupy at present&#44; it must seek me&#44; and<lb/> that if the Denver brethren really want me<lb/> they know where to find me.  I was fearful<lb/> of transgressing &#91;Hebrew&#93; knowing that<lb/> Dr. Elkin is the incumbent.  It seems&#44; how&#44;<lb/>ever&#44; that <sic>inspite</sic> of my peremptory refusal<lb/> the officers of the congregation made inquiries<lb/></p>

            <p>concerning me&#44; but I have heard nothing since&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>I am truly glad you approve of my contem&#44;<lb/>plated publication of Al&#39;s life and works.  In<lb/> one point only I differ from you&#44; namely&#44; that I am<lb/> not satisfied in my own mind that M. was not<lb/> in some measure to blame for the desertion of his<lb/> children &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  M. was a pious Hebrew&#44;<lb/> a truly religious man&#44; else he could never have ac&#44;<lb/>complished what he did&#44; but how must we account<lb/> for his daughters becoming Catholics and his son<lb/> Abraham raising his children as Cath protestants&#63;<lb/>  I have often suspected&#45;&#45;to what extent I am right<lb/> I do not know&#45;&#45;that Lessing&#39;s picture of Nathan&#44;<lb/> a Jew&#44; educating a foundling child&#44; Recha&#44; in<lb/> no religion whatever&#44; except teaching her the<lb/> belief in one God&#44; was a mere reproduction<lb/> of M&#39;s homelife.  Abraham Mendelssohn<lb/> wrote to his daughter Fanny on the day of<lb/> the latter&#39;s confirmation&#44; that &#34;she had now<lb/> satisfied all <hi rend="underline">social</hi> claims upon her.&#34;  Was<lb/> that expression of Moses&#39; son an echo of the<lb/> philosophical teachings of the circle that<lb/> visited his father&#63;  It was surely not the out&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>coming of his Jewish education.  In reading over<lb/> the lives of Mendelssohn&#39;s children&#44; one expression<lb/> in particular gave me much pain.  When Moses&#39;<lb/> granddaughter&#44; Deborah Dirichlet&#44; Daughter of<lb/> Abraham&#44; visited Rome&#44; she expressed&#44; in a letter<lb/> to her sister Fanny&#44; her disgust of the gorgeous<lb/> pomp of Catholic worship&#44; by stating&#44; that<lb/> when seeing all this nonsense &#34;she knew<lb/> how much <hi rend="underline">protestant</hi> blood she had in<lb/> her veins&#34;&#33;  And this lady was a pure Jewess&#44;<lb/> because her father Abraham&#44; Al. and her<lb/> mother Leah Solomon&#44; were both Jews&#44;<lb/> well&#44; perhaps it will never be known to what<lb/> extent Moses Al. is himself answerable<lb/> for the change of faith in his children.<lb/>  It is best to say nothing of it&#44; and in my<lb/> book I will make but passing mention of<lb/> the descendants of the &#34;Sage of Dessau&#34; who<lb/> are&#44; with few exceptions&#44; lost to Judaism.<lb/></p>
            <p>I will write to my colleagues concerning the<lb/> remittances.  Your rebuke of Miss. E. L. was excellent.<lb/> Awaiting reply I am truly yours<lb/> Jacob Voorsanger.<lb/></p>
