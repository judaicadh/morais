            <p>In Memory of Samuel Mayer<lb/>
                by<lb/>
                S. Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>Fellow Israelites.  My active presence in this fune&#45;<lb/>&#45;real hall&#44; is simply the interpreter of two sen&#45;<lb/>&#45;timents which the All&#45;Creating God has im&#45;<lb/>&#45;planted in the human breast&#45;&#45;sympathy with<lb/> sorrow&#59; admiration for virtue.  Because those<lb/> inborn sentiments stir within my heart&#44; therefore<lb/> I stand now here&#59; not officially&#44; lest I trespass<lb/> upon others&#39; rights&#44; but in obedience to my<lb/> emotions and in response to the request of<lb/> appreciative friends.<lb/></p>
            <p>My sympathies urge me to lament that an<lb/> irreparable loss has been sustained.  Those<lb/> who are within reach of my voice may perhaps<lb/> wonder and ask themselves&#58; &#34;Was our deceased brother&#44;<lb/> Samuel Mayer&#44; preeminent in the world of letters&#59;<lb/> conspicuous in the world of science&#59; socially<lb/> distinguished to a degree that his demise will<lb/> have created a void difficult to be filled&#63;&#34;<lb/>  Not so&#59; my venerable coreligionist was an<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>unostentatiously quiet son of our people&#59;<lb/> one whose only ambition it was to <sic>fulfil</sic> mo&#45;<lb/>&#45;destly&#59; unpretentiously&#44; the duties devolving<lb/> upon him as a man and a Hebrew.  He<lb/> never laid claim to a position in the world of<lb/> learning.  But there is a world&#44; nearer and<lb/> dearer to all of us than that in which we<lb/> seek honors and celebrity.  There where<lb/> the affections rule&#59; there where <sic>tranquillity</sic><lb/> is enthroned&#44; a most precious world exists.<lb/>  The English language has a sweet mono&#45;<lb/>&#45;syllable expressive of that joyous world&#45;home.<lb/></p>  
            <p>Within its walls Samuel Mayer met<lb/> infinitely more than he missed by being<lb/> unable to mingle in high circles.<lb/></p>
            <p>For years my friend had become incapacitated<lb/> from following his ordinary pursuits&#44; but<lb/> where his children dwelt&#44; he enjoyed com&#45;<lb/>&#45;panionship&#44; comfort&#44; diversions&#59; a miti&#45;<lb/>&#45;gation to physical and moral ills.  Just<lb/> because he valued those God&#45;given blessings&#59;<lb/> because he was the daily recipient thereof&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>therefore his absence from that home will<lb/> create a great void and occasion deep sorrow.<lb/>  I sympathise with all the children of<lb/> Samuel Mayer&#44; but principally&#45;&#45;not invidiously&#45;&#45;<lb/>with his unmarried daughters.  To them the<lb/> constant presence of that father&#44; though weak<lb/> and infirm&#44; needing extraordinary care and<lb/> solicitude&#44; brought delight&#59; for they realized<lb/> that&#44; under Providence&#44; their filial ministra&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion lengthened his days&#44; and that he returned<lb/> the filial offices tenfold by a paternal re&#45;<lb/>&#45;cognition&#59; that is&#44; by unbounded love.<lb/></p>
            <p>Nothing emanating from a mortal being<lb/> will allay the grief experienced&#59; words&#44; <sic>how&#45;<lb/>&#45;ver</sic> sincere&#44; issued from human lips&#44; cannot<lb/> assuage it.  Only the assurances of the<lb/> inspired psalmist will soften the pangs of<lb/> the separation.  When our flesh and our<lb/> heart are mouldering in the grave&#44; our spirit<lb/> is uplifted to the Rock of all ages.  God<lb/> will lead us on by His counsel&#44; and afterward<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>take us up to glory.<lb/></p>
            <p>But I have have said it&#58; My sym&#45;<lb/>&#45;pathy is blended with admiration.  The oc&#45;<lb/>&#45;casional visits which I paid to the home<lb/> of my venerable coreligionist&#44; convinced me<lb/> that virtue is a plant still flourishing<lb/> in the soil of Judaism.  It is not<lb/> withering away&#44; as some pessimists would<lb/> contend.  There is indeed much that<lb/> cannot be commended in the demeanour of<lb/> my people&#59; a vast deal that indicates<lb/> a retrogression&#59; not a progress.  We have<lb/> lost that child&#45;like faith&#59; that abiding<lb/> trust in Providence&#44; that simplicity of<lb/> manners that which distinguished our ancestors&#59; but<lb/> so long as dutifulness to parents is exercised&#44;<lb/> I do not fear a racial decay.  For home<lb/> is the world in miniature&#44; and when that is pure&#44;<lb/> communities can never become thoroughly corrupt.<lb/>  In my official capacity&#44; I have witnessed<lb/> devotion to one&#39;s aged father with pleasurable<lb/> frequency devotion to one&#39;s aged father&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>but never indeed more touchingly&#59; never more<lb/> admirably than in this home.  The sight<lb/> made so profound an impression upon me&#44; that<lb/> had I not been asked to evince friendship<lb/> by some utterances on this melancholy occasion&#44;<lb/> I would have been impelled spontaneously<lb/> to give expression to my feelings&#45;&#45;; so unwearied&#44;<lb/> so tender&#44; so holy was the attention bestowed<lb/> by those daughters on their bodily&#45;enfeebled<lb/> father.  To allay his pains&#44; to watch<lb/> his movements&#44; to anticipate his wishes&#44;<lb/> to suppress heartburnings that he might not<lb/> grieve&#44; to smile upon him that the sun shine<lb/> of their countenances might dispel gloom&#44;<lb/> was the effort of each of those children.<lb/>  And when the hour struck and death seized<lb/> upon that which is its own&#44; the intensity of<lb/> the distress evinced by the offspring of Samuel<lb/> Mayer was a tribute of filial homage<lb/> which I call godly.  Aye&#58; I beheld<lb/> an altar on which a savory offering<lb/></p>

            <p>was laid in honor of the God of Sina&#239; who<lb/> proclaimed &#34;Honor thy father and thy mother.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Fear not kind friends.  Your reward is certain.<lb/>  For Moses declared that the performance of the fifth<lb/> commandment of the Decalogue will give happiness here&#44;<lb/> and felicity hereafter.  &#34;Thy days will be long and it will<lb/> be well with thee.&#34;  Weep for the loss that<lb/> you have sustained&#44; but rejoice that your tears do not flow<lb/> from a source of repentance&#59; from a spring of remorse&#44; at<lb/> having offended your Creator&#44; by running counter to His<lb/> behests&#44; to rash headlong after worldly cravings and<lb/> the gratification of egotism.  My sympathies<lb/> are with you&#44; but my admiration for virtue&#44; incites me<lb/> to set you up as an ensign to all who have old<lb/> fathers and mothers to revere.  Let the conscious&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness of having done your full duty bring to you content&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment.  Look back upon this day&#44; not with increasing dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;tress&#44; but with the belief that because you prolongued your pa&#45;<lb/>&#45;rent&#39;s life&#44; the Lord will lengthen yours to a sacred purpose&#44;<lb/> and with the assurance that the entrance of the dear departed into<lb/> Paradise&#44; will be greeted by a chorus of angels and archangels&#44; who<lb/> sing hymns to the Universal Parent&#59; our God and Saviour.  Amen.<lb/></p>
