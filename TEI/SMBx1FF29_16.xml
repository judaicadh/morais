            <p>Miss Rebecca Moss<lb/>
            Phila December 2d 1870<lb/>
            Dear Friend<lb/></p>
            <p>With much feeling you father described to me the void<lb/> which the demise of your aunt has occasioned in your uncle.  My friends&#39;<lb/> grief struck a sympathetic chord and I felt prompted to offer you&#44;<lb/> but especially those who have been most sadly bereaved my sincere condolences.<lb/>  May I ask that you will be the interpreter of my sentiments&#63;  The living word<lb/> possesses a power which can never be transferred to writing.  Hence my<lb/> request&#44; which you will doubtless effectively perform.  I desire to say<lb/> to your cousins and their afflicted father&#44; that to shed tears because of<lb/> the departure from earth of objects dearly loved is to pay a tribute due<lb/> to nature&#44; but that Israelites must cast a trusting love beyond their<lb/> narrow bounds.  A scene bright and joyous would then open before our vision.  For the truth of immortality has been written in letters<lb/> of fore on God&#39;s hand &#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; it is stamped on the depth of the human<lb/> soul&#44; and the pages of the volumes given for our g&#91;&#63;&#93; proclaim<lb/> it loudly.  Would we but consider that nothing in the values of<lb/> creation is lost&#44; and that what appears to our carrel eyes to have<lb/> died away&#44; is reproduced in a new form.  That our beneficent<lb/> Mother has breathed within us a longing for an endless hereafter&#44; and<lb/> that is to be gathered to one&#39;s fathers&#34; is a celestial promise to the<lb/> a&#91;&#63;&#93;ght&#44; we would then cease to lament.  Our sorrows would<lb/> be greatly assuaged&#59; our bereavements would be borne with pious serenity.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>age&#58; the instrument whose &#91;&#63;&#93;ations caused us much delight<lb/> may break&#44; but the harmonious strains it evoked exists.  In like<lb/> manner&#44; the body may moulder in the grave&#44; but the mind<lb/> which compelled it to rest&#44; will live everlastingly.  To<lb/> doubt it is to disbelieve the power&#44; the justice&#44; nay&#44; the<lb/> existence of that adorable Being in whose image we were created.<lb/>  Happy those who can carry &#91;&#63;&#93; the consciousness of having<lb/> employed their faculties nobly.  I learn that<lb/> your deceased aunt was adorned with many virtues.  Let the<lb/> memory thereof speak <sic>consolatively</sic> to the sorrows.  Her<lb/> good deeds will be her advocates before the throne of grace&#44; and will<lb/> also &#91;&#63;&#93; the blessing of the Almighty for her offspring<lb/> and her husband.  Such is her wish I beg you will convey<lb/> to your sorrowing relatives&#44; while I subscribe myself<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours truly<lb/>
            S. Morais<lb/></p>

            Revd. S Morais<lb/>
                &#124;Confidential&#124;<lb/>
            My Dear Sir.<lb/></p>
            <p>I thank you kindly for<lb/> the attention yesterday &#38; regret I was sent<lb/> home to report to you in confidence the doings<lb/> or rather misdoings on the melancholy occasion of<lb/> the funeral of Mr. F on Sunday last.<lb/></p>
            <p>Mrs F lead &#38; joined in her children<lb/> &#40;two daughters &#38; one son&#41; that the ceremonies of<lb/> cutting their garments &#38; sitting in th evenings<lb/> should be omitted.  My cousin Mr Revd.<lb/> Jaques said he had prepared an English<lb/> discourse&#44; highly extolling the numerous<lb/> excellent qualities of the character of<lb/> the lamented deceased.  Format of which<lb/> was a heart &#38; ear &#38; an open parse&#91;&#63;&#93; for<lb/> the pair or distressed &#38; such a Mother&#33;&#33;<lb/></p>  
            <p>These children seem to be almost<lb/> inconsolable &#38; totally deprived of the<lb/> soothing which the Revd. J might have<lb/> contributed to &#38; I know experience the neglect<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>I doubt not you know or have heard<lb/> of Aa&#91;&#63;&#93;&#44; world wide character<lb/> for charity &#38; many other good qualities<lb/></p>
            <p>Rebecca the eldest daughter&#44; as also Emma<lb/> &#38; Jo&#44; are you know &#40;I said children&#41;<lb/> are adults &#38; full of comprehension<lb/> &#38; appreciation &#38; If you could at your<lb/> leisure&#44; write to the young Ladies&#44; as you<lb/> so well konw how to&#44; a consolatory &#38; appro<lb/>&#45;priate letter it would be saving me greatly<lb/> because it would supply the defect<lb/> that bigotry only has imbued &#38; perhaps<lb/> the want of ability that exists in<lb/> my cousin the Revd. I. And as they<lb/> are girls of superior minds&#44; I feel<lb/> convinced that it will prove as balm<lb/> to their souls.<lb/></p>
            <p>I trust you &#38; family are<lb/>
                well.<lb/>		Yours very sincerely.<lb/>
            
            	J L Moss<lb/></p>
                
                <p>Their father.<lb/>
