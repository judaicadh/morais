                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>A funeral address.<lb/></p>
            <p>The utterance of grief&#44; flowing spontaneously&#44; when&#44; but<lb/> nine days ago&#44; I stood beside the coffin of a De Casseres&#44;<lb/> will not resound upon this occasion.  Melancholy in&#45;<lb/>&#45;deed is the present occurrence&#44; because the departure of those<lb/> with whom we have held a pleasing intercourse is always<lb/> painful.  They specially must deem the separation<lb/> lamentable&#44; who were wont to read abiding love in the<lb/> eyes just closed in death.  But reason unites now<lb/> with religion&#44; and both appeal soothingly to the bereaved.<lb/>  For&#44; the latter became not the orphaned children of a<lb/> parent&#44; whose labor was essential to their subsistence.<lb/>  A sentiment commendable in every man&#44; incited Benjamin<lb/> De Casseres to daily exertions&#44; despite the gentle remon&#45;<lb/>&#45;strances of his sons and daughters.  But had he chosen<lb/> to enjoy rest&#44; he might have secured it among<lb/> a filially attached offspring.  He might have created<lb/> in their midst a noble rivalry&#44; to supply the wants<lb/> and anticipate the desires of their father.  My deceased<lb/> friend preferred constant endeavours to inactive ease.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>But consolatory it must be to know that by<lb/> his demise none has been left without support.  Con&#45;<lb/>&#45;solatory is the thought&#44; that the father&#45;&#45;though not<lb/> old&#45;&#45;lived to see his dearest and nearest&#44; outgrow the age<lb/> of parental dependence.  But that feeling will surely<lb/> be intensified by the remembrance of duty well performed.<lb/>  My lamented brother felt that God had laid within his<lb/> reach an inestimable blessing&#44; and so greatly did he<lb/> prize it&#44; that it seemed to afford him delight to speak thereof&#44;<lb/> and with much frequency to refer to it.  Aye&#58; children<lb/> of the departed&#33;  It was on your dutifulness that this<lb/> fortunate father prided himself.  And it is the consciousness<lb/> of the same virtue&#44; that should breathe a heavenly comfort<lb/> into your souls.  When five years ago&#44; he&#44;&#45;&#45;a devoted<lb/> husband&#45;&#45;was doomed to consign to the cold grave<lb/> the companion of his youth&#44; he met in each of you al&#45;<lb/>&#45;leviation to his sorrow.  Alike in your presence and absence as in<lb/> your absence presence he would cite as fillially exemplary his<lb/> Rachel and Miriam&#44; his Elias and Rebecca&#44; all those<lb/> to whom Louisa De Casseres had given birth&#44; that the<lb/> latter days of his existence might be sweetened.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>Reason therefore counsels you all to forbear wailing.  Be&#45;<lb/>cause you are free from the sing stings of remorse&#44; piercing<lb/> the heart of many an ungrateful child.  Also because none<lb/> of you needed any more the direct assistance and attention<lb/> of him that has quitted the earth&#59; and&#45;&#45;reflect on this&#45;&#45;<lb/> because he has been spared a menacing disease&#44; of a<lb/> nature too shocking to endure&#44; and too fearful to con&#45;<lb/>&#45;template.<lb/></p>
            <p>But religion moreover suasivley addresses you at this doleful mournful<lb/> hour.  It recalls a life which&#45;&#45;if not sinless&#45;&#45;high merits<lb/> redeemed from destruction.  Religion assuages your pains<lb/> by the assurance that fidelity to those whom we are called<lb/> to serve will be rewarded &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;They who<lb/> act with faithfulness are God&#39;s pleasure.&#34;  There is one who will<lb/> ever bear witness to your father&#39;s observance to his trust&#44;<lb/> and teach his posterity to respect the memory of Benjamin<lb/> De Casseres.  No slight virtue&#44; my friends&#33; in any age&#44; to<lb/> work truthfully&#44; but remarkable&#44; when the pollution of false<lb/> dealing has very nigh become a prevailing of peace.<lb/>  But as rare as the merit to which I have just alluded&#44; was<lb/> another possessed by my late friend.  He loved the worship<lb/> offered to the Lord by the community of his brethren&#44; in simplicity of manners<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>and he heartily joined therein.  To be privileged to raise<lb/> the scroll of the Law in the eyes of the congregation of Jacob&#44;<lb/> be considered an honor.  To sing the praises of the Almighty<lb/> in the language of David and Ezra&#44; he esteemed a righteous<lb/> exercise.  Advocating&#44; possibly&#44; changes&#44; which&#44; according to<lb/> his judgment&#44; might be permissible&#44; he still upheld the<lb/> ancient ritual&#44; because opposed from principles and from training<lb/> to innovations antagonistic to Judaism.  He made common<lb/> cause with his conservative fellow&#45;believers&#44; and sought oppor&#45;<lb/>tunities&#44; by which his fondness of practices which time has hallowed&#44;<lb/> might be made obvious.  In a word&#58; my friend was a Jew not<lb/> merely by name and the casualty of birth&#44; but by preference and<lb/> affiliation.  All this the ancestral religion pictures now to<lb/> your minds&#44; O children of the departed&#33; and its representation<lb/> aims at reaching a twofold object.  It holds out the promise<lb/> of a heavenly recompense&#44; that you may be consoled in this<lb/> terrestrial separation &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;it will be well unto those<lb/> that fear God&#44;&#34; and it invites you to keep alive the name you<lb/> have inherited by improving on rather than degenerating from<lb/> the paternal example.  At your hands&#44; relatives of my friend&#33; our<lb/> faith demands adherence to the moral precepts of Sinai&#44; conformity to cere&#45;<lb/>&#45;monial statutes of an equally divine origin&#44; and the copying of the social amenities<lb/> and the urbanity and kindness by which Benjamin De Casseres was ever distinguished.<lb/></p>
