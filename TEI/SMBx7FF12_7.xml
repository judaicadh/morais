            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>
                PHILADELPHIA&#44; PA.<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Wednesday June 2. 97<lb/></p>
            <p>My Dear Nina<lb/></p>
            <p>By this time you know <del>why</del> what I did<lb/> not write about last Saturday night.  In the morning&#44;<lb/> I rose early&#44; as I generally rise on Saturday&#44; for fear of<lb/> oversleeping myself&#44; and taking up the <hi rend="underline">Ledger</hi>&#44; read<lb/> to my horror&#44; that Eugene had been run over by a<lb/> wild horse&#44; while he was riding his <sic>bycicle</sic>.  At first&#44; said<lb/> the paper&#44; he was thought to have died&#44; but he gained<lb/> his <sic>conscienciousness</sic> and was taken to the German hospital&#44; where<lb/> he still remains&#44; and where&#44; I am afraid&#44; he will be<lb/> obliged to stay for some time.  Providentially&#44; he did<lb/> not break any of his limbs&#44; as all feared&#59; but his knee cap<lb/> was very badly hurt&#44; and all his body was fearfully<lb/> bruised.  Esther went to see him early on Saturday<lb/> and each of us&#44; visited him&#44; in turn.<lb/></p>
            <p>The paper stated that his wife was very ill&#44; and I&#44; who<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>had not received any intimation to that effect&#44; was<lb/> perfectly shocked.  I went to see Rebecca in the even&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing and found her dreadfully agitated.  The physician<lb/> had told her that Eugene had broken his legs&#44; for such<lb/> was the general impression.  I saw her again yesterday&#44;<lb/> after having visited Eugene&#44; and she appeared more composed.<lb/>  Just a year ago&#44; I feared that I would lose her.  She<lb/> has been very unfortunate&#44; since she left my roof.  Let<lb/> us hope that the future will be happier.<lb/></p>
            <p>The weather here is also wintry&#44; and report says that<lb/> vegetation has suffered.  A great pity&#44; for the whole<lb/> or nearly all the month of May had been good.<lb/>  I went to N.Y. on Sunday&#44; but did not find time to<lb/> call at E. 63<hi rend="sup">d</hi>&#44; 159.  Your Biblical questions<lb/> I shall try to answer in my next&#44; which must unavoid&#45;<lb/>&#45;ably be written only on Monday night next.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rebecca is naturally very anxious to see her husband&#44; and the<lb/> doctor promised to take her in a carriage&#44; as soon as he<lb/> considers it safe to do so.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am happy that you rejoice over house keeping.  I am tired<lb/> of our house keeping&#44; on account of the accursed <hi rend="underline">owner</hi>.<lb/></p>
            <p>I suppose that the girls will write before me<lb/> much love<lb/> SM<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Of course&#44; I would advise your attending worship&#44; tho&#39; differing from my views&#44; but I would also advise to be aware of the wheel.<lb/></p>
