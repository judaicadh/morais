            <p>Houston&#44; Texas&#44; March 20 1883<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. S. Morais&#44; Philadelphia<lb/>
                Rev &#38; Dear sir<lb/></p>
            <p>Your esteemed favor<lb/> of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is at hand &#44;and I gladly take a few<lb/> moments from my day&#39;s work to reply.  I am<lb/> very thankful for your kind words&#44; concerning<lb/> the <del>prof</del> expression of opinion&#44; that may be probably<lb/> asked of you.  I learn that Dr. E. Schreiber of<lb/> Mobile has been elected to the Denver pulpit&#44;<lb/> and this should set all rumors concerning my<lb/> candidature at rest.  I thoroughly agree with<lb/> you that constant changes do not benefit<lb/> a minister&#39;s reputation&#44; and as long as I<lb/> see not any way a head to a tangible improve&#44;<lb/>ment in my condition I propose to stay<lb/> right where I am&#44; for my people are as ever<lb/> kind&#44; liberal&#44; and not disposed to fault&#44;<lb/>finding.  I am known here&#44; and have many<lb/> friends&#44; and it is hardly possible&#44; that&#44; unless<lb/> the contingency&#44; hinted at in your letter&#44; pres&#44;<lb/>ents itself next year&#44; that Houston will<lb/> be my home for at least the next five<lb/> years.<lb/></p>

                Box 319.<lb/></p>
            <p>Houston&#44; Texas&#44;&#45;&#45;&#45;188<lb/></p>
            <p>I am obliged to you for the quotation from Moses<lb/> Dessau&#39;s &#91;Hebrew&#93; to his &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But permit me to re&#44;<lb/>mark&#44; merely as a matter of argument&#44; that<lb/> that paragraph merely proves&#44; what is corro&#44;<lb/>borated by Mendelssohn&#39;s Jewish historians&#44;<lb/> Gratz&#44; Kayserling and others&#44; that Solomon<lb/> Dubno came to Berlin after Mendelssohn&#39;s<lb/> <hi rend="underline">German</hi> translation had already been published.<lb/>  The &#91;Hebrew&#93; was to explain to the orthodox world<lb/> his position concerning the scriptures&#44; and in this<lb/> he was materially aided by this self&#45;same<lb/> Dubno&#44; who&#44; by the way only taught his young&#44;<lb/>est son Alexander &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;&#44;<lb/> and another Polish Talmudist&#44; named Herz<lb/> Hamburg.  As I stated I have never doubted<lb/> his purity&#44; but the cause of his son Abraham<lb/> and of his daughters is a riddle to me.  Alex&#44;<lb/>ander&#44; the one taught by Dubno&#44; never left<lb/> the religion of his father&#44; and his descendants<lb/> are to&#45;day public&#45;spirited Jews in Berlin&#44;<lb/> at least this I infer from Mr. Hensel&#39;s<lb/> wonderful silence on this branch of the<lb/> family.  Hensel&#39;s &#34;Mendelssohn family&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>&#40;3<lb/></p>
            <p>is merely a glorification of such descendants&#44;<lb/> of M&#39;s&#44; who broke with Judaism.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am much interested in your gallant fight ag&#44;<lb/>ainst the attempt to make of Spinoza a martyr.<lb/>  That there are elements in Spinoza&#39;s philosophy<lb/> that challenge admiration is incontestible&#91;sic&#33;&#93;&#44; espec&#44;<lb/>ially his accounting for the good and evil pro&#44;<lb/>pensities in man&#39;s nature.
