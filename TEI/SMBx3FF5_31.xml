            <p>Rev. S. Morais&#44;
                My dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>Your kind and welcome<lb/> favor of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month reached me in due<lb/> course of mail&#44; but upon its arrival I was as yet<lb/> scarcely strong enough to send you a suitable reply.<lb/> I have been&#44; if not  &#34;sick unto death&#34; so very near<lb/> to it that I prayed &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#33; I felt<lb/> myself in grave danger&#44; though my good Doctor<lb/> derided the &#94; idea. After delirium came weakness&#44;<lb/> but I am now&#44; thanks to our  Father in Heaven&#44; en<lb/>tirely restored&#44; and feel my old vigorous strength<lb/> gradually&#44; though a little slowly&#44; returning. I<lb/> thank you for your kind sympathy.<lb/></p>
            <p>I proceed to reply to your letter &#91;Hebrew&#93;  etc.<lb/> I was&#44; indeed&#44; myself under the impression<lb/> that I would be called to a larger field of<lb/> usefulness. Results proved my impressions<lb/> erroneous. I never felt any disappointment<lb/> at not obtaining the position in question&#44; much<lb/> as that may seem a paradox&#44; for I am known<lb/> to be ambitious. The fact is&#44; I felt myself<lb/> hardly prepared to enter a field of such<lb/></p>

            <p>magnitude. I still need&#44; perhaps not as much the<lb/> scholastic training&#44; as the earnestness of settled<lb/> manhood and the deliberateness that proceeds<lb/> from settled convictions. I am still a very young<lb/> man&#44; more fit to sit at the feet of masters<lb/> and to learn&#44; than to teach multitudes. I have<lb/> never known that my leaving college two years before<lb/> my time was a fatal error until the world began<lb/> to test my knowledge and my activity. I have&#44; to the<lb/> full extent of my power&#44; supplied these lost&#91;&#63;&#93; years<lb/> by ten years of hard study and the severest<lb/> self&#45;application&#44; and yet I have done myself<lb/> not as much good in these many years as<lb/> my teachers&#44; Heaven bless them&#44; could have<lb/> done in two. Well&#44; though I left college a<lb/> raw recruit&#44; I have&#44; I think&#44;  not been un<lb/>worthy of the men&#44; who when I sat under<lb/> them in the &#91;Hebrew&#93; thought more of me<lb/> than I ever will become. In the days after<lb/> my illness&#44; when I was weak and helpless&#44;<lb/> the scenes of my youth came back to me<lb/> with unwanted force&#44; and a longing to see <lb/> the dear old faces came over me&#44; that for<lb/></p>

            <p>a few hours made me  melancholic.

            <p>cial cities give one more encouragement than is<lb/> expected. In my case I was received with much<lb/> confidence.  My faults were soon known&#44; yet the<lb/> congregation bore with them.

            <p>One who was inhaled the air of a Beth<lb/> Hammedrash in Amsterdam cannot be<lb/> otherwise. I am really no reformer in the<lb/> sense your German rationalists apply<lb/> the term. But I have come to that point&#44;<lb/> where I make a distinction between forma&#45;<lb/>lism and  pure religion. There I have&#44; I know&#44;<lb/> departed from the beaten track. I was<lb/> taught that Talmudical Rabbinism was<lb/> the logical and historical sequence of proph&#45;<lb/>etic Judaism&#44; and that the subsequent Rab&#45;<lb/>binism of the Rishonim and Aharonim&#44; <lb/> and Kabbalism as well&#44; were the logical<lb/>outcomings of Talmudism&#44; to use that<lb/> term for a moment. My personal investiga&#45;<lb/>tions have overthrown the position that was<lb/> impressed on me in my youth. I see now in<lb/> the legal Halachas of the Talmud nothing<lb/> that should be&#44; or ought to be&#44; binding<lb/> on citizens of any country&#44; for they are<lb/> the sum total of the legal <hi rend="underline">codex</hi> by<lb/> which a Jewish Senate governed the<lb/> second Jewish commonwealth.

            <p>I correct&#63; The fact that the Rabbis built<lb/> their legal conclusions upon Scriptural<lb/> inferences is nothing to me&#59; I need not tell<lb/> you how often a single iota is made to be<lb/> the warrant for Scriptural authority. As to<lb/> the Agadis portion of the Talmud I concede<lb/> that we cannot do without it. It explains<lb/> the Bible. Now&#44; will you not grant me that<lb/> <del>the</del> post&#45;Talmudic Rabbinism was the<lb/>sequence of a doctrine that the legal deci&#45;<lb/>sions of the Talmud were  binding for<lb/> all times&#63; The Jews in their Ghetto&#44; given<lb/> the right to be governed according to their own<lb/> laws&#44; made the Talmud the basis of their<lb/> jurisprudence&#44; and piles upon piles of<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; are nothing but commentaries<lb/> upon&#44; or revisions of Ghetto jurisprudence.<lb/> Am I right&#63; And then this Talmudical<lb/> jurisprudence was&#44; like <del>as</del> in the theocra&#45;<lb/>tic commonwealth&#44; made a parcel<lb/> of religion&#44; and &#91;Hebrew&#93; was<lb/> replaced by the &#91;Hebrew&#93; for all who<lb/> were recreant to their forced condition.<lb/></p>

Subsequently Kabbalism arose&#44; and<lb/> you will permit me to treat it&#44; I know&#44; as the<lb/> invention of a crafty Spaniard&#44; not as a<lb/> revelation to Shimon ben Jokai.
