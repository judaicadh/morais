            <p>To the President and Board of Trustees of the Jewish Theological Seminary<lb/></p>
            <p>Gentlemen<lb/></p>
            <p>From the various reports periodically submitted to me by the<lb/> two preceptors of the Seminary &#45; Drs. Drachman and Lieberman&#45;&#45;I understand that its<lb/> scholastic condition affords general satisfaction.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>I recently visited the institution several times&#44; and I was<lb/> gratified to hear a number of pupils answer well&#44; questions relative to Biblical&#44;<lb/> historical and Rabbinical books&#44; in such parts as are taught at present&#44; suitably to<lb/> our printed curriculum.  Naturally&#44; some are of a higher&#44; others of a lower degree<lb/> of intelligence.  Some&#44; again&#44; who were admitted when already grown to manhood&#44; or<lb/> nearly reaching that stage&#44; do not come up to the expectations formed.  In fact&#44;<lb/> a few have already left&#44; and&#44; I regret to state&#44; without giving any previous notice<lb/> of their intention to withdraw&#44;&#45;&#45;a manner of proceedings obviously unbecoming.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>This seems to warn us against allowing any outside pressure<lb/> to cause the admission of youths&#44; whose age and condition in life do not offer a fair<lb/> prospect of their steadily pursuing a course of study in the Seminary and remaining<lb/> till its completion.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Twice during my visits in inclemency of the weather<lb/> affected the attendance.  <sic>Absenticism</sic> is an evil of which complaint is made by the<lb/> preceptors&#44; and if allowed to go unchecked&#44; it may greatly hamper the instruction&#44;<lb/> and demoralize the classes.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>An important need is an occasional visitation at the<lb/> pupils&#39; residences&#44; even at the secular schools which they frequent.  That need ought<lb/> to be attended to by the president of the Faculty&#44; but as my twofold position precludes<lb/> me from doing that part of my duty&#44; I earnestly wish that some of my colleagues&#44; living<lb/> in New York would perform it in my stead.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Until we are in a position to have the scholars more immediate&#45;<lb/>ly under our supervision&#44; the knowledge of their surroundings and of their habits is<lb/> indispensable.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Recently some of the students have prepared essays&#44; which<lb/> I shall examine as soon as it lies in my power.  Dr. Cyrus Adler delivered&#44;<lb/> not long ago&#44; an archeological lecture in which the attendants at the Seminary were<lb/> interested.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Though scarcely within the range of my obligations&#44; I<lb/> beg leave to call your attention to the necessity of communicating with the various<lb/> congregations&#44; by means of your Secretary&#44; concerning the payment of dues.  I learn that<lb/> those in Philadelphia have not been addressed to that effect.  Very essential it is also<lb/> to foster the creation of branches of the Seminary Association&#44; as in this city.  On<lb/> that subject&#44; I have just written a letter to Baltimore&#44; asking whether my presence&#44;<lb/> or exhortations might accomplish the same end.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>Hoping that our strenuous endeavors may vastly promote<lb/> the Jewish cause we have at heart&#44; I subscribe myself<lb/> Yours very <sic>r espectfully</sic>&#44;<lb/> S. MORAIS<lb/></p>
