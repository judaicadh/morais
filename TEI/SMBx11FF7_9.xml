            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Sympathising friends.  Only one regret can be<lb/> experienced in the present instance&#44; and even that<lb/> melancholy feeling is greatly tempered in its pain&#45;<lb/>fulness.  Certainly&#44; had our venerable sister<lb/> in faith&#44; now enshrined in this coffin&#44; been su&#45;<lb/>&#45;pernaturally consulted&#59; had she been asked where<lb/> she would prefer to surrender her spirit to the God<lb/> that gave it&#44; she would have pointed to the city of her<lb/> love&#44; and the home of her choice.  Yet&#44; regrettable<lb/> as her absence from thence at her demise must unavoid&#45;<lb/>&#45;ably be&#59; sorrowful as some will feel that her last<lb/> breath was heaved up in a home not her own&#44; and<lb/> in a city wherein she did not habitually dwell&#44; the<lb/> circumstance is nevertheless attended with pleasurable<lb/> reflections.  The bed chamber whence the invisible<lb/> bridge was stretched which conveyed the immortal part<lb/> to its region&#44; was not that of strangers.  The eyes<lb/> which looked upon Isabella Cauffman&#44; when her<lb/> eyes closed in death&#44; were those of object dear to her<lb/> heart.  Relatives and friends surrounded her couch&#44; at<lb/> the hour in which Providence decreed that she should<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>leave the depart from earth.  Nor is that circum&#45;<lb/>&#45;stance the sole cause of satisfaction to the living&#44; who<lb/> mourn by reason of the deep affection&#44; which they bore<lb/> the deceased.  They must remember that our vene&#45;<lb/>&#45;rable sister in faith left Philadelphia ten days ago<lb/> to <sic>fulfil</sic> a wish which she had long cherished.  Was<lb/> it the presentiment of a final separation from<lb/> some to whom she had proved a mother&#44; and from<lb/> others who had grown to womanhood under her im&#45;<lb/>&#45;mediate vision&#44; that took her to New York&#63;  I shall<lb/> not venture an answer on that insoluble question.<lb/>  Suffice that her desire was gratified.  A warm<lb/> greeting met her arrival in the midst of those&#44;<lb/> who were anxious to show that time had not<lb/> erased the memory of benefactions.  And she&#44; led<lb/> on by joyful emotions&#44; forgot her age&#44; and<lb/> braved inclement weather to go among the<lb/> offspring of many who had experienced her kind&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness.  There she was overtaken by the<lb/> angel&#44; bid to transfer her soul to serener<lb/> realms.  Short and painless was the<lb/> transition&#44; and now what is perishable&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>has been returned to the city of our sister&#39;s love&#44;<lb/> to be carried form the home which gave her comforts<lb/> to the spot she had destined for her remains.<lb/>  Tears and the solemnity of prayer will be the tribute<lb/> paid to the venerable one who has gone.<lb/></p>
            <p>With these consolatory reflections&#44; I might end my address.<lb/>  But as pastor of the Congregation to which the deceased<lb/> always belonged&#44; I feel that words of thankfulness are<lb/> not inappropriate&#44; that they ought to flow from my<lb/> lips.  When Marcus Cauffman lived&#44; the<lb/> hallowed habitation dedicated to the worship of Israel&#39;s<lb/> God&#44; saw the husband and his wife&#45;&#45;since I entered<lb/> the ministry&#45;&#45;occupy their seats on each revolving<lb/> Sabbath.  When fifteen years ago&#44; Isabella Cauffman<lb/> remained a was widowed of her companion&#44; her attendance continued steadily.<lb/>  Only in proportion as the burden of more than ten score<lb/> years and ten bent her form&#44; her visits to the Synago&#45;<lb/>&#45;gue became less frequent.  But with the approaching<lb/> of the most solemn season in the Jewish calendar&#44;<lb/> fresh vigour seemed to be imparted to her frame.<lb/>  I then beheld her coming to the sacred shrine&#44; and<lb/> remarked her remaining there in fasting and<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>orisons the entire day of atonement.<lb/>  This year she joined in the service to a still later<lb/> date.  She was in her seat two Sabbaths ago&#44; and when<lb/> I paid my respects to her in the afternoon&#44; she announ&#45;<lb/>&#45;ced to me her determination to procure herself the<lb/> pleasure of seeing once more her N. Y. friends.<lb/>  The Sanctuary&#44; to whose repair and embellishment she<lb/> had recently contributed&#44; will not find Isabella Cauffman<lb/> any more&#44; but her reverential sentiments towards it&#44;<lb/> will have gained for her spirit admission into a<lb/> still holier Tabernacle&#44; where saints abide etern&#45;<lb/>&#45;ally.  Her motherly demeanour towards many<lb/> whose claims on her benevolence were not those im&#45;<lb/>&#45;posed by nature&#44; but by generous impulses&#44; will<lb/> have secured to her soul joys in the presence of<lb/> that God&#44; whose attributes are loving&#45;kindness<lb/> and righteousness.  That it will be even so&#44;<lb/> I trust in the Lord of truth.  Him I beseech to<lb/> forgive trespasses and overlook shortcomings.  For<lb/> to err is human&#44; and none will appear before<lb/> their Maker from sin.  &#40;Here follows a prayer&#41;<lb/></p>
