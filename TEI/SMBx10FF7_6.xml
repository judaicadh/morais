            <p>It was partly published in the Jewish Record as an editorial<lb/>
                for Succot&#44; in 5640.</p>
            <p>Beautiful is the feast of tabernacles.  It has not the majestic solemn&#45;<lb/>&#45;ity of the days just celebrated&#59; yet it partakes of their imposing<lb/> character sanctity&#59; while it imparts to the mind peculiar freshness and<lb/> elasticity.  The Our sacred season harmonizes with nature.  The sear leaves<lb/> dropping on all sides&#44; as we pass on&#44; speak in grave accents&#59; the<lb/> azure sky and the mellowing sun&#45;beams&#44; invite to joyfulness.<lb/>  A blending it is of light and shade&#44; as it were&#44; in our feelings&#44; which the<lb/> revealed word of God calls forth&#44; and the silent language of His<lb/> handiwork softly breathes in.  Israel has been enjoined to hold<lb/> now a celebration brimful of gladness&#59; but withal earnestly devotional<lb/> So we read in Deuteronomy &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;A feast of tabernacles<lb/> thou shalt keep for thyself&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Thou shalt rejoice in thy feast&#34;<lb/> And immediately after the holy book uses the following expression.<lb/>  &#34;Seven days shalt thou keep a feast for the Lord Thy God&#34; Do these sentences<lb/> stand in open contradiction&#63;  Not at all&#44; my Brethren&#33;  They illustrate<lb/> the character of the faith in which we have been born.  That faith<lb/> recognizes in the purity of man&#39;s intentions thoughts&#44; a sublime act of reve&#45;<lb/>&#45;rence to the Divinity.  In the same manner as we pay homage<lb/> to the Supreme&#44; when deeply impressed with the grandeur of His crea&#45;<lb/>tion.  In the same manner as our heavenly Benefactors accepts<lb/></p>

            <p>with favor the pious sentiments awakened by the appearance of<lb/> the rich tapestry which covered fields and meadows&#44; and by the luxuriant<lb/> colours&#44; which shrubs and trees display&#44; so it will likewise be pleasing<lb/> in His sight&#44; when we relinquish our habitual callings&#44; and enjoy in His name<lb/> a season of content&#44; sharing with our dear ones&#44; and the needy blessings which<lb/> He has bestowed.  That is the sacred hinge on which Judaism turns.<lb/>  Our righteous intentions give glory to God our Maker.  They are unto<lb/> Him the most savory of human offerings &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  To fast in honor of<lb/> God&#44; to eat in honor of God if conducive to the end intended by the wise Lawgiver will be equally accounted to our merit.  Hence&#44;<lb/> the Biblical passage which calls this celebration Israel&#39;s feast&#44; de&#45;<lb/>&#45;clares it also to be a feast of the Lord.  Often we are taunted<lb/> with being a people wanting in void of spirituality.  You have heard that as&#45;<lb/>&#45;persion cast upon us by many hostile to our faith.  They will say that<lb/> Jews celebrate almost every occasion with a repast on wines and viands.  We acknowledge<lb/> the correctness of the charge.  Still&#44; we do not blush.  The vaunted<lb/> spirituality which consists in affecting contempt indifference for the world and<lb/> the goods the Almighty dispenses therein is not a sentiment harbored in the<lb/> Jewish breast.  An Israelite voluntarily and gladly abstains<lb/> from any all food&#44; when he believes he <sic>fulfils</sic> by it a direction of<lb/> his God&#59; but he indulges participates in convivial gatherings&#44; because he rejoices<lb/> in the gifts of the Most High.  And mark this Dour detractors&#33;<lb/>  Having upon his lips a benediction to the merciful Donor&#44; an Israelite<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>never turns his festivals or festivities into drunken revelries.<lb/>  Is that want of spirituality&#63;  Let them taunt&#44; my Brethren&#33;<lb/>  Our Succot not less than our Kippur has an elevating character.<lb/>  The holy convocation in the Synagogue&#44; the historic tabernacle stretched<lb/> beyond it&#59; aye&#58; the family choicer meal domestically enjoyed amidst time&#45;ho&#45;<lb/>&#45;nored hymns and orisons render it&#44; what the Scriptures term it a feast<lb/> to ourselves&#44; yet glorious to the Lord.  In that manner we will yearly<lb/> celebrate it.  May it have the effect&#44; which the autumnal<lb/> season&#44; wherewith it harmonizes creates on the thoughtful&#44; inten&#45;<lb/>&#45;sifying our love for the Parent of all good&#44; and reminding us of<lb/> our precarious tenure of life&#44; which like the booth temporarily erected<lb/> may soon be removed taken away.  Then we shall rise from the latter with<lb/> hearts subdued&#59; with an earnest wish that the parting rays of our every stage<lb/> existence of life may soften human asperities&#44; and ripen good&#45;will with<lb/> brotherly affection.<lb/></p>
            <p>Beautiful is this holiday&#44; my dear friends&#33; because beautiful<lb/> is the religion which has commanded it.  Only ignorance and prejudice<lb/> call material&#44; what teems with soul&#45;ennobling lessons.  En&#45;<lb/>deavour to understand these&#44; that you may not be carried away<lb/> from us by false impressions.  For much of the lukewarmness<lb/> we observe among the youths of this century&#44; proceeds either from unacquaintance with  or from a<lb/> misapprehension of the book&#44; whence we derive the knowledge<lb/></p>

            <p>of duty.  The Psalmist asserted that because he made it a<lb/> continual study&#44; therefore he became wiser than his enemies &#91;Hebrew&#93; Your<lb/> minds&#44; will expand&#44; through the teaching daily received.  Both sacred<lb/> and secular learning will contribute to widen the range of your<lb/> thoughts.  The more proficiency you gain therein&#44; the more honor you<lb/> will shed on Judaism.  For the faith of your fathers has nothing to<lb/> fear from sound knowledge.  But as your ideas rise and<lb/> assert their power&#44; let them be brought under a wise guidance.<lb/>  Like David reflect on the wonderful volume which contains the<lb/> history of your people&#44; and the will of your God.  Even as nature<lb/> reveals a creative Intelligence&#44; from which all spring up&#44; so will<lb/> a meditation of the Bible&#44; present to your views the working of the same<lb/> creative Intelligence&#44; that is God&#44; who rules and rewards man&#44; provides for<lb/> the world with mercy&#44; and chastens its inhabitants with justice.  You<lb/> will be Jews&#44; because you have seen the outstretched arm of the Lord rescue<lb/> the oppressed.  You will be Jews&#44; because in every link of in the chain of<lb/> the past will fasten your hearts to the present.  And when the festivals<lb/> which are an everlasting testimony of Divine Protection to our race come<lb/> around&#44; you will gladly join your brethren in singing&#44; hallelujahs<lb/> to the Keeper of Israel&#44; who neither sleeps2 nor slumbers1.<lb/></p>
