            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Stand in awe and sin not.&#34;  Thus speaks death unto all<lb/> of us&#44; children of the dust&#33;  But its voice so powerful&#44;<lb/> when issuing from the coffin&#44; wherein a friend lies enshrouded&#44;<lb/> ceases to be heard&#44; amid the tumult of the passions.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;My feelings are buoyant&#44; I am yet vigorous&#44; time has scared left<lb/> &#34;its impress upon my brow.  Will I also&#44; for sooth&#44; be made to moulder<lb/> &#34;in the grave&#63;  No&#44; that fear shall not check the flight of<lb/> my ambition.  The cup of pleasures must be overflowing&#44; ere I<lb/> &#34;relinquish my decisions.&#34;  But&#44; why so much recklessness Oh man&#33;<lb/>  Knowest thou not that life is but a span&#63;  To&#45;morrow the<lb/> earth may see thee no more.  And that unbounded future to which<lb/> thou hast preferred the fleeting present&#44; will open and terrify thy<lb/> vision.  Friends&#33;  It is even so.  In running the race of<lb/> life&#44; we heedlessly trample upon whatsoever might hinder our<lb/> course.  And if at times&#44; we are compelled to halt and survey the<lb/> ground we are treading&#44; we still refuse to retrace our steps.  Pride<lb/> goads us on&#59; and to it we sacrifice the dictates of religion&#44; parental<lb/> precept and example&#44; the instincts of the heart&#59; the calls of humanity.<lb/>  Death&#44; I therefore say&#44; is a goodly mentor.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Could we but constantly hold before our mind&#44; how much misery<lb/> we would spare ourselves and our fellow&#45;mortals&#33;  The thought<lb/> that we may soon be summoned by the Great Judge&#44; would keep us within<lb/> the salutary bounds of moderation.  It would restrain excesses&#44; the indul&#45;<lb/>&#45;gence of appetites&#44; and of irregular pursuits.  That thought&#44; remind&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing us of a common origin and a common termination to all<lb/> mankind&#44; would soften our feelings for all who suffer.  <sic>we</sic> would<lb/> &#34;bring the poor that are cast out to the our house&#59; when we see the<lb/> naked we would convey him&#44; and never hide our eyes from our own<lb/> flesh.&#34;  It is a maxim of the Sages of antiquity that the<lb/> contemplation of death&#44; is the safeguard of virtue.<lb/></p>
                <p>Brethren&#33;  I hold it up to your vision.  Observe it well&#44; that<lb/> its memory may not be quickly effaced.  The vicissitudes under&#45;<lb/>&#45;gone by our lamented friend&#44; whose remains we surround&#44; are<lb/> in themselves a volume of instruction.  Ponder thereon.  You will<lb/> learn the instability of fortune&#44; and the uncertainty of retaining<lb/> the health of the body&#44; and the powers of the mind.  But you<lb/> will draw therefrom also a lesson that surpasses all value&#58; to<lb/> be tranquil amid reverses&#44; and resigned to the decree of Him&#44; who<lb/> &#34;doth not afflict willingly&#44; nor causelessly grieve the children of men.&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>For thus was Lyon J. Levy sustained amidst distressing events.<lb/>  The genial temperament that distinguished him in the days of<lb/> prosperity&#44; was not ruffled by dire adversity.  And though slack<lb/> in the performance of some of the divine commands&#44; he still trusted<lb/> but in the Redeemer of Israel&#44; and blessed the Being who chastens<lb/> &#34;as a father chaseneth.&#34;  When incurable infirmities were<lb/> followed by the loss of wealth&#44; and this by the demise of a relative&#44;<lb/> a friend&#44; and commercial associate&#59; he submissively bowed to the<lb/> celestial fiat.  It pained him that he could no more with a<lb/> liberal hand aid his fellow&#45;creature&#44; but to his last hour he proved<lb/> that the untold sorrows had not seared the heart which had bent<lb/> with sympathy and charity.  To reward those noble traits<lb/> of character&#44; God bid an angel administer to his wants&#44; and<lb/> allay his suffering.  The unwearied and unwavering watchfulness<lb/> of her who had shared his joys&#44; aye&#44; the sweet endearments of<lb/> a wife&#44; cast a radiance around his existence.  The brightness<lb/> of the past&#44; seemed to him scarcely to have been dimmed.<lb/>  So contentedly he lived for almost ten full years.  Like a drooping<lb/> flower plant&#44; which a lovely hand tends&#44; that it may not soon die&#44;<lb/> so was our friend tended by his life co&#45;partner.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>And only when human affection and solicitude proved<lb/> unavailing&#44; he sunk in the arms of death.  Let us<lb/> hope&#44; that he has awakened in the realms of bliss.<lb/>  Let us pray that a merciful God may forgive the errors<lb/> of the mind&#44; and reward the generous impulses of the heart&#59;<lb/> that He may pass over the transgressions caused by the<lb/> cravings of the flesh&#44; remembering that man&#39;s nature is but<lb/> weak and frail.  With uplifted hands let to the Dweller<lb/> of heaven&#44; let us ask that the balm of consolation may be<lb/> poured on the afflicted relict of Lyon J. Levy.  That the<lb/> knowledge of her unbounded devotion&#44; and the consciousness<lb/> of having fulfilled her duties with unremitting perseverance&#44; her connubial<lb/> duties&#44; may relieve the intensity of her grief&#44; and inspire<lb/> her with deeper reverence for the Almighty Creator&#44; in whose<lb/> presence&#44; her is beloved is now&#44; we trust&#44; angelically beatified.<lb/></p>
