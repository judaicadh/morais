                PRESIDENT.		SECRETARY.			TREASURER.	AGENT.<lb/></p>
            <p>ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH IMMIGRANTS.<lb/></p>

            <p>Rev. Dr. S. Morais&#44;<lb/>	
                Esteemed doctor&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>It has come to my<lb/> knowledge that the Russian Anarchists of the<lb/> down town section of this city contemplate<lb/> a ball and parade on <hi rend="underline">Yom Kipur</hi> day<lb/> and night&#44; and that serious trouble is expected.<lb/>  I went to the head men&#44; and am glad to<lb/> report that it had been decided at last<lb/> evening&#39;s meeting not only to dispense with<lb/> the parade but also with the ball.<lb/></p>
            <p>Now there is some special reason for the<lb/> change&#44; beside the remonstrances of the more<lb/> wise among the unwise ones&#44; or &#34;cranks&#44;&#34; and<lb/> that is chiefly the approaching trials of the<lb/> two mis&#45;leaders&#44; Premier and Staller.<lb/>  They are averse of exciting public antipathy<lb/> just now&#44; and they are going to call on<lb/> me&#44; to make some corrections in the<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>jargon from where a reporter represented<lb/> me as if mis&#45;stating the celebrated inciting<lb/> &#34;speech&#34; of Premier at one of the meetings<lb/> when I was present.  I am willing to<lb/> rectify the wrong&#44; and let the naked<lb/> truth speak for itself.<lb/></p>
            <p>There is one thing however which re<lb/>quires some attention in connection with these<lb/> holiday orgies&#44; in which I desire to seek<lb/> your advice.  I am told that some of<lb/> the Carmelites are going to &#34;celebrate&#34;<lb/> the day of Atonement in an anarchistic<lb/> fashion&#44; and this must be stopped&#44; not so<lb/> much perhaps for the sake of the vicious<lb/> few &#40;or&#44; I would call them unfortunates&#41;&#44; as for<lb/> the name of the Russian Jew&#44; and the colony<lb/> especially.  I intend to go over there and<lb/> try to dispel their nightmare of irreligion<lb/> and indecent defiance of what is fair<lb/> in humanity&#44; and hope to dissuade them<lb/> from any demonstrations which can hurt<lb/> the chances of the wavering colony more<lb/> than anything else.  If you suggest another<lb/> plan&#44; or if you desire to admonish the people<lb/> in writing I would be only too happy to<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>hear of it.<lb/></p>
            <p>As to my personal matters I have no<lb/> intention to trouble you any further&#44; although<lb/> I must confess that my short acquaintance<lb/> with you has <sic>plantend</sic> seeds of love and admiration<lb/> which at present are only tempered by the<lb/> melancholy thought that your slight con<lb/>fidence in me may have suffered from<lb/> other people&#39;s impressing upon you their<lb/> doubts and suspicion as to my sincerity.<lb/>  I simply desire to assure you that while<lb/> there is of necessity much truth in what<lb/> ever my good friends speak about me&#44;<lb/> the interpretation of it is quite a<lb/> different thing.<lb/></p>
            <p>As the day approaches on which we<lb/> are called to repent and forgive I have<lb/> a strong desire to confess to you&#44; father<lb/> minister&#44; that taking the supreme Being<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>whom I adore and worship in prayers every<lb/> day&#44; to stand before as before the Supreme<lb/> Judge I say that I am innocent of any<lb/> crime&#44; and am as honorable in my dealings<lb/> <del>with</del> with other persons as is necessary for<lb/> an honorable man or husband to be.  I have<lb/> told you the whole truth&#44; and nothing but<lb/> the truth when I invited you to use your<lb/> blessed influence with my wife.  As to<lb/> my relations with the latter I can say that<lb/> I loved her more than the ordinary husband<lb/> can do.  I have rarely called her by name&#44;<lb/> but used the words&#58; &#34;angel&#44;&#34; &#34;love&#44;&#34; &#34;darling&#34;<lb/> etc.&#44; only her own strange conduct has really<lb/> created a strange change in me&#44; and we<lb/> could no longer live peacefully for the<lb/> last few months.  There was much to censure<lb/> in me&#44; and I would have paid dearly to<lb/> have those faults removed&#44; and my heart<lb/> restored to love&#44; and satisfactory treatment<lb/> of the mother of my child&#44; but fate has<lb/> done it&#44; and I stand convicted of rash<lb/> and rough actions toward one whom I should<lb/> have tried to pacify and otherwise comfort<lb/></p>
            <p>My desire to reconciliation did not spring<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="5"/>
            <p>from any other but sincere motives to<lb/> restore our former relations&#44; to have the<lb/> children cared for&#44; in a measure at least&#44;<lb/> and to allay the surprise of the community<lb/> at the frequent <sic>occurences</sic> of conjugal troubles<lb/> among the Russians.<lb/></p>
            <p>I thank you&#44; doctor&#44; for what you have<lb/> been endeavoring to do&#59; and I hope that<lb/> you at least will not condemn me on<lb/> suspicion and other people&#39;s distrust.<lb/></p>
            <p>With my highest regards&#44; and<lb/> sincere wishes for a happy New Year&#44;<lb/> I remain&#44; dear doctor&#44;<lb/> Yours&#44; very respectfully<lb/> Geo. Randorf<lb/></p>
            <p>P. S. I have resigned my Agency of above<lb/> Ass&#39;n&#44; and hope to find something else in its stead.<lb/></p>
