            <p>a funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>Are the funeral rites a tribute of respect to the dead&#44; or a token<lb/> of our sympathies for the surviving relatives&#63;  This is an<lb/> open question among the Sages of Israel&#44; and they who entertain<lb/> either view find support in Biblical authority.  I myself<lb/> presume to assert that the religious ceremony ought to be<lb/> the exponent of both sentiments.  The Our beloved departed must<lb/> need rejoice in spirit when solemnity shall mark the<lb/> consigning of their bodies to mother&#45;earth.  They must be<lb/> glad that the precious casket which held the secret spring<lb/> of immortality&#44; is laid down with due becoming reverence.  And to the<lb/> aching hearts of the bereaved&#44; prayer must surely bring alleviation.  The<lb/> words which the servant of God speaks in the name of the compassionate<lb/> Lord Master&#44; will draw forth the tears relieving pent&#45;up grief.<lb/>  Yes&#44; my kind hearers&#33;  Alike for the living and for the dead are the<lb/> obsequies intended which we habitually perform.  The cynical<lb/> philosophy that sees in the lifeless body form we so much cherished nothing commanding<lb/> our regard&#44; can have but few Disciples among the progeny of<lb/> Abraham.  Influenced by the example of the father of our people&#44;<lb/> we experience as he did at the demise of his fondly loved Sarah&#44; we experience&#44; I say&#44; an ardent wish to give the our dear dead an honored<lb/> burial.  And because we are taught to believe&#44; that to<lb/></p>

            <p>comfort the mourners is a duty and a merit&#44; we seek<lb/> their presence that we may prove our sympathies.<lb/>  Such feelings and such motives&#44; I believe&#44; are at work within<lb/> the minds of those that have entered this hall now overcast with gloom.<lb/>  For she who will e carried hence to her grave&#44; was confessedly the<lb/> estimable mother of dutiful children.  She labored in the sphere assigned<lb/> to her by Providence with a steadfastness that elicited universal com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mendation.  The city which loses an individual morally<lb/> spotless&#44; has just cause for lamentation&#59; since the virtues displayed<lb/> by the members of the community are its defence and its ornament.<lb/>  The congregation&#44; that has been deprived of a faithful adherent&#44;<lb/> may well deprecate the event&#44; is an indication of its waning<lb/> strength.  But the household bereft of the guide&#44; that gently<lb/> led it to prosperity and success&#44; must bewail and sorrow for&#44; as<lb/> for the befalling of a severe dire calamity.  And so is in very<lb/> deed the decease of Mrs Mayer Arnold felt by her numerous<lb/> offspring.  True&#58; They have all become self&#45;dependent&#44; but they<lb/> had never outgrown the necessity of listening to her counsel&#44; they<lb/> never could relinquish the privilege <sic>profitting</sic> by her unwearied<lb/> exertions.  Those among her sons and daughters enjoyed the<lb/> fruits of her kindly efforts most more immediately&#44; who had continued in her residence&#44;<lb/> and in the city she dwelt in&#44; but the pulsations of her maternal<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>heart&#44; quickened at the thought of all whom she bore<lb/> to her ever lamented husband.  Unto all of them was her<lb/> affection exhibited with an intensity which time could only deepened.  Did<lb/> she not illustrate with great sublimity the she harbored&#63; her actions set in a clear light the sentiments  she cherished&#63;  Lo&#33;<lb/> her children&#39;s children rise and attest the full power of her love.<lb/>  When age rapidly stole upon her&#44; when health pe sensibly failed&#44;<lb/> self&#45;denial abnegation still held possession of her spirit.  She forgot the care<lb/> of self to promote the happiness of her descendants.  But a<lb/> week ago&#44; her mind studied perhaps how to heighten the enjoy&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment of the young ones&#44; that climb up she clasped to her throbbing bosom.<lb/>  Absorbed in the pursuit of goodness&#44;<lb/> she procured saw not death fast advancing toward her&#44; yet&#44; when his icy<lb/> hand was felt&#44; she understood the summons&#44; and unmurmuringly<lb/> prepared for the departure.  All honor&#44; my Brethren&#33;<lb/> to so excellent a parent.  And in justice to the dead&#44; let<lb/> me add&#44; as a lesson to the living.  All honor to the memory<lb/> of a Jewess&#44; who in every relation of life retained a character illustra&#45;<lb/>&#45;tive of that name.  Mrs Arnold&#44; as the wife of my late<lb/> venerable friend&#44; exemplified the qualities by the which Holy Writ<lb/> distinguishes a virtuous wife woman.  Chastity and retiring mo&#45; was mirrored in her<lb/> &#45;desty were her traits demeanour&#44; thrift and industry claimed her as their bright<lb/> representative.  As a sister&#44; she retained the warmth of<lb/> sentiments imbibed in early childhood.  And as far as consistent with<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>the discharge of more weighty obligations&#44; she labored to fasten the ties of nature&#44;<lb/> by the interchange of kindness.  As a member of the social family&#44;<lb/> she unostentatiously contributed to the welfare of the needy and<lb/> hapless&#44; always preferring retiring modesty in the distribution of<lb/> her gifts&#44; to conspicuity.  Such was in life our sister in faith&#44; and<lb/> we recognizing her worth&#44; desire to pay her a last tribute of respect&#44;<lb/> while condoling with her mourners.  We will follow her mortal remains&#44;<lb/> and solemnly deposit them in their resting place.  But will we<lb/> also follow the footprints she left in her earthly path&#63;  Look to<lb/> them&#44; my Brethren&#33;  But you specially for whom those traces were marked out&#44; incline<lb/> your steps to the way you should walk.  Your mother&#39;s domestic virtues&#44; constitute<lb/> her richest legacy.  Sons and daughters of this sainted being&#33;  Value what has<lb/> been bequeathed as your joint property.  Let all of you f benefit by the example.<lb/>  Let your motto be henceforth&#44; self&#45;denial of each for the happiness of all.  Bring to<lb/> a common centre all the powers severally possessed&#44; that the advantage may be equally<lb/> shared.  Let him that can advise&#44; exercise his faculties on behalf of the others.  Let<lb/> her that can physically aid&#44; bend to it her will.  Let those who can procure<lb/> comfort or pleasure&#44; call forth their energies to compass that end.  Your mother<lb/> will watch your actions.  The unity of feelings&#44; the harmony prevailing among<lb/> her children&#44; will enhance her heavenly bliss.  And prayfully will she ask of<lb/> her God to shower down blessing on your heads &#38;c &#38;c &#38;c<lb/></p>
