            <p>Philadelphia&#44; Dec. 14&#44; 1896.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. Dr. B. Felsenthal&#44;<lb/>
                Dear Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your favor has just come to hand.  Since you<lb/> ask about the works of Luzzato &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; permit me to mention that the<lb/> son of the late Professor&#44; Isaiah Dr.&#44; inquired about you&#44; and I<lb/> answered that you reside in Chicago&#44; I am not a pupil of the<lb/> celebrated literati.  I was born at Livorno &#40;Leghorn&#41; and studied<lb/> with Chief Rabbi Ab B. Pisserno &#91;Hebrew&#93; but Luzzatto&#39;s writings are&#44;<lb/> of course&#44; known to every Italian student.  I remember having seen<lb/> a manuscript copy of his commentary on Isaiah&#44; when I was quite a<lb/> youth.  I have&#44; however&#44; corresponded with my great compatriot and<lb/> coreligionist &#38; I wrote a very brief and imperfect biography of<lb/> his character and labors&#44; shortly after his death&#44; and which ap&#45;<lb/>peared in the Occident&#44; and was reproduced in the Jewish Chronicles&#44;<lb/> &#40;London&#41;.  Having noticed in an Italian journal that his posthumous<lb/> works were about to be published&#44; I requested his son to send me a<lb/> copy of his Pentateuch&#44; Isaiah&#44; Italian Bible&#44; and some other minor<lb/> productions of his pen in my native language.  I wrote immediately<lb/> an article in the Record&#44; a paper to which I contribute&#44; with the<lb/> view of inducing my colleagues to benefit the family of the deceased<lb/> by purchasing his books.  I have obtained these&#44; save the &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> which has not yet been issued&#44; all through the post office&#44; an expens&#45;<lb/>ive mode of getting foreign works&#44; but the only of which I knew&#44; not<lb/> wishing to trouble private individuals.  I expect five copies of the<lb/> <sic>Tentateuch</sic> and one of the Isaiah&#44; for persons who bespoke them here.<lb/>  If you wish&#44; I will communicate with the Dr. at Padua&#44; and report<lb/> your request.  At all events&#44; I enclose a list&#44; which may serve as a<lb/> guide regarding prices&#44; etc.<lb/></p>
            <p>And now since I had the pleasure of forming your<lb/> acquaintance by letter&#44; allow me to seek a favor at your hands.  This<lb/> week I wrote to a youth&#44; formerly an attendant at my Synagogue&#44; and<lb/> begged that he would make some inquiries about the standing and repu&#45;<lb/>tation of a certain Samuel Maggiar.  This man has an Italian wife in<lb/> Alexandria &#40;Egypt&#41;.  After having consumed her property&#44; deserted her<lb/> and the son she bore to him&#44; and came to America &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  He is<lb/> <sic>is</sic> reported to be in your city.  Lately he made an attempt to return<lb/> home&#44; but the parents of the deserted&#44; persons of respectability and<lb/> means&#44; are anxious to learn beforehand whether present circumstances<lb/> would warrant their <sic>gorgiving</sic> the past&#44; and delivering again a loved<lb/> child into the hands of an unprincipled fellow.  No doubt&#44; you are<lb/> more likely to find out&#44; than Solomon Sulzberger of the firm Lindauer<lb/> &#38; Bros. Co.&#44; to whom I wrote and sent the man&#39;s photograph.  I hear<lb/> that the deserter is a constant attendant at the Synagogue&#59; you may<lb/> therefore&#44; without great difficulty&#44; discover his whereabouts and con&#45;<lb/>dition.  Say nothing to him&#44; but have the kindness to drop me a line&#44;<lb/> and believe&#44; that I will be ready to reciprocate your kindness.<lb/>  Very truly&#44;<lb/> S. Morais.<lb/>
                546 North 5th St.<lb/></p>
