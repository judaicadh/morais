            <p>Brethren.  I have not forgotten that my promise<lb/> has been fulfilled&#44; only partially.  The third subjects<lb/> of the series which I considered it might be of some use<lb/> to deliver&#44; remains yet untouched.  To escape the charge<lb/> of neglect&#44; I might speak of numerous calls on my time&#44;<lb/> within and without the line of a minister&#39;s duty.  But<lb/> in all reality the direct cause of the delay is one&#44; which I<lb/> must summon courage to fight and conquer.  It is the<lb/> fear of approaching at all a question more abstruse than<lb/> even that of the existence of God or Revelation&#44; which I have<lb/> already discussed at some length.  For while the first&#45;<lb/>named has Creation for its testimony &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; and the second<lb/> can point to the permanence of Israel as its clear evi&#45;<lb/>&#45;dence &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; the immortality of the soul is a metaphysical<lb/> abstraction.  It has indeed a close connection with the<lb/> idea we hold of Divine Justice and a heavenly teaching&#44; but<lb/> to explain it in a lucid and persuasive manner&#59; to set<lb/> forth in popular language reasons and arguments which<lb/> will carry home convictions to unprejudiced minds&#44; is a<lb/> task of no light weight.  I shall nevertheless<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>bend under it&#44; and produce before long the result<lb/> of my best endeavours.<lb/></p>
            <p>To day I will draw a moral from current events.  Not<lb/> because I am ambitious to be thought an habitual croaker&#44;<lb/> not for the sake of complaining do I relate what sounds<lb/> as a censure and not as a praise.  It would be an<lb/> abuse and perversion of the privileges which the pul&#45;<lb/>&#45;pit confers&#44; to present the dark side of humanity.<lb/>  But my vocation requires that I keep watch over the<lb/> interest of my people Israel&#44; and I see fit therefore<lb/> to report now and then to my charges what happens<lb/> within the Jewish fold.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear hearers.  A sudden change has taken place in our midst.<lb/>  They who were satisfied with themselves are now crest&#45;<lb/>fallen.  You will remember that in the days of Jere&#45;<lb/>&#45;miah&#44; when he uttered laments because the word of<lb/> the Lord in the month of the true had become a reproach&#44;<lb/> many <sic>travelled</sic> about and professed to be Doctors.  I<lb/> will let the man of Anathoth himself tell what he<lb/> noticed.  &#34;Both prophet and priest have acted falsely.<lb/>  They have cured very easily the breach of my people&#44; by<lb/> saying &#39;it will be well&#44; all well&#44;&#39; but it it is not well&#34;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>A similar thing occurred with us previous to the Anti&#45;<lb/>semitic agitation in learned Germany.  Doctors hailing<lb/> principally from that civilized land&#44; gave us the assurance<lb/> that notwithstanding the occasional breach of peace in<lb/> benighted countries against our suffering brethren&#44; Jews were<lb/> all right&#44; where the light of progress had diffused its genial<lb/> heat.  The reign of equality had been there firmly set<lb/> up.  No doubts need be entertained any more about a<lb/> steady advancement.  But now one of those Doctors<lb/> comes forward &#38; of his own accord makes this doleful confession.<lb/>  &#39;The cosmopolitan era of our vision is still very far&#59; the<lb/> deluge of barbarism is not over yet.&#34;  At that ingenious<lb/> acknowledgment I recall the recommendation of the Rabbis<lb/> and recognizing its wisdom&#44; exclaim as directed &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Whatever God does is for the best.&#34;  I<lb/> myself did not require the outburst of fanaticism which<lb/> startled Europe and free America to satisfy me that Israel&#39;s<lb/> salvation must proceed from the Lord and not from speculative<lb/> science and experimental philosophy.

            <p>have rushed into the seductive arms of &#34;Rationalism&#34; will<lb/> draw back abashed and confused&#44; ready to lend a willing<lb/> ear to the lessons of Mosaism.  They will do so if they<lb/> only carefully study incidents affecting their own race.<lb/>  It is perhaps my misfortune to come across with pa&#45;<lb/>&#45;pers that keep alive in my breast a feeling of insecurity<lb/> about the enjoyment of our rights where Gentilism pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;vails.  I would delight to read that not retro&#45;<lb/>&#45;gression but progress is the sight offered by nations<lb/> who pride themselves in having humanized the world.<lb/>  But I do not see it&#44; and I cannot deceive myself<lb/> and those who have appointed me as their sentinel.<lb/></p>
            <p>Since 1867 when Austria reconciliated Hungary<lb/> over whom she had long domineered&#44; by swearing to main&#45;<lb/>&#45;tain her new constitution&#44; the union of the two peoples im&#45;<lb/>&#45;proved very greatly the condition of the Jewish inhabitants.<lb/>  Liberties denied heretofore were granted.  The avenues to<lb/> civil and political preferments were opened to all.<lb/>  Colleges and seminaries are being presided over by men&#44; not<lb/> long ago shut up in distinct localities.  Those who worship in<lb/> a synagogue&#44; sit at present in council with the devotees of the<lb/> church.  The statute&#45;book has warranted the permanence<lb/></p>

            <p>of this gratifying state of affairs.  But evil example<lb/> is contagious&#44; specially so when viewed from a short distance.<lb/>  The fire of prejudice that raged in Berlin could not fail to re&#45;<lb/>&#45;kindle the <sic>smouldering</sic> embers of fanaticism in cities lying<lb/> by the Danube.  What if the new Constitution possesses<lb/> broad folds to cover up Jews from danger&#59; the old can be<lb/> revived to expose them to injury.  For it suits our ene&#45;<lb/>&#45;mies to invoke ancient authorities&#44; when the will of the popu&#45;<lb/>&#45;lace sides therewith.<lb/></p>
            <p>In &#91;&#63;&#93; of Hungary live an Israelite called Felix Kronstein and<lb/> his wife.  The latter originally belonged to the Roman church&#44;<lb/> but&#44; as not infrequently in countries&#44; where freedom dazzles our people<lb/> and blinds them to their real interest&#59; to a future domestic happiness&#44;<lb/> the Jew married the christian.  It has been asserted that she<lb/> voluntarily accepted our religion by going through the process en&#45;<lb/>&#45;joined by the laws for the admission of a female proselyte.<lb/>  At all events&#44; at the birth of her first son&#44; she agreed to her husband&#39;s<lb/> wishes.  The boy must enter the Abrahamic covenant&#44; and be<lb/> raised as an Israelite.  How great the surprise when the<lb/> local Rabbi who had been invited to participate in the ceremony&#44;<lb/> dissuaded the pair from publicly taking that step&#44; lest ill&#45;will<lb/> be stirred up against our race.  He assured them that their<lb/></p>

            <p>marriage would be condemned by the law&#44; and their child<lb/> taken away.  But did they not live in that Hungary<lb/> emancipated and liberal&#63;  The father of the child<lb/> shocked and incensed would test the case.  He applies<lb/> to a magistrate&#44; who refers him him to the chief clerk<lb/> of the courts.  This promises to communicate with him<lb/> very soon&#44; and state what the rules actually were.  Felix<lb/> Kronstein receives from Pesth an official document signed by<lb/> the authorities.  In it the Jew is plainly told that the<lb/> woman he abides with is not his lawful wife&#44; that her<lb/> conversion is null and void&#44; for she dared not exchange<lb/> Catholicism for Judaism&#59; that the union between two persons<lb/> of different creeds is not considered valid in Hungary&#44; that<lb/> a Rabbi must not venture to bring it about&#44; and that the<lb/> child belongs to the Church.  Within three days its mother<lb/> must it have it baptised to prevent the exercise of legal force.<lb/>  Our Hungarian coreligionists have not quietly submitted to<lb/> so high&#45;handed a measure&#59; to so flagrant a breach of the<lb/> constitution guaranteeing freedom of conscience.  They appealed<lb/> to the Minister of Worship&#45;&#45;the officer so called in lands&#44; having<lb/> an established religion.  And as that official confirmed the<lb/></p>

            <p>decision of the temporal powers&#44; they have brought their<lb/> wrongs before the bar of public opinion&#44; and doubtless they will<lb/> not rest until those wrongs are redressed.  The journal<lb/> in which I have read the unpleasant episode&#44; pours forth a<lb/> volume of wrath against a country which thus shamelessly<lb/> goes back on her own word&#44; which takes advantage of a<lb/> renewal of inveterate bigotry&#44; to rake up old laws and rob<lb/> her subjects of rights purchased at immense sacrifices.  I<lb/> and you all naturally coincide with the writer.  We say God&#45;<lb/>speed to our brethren of whatever language and nationality&#44; who<lb/> claim the <sic>inaliableness</sic> of their acquired immunities.  And we<lb/> hope that they will not cease agitating&#44; till their efforts are crowned<lb/> with success.<lb/></p>
            <p>Still&#44; we cannot prevent a disagreeable thought from intruding<lb/> on our minds.  The rod of Divine judgment is suspended over<lb/> our heads.  Whenever we imagine to be at security&#44; and no<lb/> longer in need of leaning on God for support&#44; the rod descends<lb/> and gives us significant blows.  Yesterday in Prussia&#44; to day<lb/> in Hungary.  May we Jews of America never feel its strokes.<lb/>  I repeat &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;All that God does is for<lb/> the best.&#34;  These recent events may have taught our<lb/> Doctors who said &#34;it is all well&#34; that is not well&#44; so long<lb/></p>

            <p>as Israel forsakes his trust&#44; and postpones duty to right.<lb/>  It is a fatal error which we have imbibed from our neigh&#45;<lb/>&#45;bors to believe that we have no other cause than that of<lb/> our rights to fight for.  The cause of duty&#44; which ought<lb/> to stand preeminently in our thoughts we do not see&#44;<lb/> or we do not deem worth struggling for.  Hence Jewish<lb/> degeneracy.  Had the Maccabees shared that opinion&#44;<lb/> they would not have opposed the will of Antiochus&#44; and<lb/> our divine commission would have come to an end.  Had<lb/> our martyrs been impressed with the same idea they would<lb/> have basked in the sun&#45;shine of imperialism and left the<lb/> future to take care of itself.  But because they felt pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;foundly convinced that a solemn obligation was to be per&#45;<lb/>&#45;formed&#44; they rose equal to it and despite the thumbscrew<lb/> and the rack&#44; challenged a world to crush their spirits. compel a surrender.<lb/>  Oh if our young men and women who have the happiness to<lb/> call this their country&#44; understood how very much their<lb/> devotion to the ancestral cause will influence Israel and<lb/> indirectly the human race&#59; if they would resist&#44; more than<lb/> Felix Kronstein did&#44; the allurements which must withdraw<lb/> their offspring voluntarily or involuntarily from a mono&#45;<lb/>&#45;theistic doctrine and lead them to the fold of a popular trinitarian<lb/> creed&#33;<lb/></p>

            <p>If they would conform with the practices of Mosaism&#44;<lb/> were it even for the sake of the main principle underlying it&#44; and<lb/> which those practices support and preserve&#44; we might re&#45;<lb/>&#45;joice that here Duty and Right hold each other in a<lb/> sweet embrace&#59; Liberty and the Torah are clasped to&#45;<lb/>&#45;gether.<lb/></p>
            <p>I can only pray that we will all ponder on what we<lb/> learn&#44; and gain wisdom by experience&#59; that although we<lb/> may have had reasons in the past to lament shortcomings<lb/> and notably that which is most fatal to our interests&#44; mixed<lb/> and matrimonial alliances&#45;&#45;we shall in the future as<lb/> teachers and parents have occasion to exclaim in the<lb/> language of Isaiah &#34;We have not labored in vain&#44; nor<lb/> brought forth for trouble&#44; for these are the seed of the blessed<lb/> of the Lord&#44; and their offspring are with them.  Amen.<lb/></p>
