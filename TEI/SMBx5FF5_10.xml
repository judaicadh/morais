            <p>The Jewish Exponent.<lb/>
                PUBLISHED EVERY FRIDAY.<lb/>
                17 E. BALTIMORE ST.<lb/></p>
            <p>Baltimore&#44; Sept 14 1889.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Dr Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>I have to express sincerely my gratifi&#45;<lb/>cation at the noble course you pursued in the cloak&#45;<lb/>maker&#39;s strike&#44; it is so very different from the conduct<lb/> of so many of the rabbis who preach so much and do so<lb/> little.  In my experience I have met at least one prominent<lb/> minister who insists that his <hi rend="underline">whole</hi> teaching and the only call<lb/> for interference on his part is in the pulpit and school&#44; and I know<lb/> many others who act as if they <del>think they</del> thought the<lb/> in the same manner.  &#34;My father has always taught me to<lb/> look on the passage you shall surely rebuke your<lb/> brother that you do not bring sin in him&#34; as a triple<lb/> injunction that for evangelical work among our own co&#45;<lb/>religionists.  If however it should not be have that meaning it<lb/> certainly means that we all must take a share in cor&#45;<lb/>recting public morals <del>by seeing</del> through the individuals and not as<lb/> the rabbi above referred to who believes that the only<lb/> time he can dare endeavor to change an individual&#39;s opinion<lb/> is when he is <del>called on</del> asked by him to do so.  I would we were all in a<lb/> position to carry out the Mosaic injunction&#44; even if<lb/> we exchanged the meaning &#34;rebuke&#34; for &#34;reprove&#34;; but if<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>we the lay men can not or will not do so&#44; I certainly think<lb/> that the communal heads must represent us therein.<lb/></p>
            <p>Besides the practical carrying out of the law I referred to&#44;<lb/> which I see in your excellent work just finished&#44; I rejoice<lb/> that you have been able to do so much for suffering humanity&#44;<lb/> that a representative of traditional Judaism was able to show<lb/> the practical results of his belief on human endeavor despite<lb/> the greater protestations of &#34;liberality&#34; by those who have abjured<lb/> so many of our religion&#39;s principles.  In wishing you then<lb/> a New Year and all the good things that God vouchsafes<lb/> to his beloved&#44; I hope He may grant you a long lease<lb/> of life and many opportunities to continue your many<lb/> labors for the benefit of our religion and to bring honor to your<lb/> self and our community as well as relief by similar efforts<lb/> as those put forth in the recent strike&#59; also that you<lb/> may continue to find emulators in rabbis of your conception<lb/> of <hi rend="underline">Gimiluth Chesed</hi> as I notice you beg in to have already<lb/></p>
            <p>I also want to say that it is a great tribute to your<lb/> inspiring teachings that two of your pupils should be in&#45;<lb/>vited to come to our city to occupy a prominent pulpit in a<lb/> great occasion and that a third one &#40;Dr Adler&#41; is an or&#45;<lb/>nament to our city &#38; our community&#45;&#45;and best of all to our<lb/> religion<lb/></p>
            <p>My kindest regards &#38; compliments of the season to your<lb/> son Henry and to your family<lb/>  Yours Truly<lb/> B. H Hartogensis<lb/></p>
