            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Rabbi Johanon Ben Zacka&#239; felt disconsolate at the<lb/> death of a promising child.  Friends and disciples<lb/> called&#44; and each in his turn endeavoured to mitigate<lb/> parental grief by citing instances of severer berea&#45;<lb/>&#45;vements.  Yet&#44; the sage refused to be comforted.<lb/>  &#34;Vain&#44;&#34; said he&#44; &#34;are your efforts.&#34;  I know too well<lb/> that many have suffered losses possibly greater<lb/> than that which weighs me down&#44; but that sad<lb/> fact does not lessen the keenness of my own sor&#45;<lb/>&#45;row&#34;.  At that a young scholar arose and spoke<lb/> thus.  &#34;Revered teacher&#44; the thought that your child<lb/> was returned to God spotless&#44; ought to be a source of<lb/> profound consolation.&#39;  &#34;Yes&#44;&#34; exclaimed Rabbi Johanon.<lb/>  &#34;That is indeed a comfort.&#34;  I&#44; my sympathising<lb/> hearers&#44; so instructed&#44; will not attempt by to assuage<lb/> by futile means the pain of those who lament the<lb/> departure of this God&#39;s creature.  I shall not say<lb/> that yesterday when I learnt of the demise of<lb/> B. N. I had just come back from burying a<lb/> child upon whom his distressed parents had doted.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I shall not add that on my way homeward<lb/> I stopped to visit a mother&#44; who only a few<lb/> weeks ago had escaped from that fiery furnace&#45;&#45;from<lb/> Russia&#45;&#45;a mother who was maddened at the sight of<lb/> her child crushed in one of our thoroughfares under the wheels<lb/> of a public conveyance.  My narrative would<lb/> excite pity&#44; and elicit tears&#44; but it could not allay<lb/> distress.  I therefore&#44; though the last among<lb/> the pupils of Israel&#39;s Sages&#44; will say&#44; like the scholar<lb/> of old&#58; &#34;The thought that this dear girl went to her<lb/> Maker undefiled should prove a veritable consolation.<lb/>  Young she was and fair.  Aye&#58; in the spring of<lb/> life and very comely.  But how numerous the se&#45;<lb/>&#45;ductions which may have surrounded her by reason of<lb/> that&#59; how many the temptations lying in ambush<lb/> to draw her into the meshes of vice and sin&#33;  That<lb/> she shunned them&#44; and presented herself to the Almighty<lb/> clothed in virginal purity is to those who loved<lb/> her a lasting comfort.  It would be<lb/> unnatural not to bemoan a loss so very premature&#44;<lb/> the demise of one whose golden dreams may have<lb/> pictured a future replete with terrestrial joys&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>as a maiden&#44; or perchance as a wedded wife&#44; or<lb/> mother.  We that have passed the years of maturity&#44;<lb/> but who can recall the buoyancy of by gone days<lb/> will understand the schemes which fancy builds up<lb/> to the delight of youth.  That all anticipations are glowing hopes<lb/> should have been dashed against the stones of an unti&#45;<lb/>&#45;mely grave is distressing&#44; but only to us&#44; finite beings<lb/> who judge outwardly&#44; and whose mental vision cannot<lb/> stretch beyond a space.  To her who is know impara&#45;<lb/>&#45;dised in purity&#44; what we deplore has ceased to offer<lb/> any attraction.  She is lifted higher in the contem&#45; fruition<lb/>&#45;plations of unfading glories.  The knowledge<lb/> that she clung to virtue&#44; that with her last breath<lb/> she confessed the existence and omnipotence of the<lb/> One Eternal Lord&#44; that in His hand she trustingly<lb/> committed her soul&#44; those remembrances are an eden<lb/> of beatitude.  Oh may she from her celestial abode<lb/> speak to the living words of a blessed imparting.<lb/>  May she breathe into the hearts of her survivors peace<lb/> and piety&#44; forgiveness and forbearance&#44; sentiments which<lb/> may raise them and their posterity in the sight of<lb/> God and in the estimation of all the good and true.<lb/></p>
