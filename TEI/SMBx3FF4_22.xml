            <p>My dear friend.&#95;&#95;After a long lapse of time I again<lb/> resume my pen to indite you a few lines&#44; if my seeming negligence in<lb/> writing should cause you to feel in any wise slighted&#44; I hope you will<lb/> dispel any such idea&#59; no doubt you are aware that I have been a<lb/> victim to nervous dyspepsia&#44; that at times I have not been able to make<lb/> a legible letter&#44; and hence discarded writing any thing but postal cards&#44;<lb/> thanks to almighty God&#44; for the past couple of weeks I feel much impro<lb/>ved and will now endeavour to write a few lines to my old friends.<lb/>  I hope my esteemed friend that this effort will tend to show you that<lb/> you are not forgotten&#44; though seemingly neglected&#44; and trust that you&#44;<lb/> dear Nina&#91;&#63;&#93; and all the dear children are in health.  I often hear from<lb/> you through my dear sister&#44; and have taken great pleasure reading the<lb/> various articles in the Jewish Journals emanating from your pen.  I<lb/> note that your synagogue is undergoing a renovation&#44; and I know how<lb/> anxiously you are looking forward for its completion.  I hope it will<lb/> be the means of inducing the members to take a lively interest in<lb/> congregational affairs&#44; and that the &#34;Mickvae Israel&#34; may rank foremost<lb/> as in days of yore&#44; it is my old congregation and shall always cherish<lb/> with fond <sic>reccollections</sic> the many pleasant sabbaths and festivals I enjoyed<lb/></p>

            <p>within the portals of its synagogues.  I say synagogues&#44; from the fact that<lb/> the present building is the third at which I have at times <sic>worshipped</sic>&#44;<lb/> but few are now remaining that can make the assertion&#44; alas&#33; they<lb/> are numbered among the dead&#44; and their spirits are now hovering<lb/> in your midst.  I fully <sic>reccollect</sic> a few years ago when at<lb/> your synagogue on Kipur day but a few were then remaining&#59;<lb/> morning and evening I fervently thank my God that He has thus<lb/> spared me&#44; and look to Him for a continuance of His blessings&#58; in<lb/> this connection I must tender you my thanks for the translation of the<lb/> ode written in Hebrew by our friend Rubenstein&#44; I had it set in <del>type</del><lb/> type some time ago&#44; and a proof sent to me whilst I was away<lb/> at Richmond&#44; and showed it to Rev Mr Harvis&#44; he thought that it<lb/> might be put in rhyme&#44; and left it with him&#44; he sent me a <hi rend="underline">poetical</hi><lb/> <sic>effussion</sic> in English&#44; but I do not like it as well&#44; as your <hi rend="underline">pure</hi> <del>trans</del><lb/> translation&#44; by the by&#44; whilst I was absent from city the English<lb/> matter all went to pi and <del>disbuted</del> the type distributed&#44; but I<lb/> send you however the proof of your translation&#44; that you may<lb/> read it and make whatever corrections in punctuation or typo<lb/>graphy it may need.  Please vary the translation a little in order<lb/> that the lines marked &#43; may be arranged&#44; so that the matter<lb/></p>
                
            <p>in each of those lines may be embraced in one line instead of running<lb/> into two lines&#44; so that I can have four lines in each stanza&#44; and place<lb/> it in the same space and in line with the Hebrew&#44; it is my intention<lb/> to have a neater heading&#44; and a neat border put <sic>arround</sic> the whole&#44;<lb/> printed in gold bronze and fra to be framed&#44; that I may distribute<lb/> them among my dear children&#45;&#45;grand children&#45;&#45;sisters&#45;&#45;and any of<lb/> my friends that may desire a copy&#45;&#45;I must have all the English<lb/> re&#45;set in type&#44; the Hebrew is Electrotyped.  I know you would be<lb/> agreeably surprised to see how Mr Rubenstein has improved in personal<lb/> appearance&#44; his English dialect has improved and lectures well&#44; his<lb/> compositions are excellent.  With much love from our dear ones&#59; I<lb/> am as Ever.  Yours very truly Jacob Ezekiel<lb/></p>
