            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>a funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>Over this funeral pall a venerable figure bends.  Sorrow is<lb/> depicted in its lineaments.  Behold the olden religion wailing<lb/> the loss of a faithful disciple&#33;  Children of Hannah<lb/> Florance&#33;  you can assuage the grief felt by your<lb/> mother&#39;s revered belief.  I pray with sincerity that your<lb/> adherence thereto&#44; may not demand the weighty sacrifices<lb/> this righteous woman voluntarily made.  But you should<lb/> treasure up her example.  You&#44; her descendants&#44; should<lb/> perpetuate the principles she nobly maintained&#59; honor our<lb/> faith by acknowledging it as your supreme guide.<lb/>  It was thus that the estimable being now enshrouded from<lb/> our vision&#44; earned the gratitude of the Hebrew community<lb/> and&#44; as I believe&#44; the love of the Creator.  In the struggle<lb/> between duty and natural cravings or affections&#44; the contest<lb/> did not long remain indecisive.  The former bore always<lb/> the palm.  Surrounded by allurements&#44; to which many<lb/> complacently <sic>yeilded</sic>&#44; she proved constant to her people<lb/> and her God.  Could I draw but a few of the salient<lb/> traits in the character of the departed&#44; I would elicit<lb/> from my hearers this confession.  Judaism is the<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>parent of virtue.  Its votaries rise through it above<lb/> the severest trials of life.  By its means they are spiritualized.<lb/>  But I forbear&#44; lest my words sound like flattery.  For&#44; she<lb/> whom we lament&#44; enjoyed wealth&#45;&#45;the main&#45;spring of<lb/> fulsome adulation.  Yet&#44; to continue altogether silent<lb/> would be equally unbecoming&#44; as to be guilty of sycophancy.<lb/>  Human praise cannot reach her&#44; whom angels greet to the<lb/> abode of bliss.  But the living&#44; they that are left to cope<lb/> with the passions&#44; she so nobly overcame&#44; they must&#44;<lb/> partially at least&#45;&#45;be shown the lesson taught by this<lb/> sainted Jewess.  The more needful is that imparting&#44;<lb/> because many of the rich wantonly cast off the health&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful yoke imposed by Israel&#39;s creed&#59; and others&#45;&#45;less favorably situated&#45;&#45;aping their<lb/> doings&#44; affect contempt for our divine behests.<lb/></p>
            <p>Hannah Florance never presumed to set her final position at<lb/> war with the Law of Sinai.  No&#58; she improved the<lb/> occasion which enabled her to carry its standard aloft.<lb/>  What she prized above temporal advantages&#44; she would<lb/> render honorable by her personal exertions.  Hence did her name ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pear conspicuously among the women of Israel&#44; who secure<lb/> for their religion general commendation&#44; by seeking out in&#45;<lb/>&#45;digence&#44; and relieving its woes&#44; by educating the untutored&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>by lessening the evils of ignorance and pauperism.  Hence she also<lb/> contributed largely to the support of Divine worship&#44; and early<lb/> joined it in a devout attitude.  Hence she hallowed the<lb/> Sabbath&#44; and&#44; as the humblest of her brethren&#44; kept the precepts of<lb/> Holy Writ.  And if at times&#44; circumstances beyond her control<lb/> precluded her conforming entirely to the dictum of revelation &#38;<lb/> tradition&#44; she bore the satisfaction of having endeavoured to do<lb/> all her duty.  What comfort did she not derive from that<lb/> consciousness of her good intentions&#33;  A downy fellow<lb/> it was to her aching heart.  The world might hesitate to<lb/> award the merit due to her religious fidelity.  The world<lb/> might even misjudge.  She rested upon the consolatory<lb/> belief in an all&#45;seeing God.  He had searched her and<lb/> found her pure.  Death had therefore no terror for her<lb/> soul.  It <sic>envelopped</sic> from her mortal ken objects<lb/> tenderly loved&#44; but it opened to her spiritual view the Essence<lb/> of love&#44; the full radiance of that sun of righteousness which never sets.<lb/>  The delights of eternity&#44; the rejoicing among the blessed<lb/> at her arrival.  Let no tear be shed over these peri&#45;<lb/>&#45;shable remains.  The spirit that dwelt thereon lives&#44; and bids<lb/> all who loved and respected Hannah Florance to copy her stead&#45;<lb/>&#45;fastness in the path of truth&#44; her piety&#44; her sublime virtues.<lb/></p>
