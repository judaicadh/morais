            <p>For Cakat about a Bar Mitzvah<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Those who have paid attention to the portion of<lb/> the Pentateuch read by our Bar Mitzvah lad&#44; must<lb/> have remarked a singular expression.  Its peculiarity<lb/> is the more noticeable&#44; because it emanated from one<lb/> whom the scriptures represent as the meekest of men.<lb/>  Moses&#44; who&#44; during many years&#44; had borne with the<lb/> people under the severest provocations&#44; on approa&#45;<lb/>&#45;ching the end of his career suddenly gave vent to<lb/> a burst of anger.  Why&#63;  It was not the first ac&#45;<lb/>&#45;cusation&#44; that he had <sic>wilfully</sic> led Israel to destruct&#45;<lb/>&#45;ion.  Whenever the fear of water famine specially<lb/> troubled the mind of multitudes&#44; the cruel charge was<lb/> repeated.  But cruelty grows in intensity&#44; in<lb/> proportion as it betrays ingratitude for services re&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceived&#59; a want of feelings for age and for virtue.<lb/>  The psalmist understood it well&#44; when he wrote<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;they occasioned indignation in the waters of Merebah&#44; and<lb/> it went ill with Moses for their sake&#44; because they<lb/> angered his spirit&#44; and he spoke inadvisedly with<lb/> his lips&#34;.  The imputation did wound to the<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>core&#59; the threatening looks which sought<lb/> to intimidate&#44; and which made the face lower down<lb/> in sorrow&#44; were offensive.  But he that works for<lb/> God&#44; must learn never to flinch&#59; let him stand<lb/> contumely and bow to reproach.  It is a painful<lb/> duty&#44; still it is his duty.  Words full<lb/> of wrath were those of Moses.  &#34;Hear now ye rebels&#44;<lb/> must we fetch you water out of this well&#63;&#34;  It was<lb/> not the Divine message he delivered.  &#34;See&#44;&#34; he<lb/> should have said&#58; &#34;See how nature responds to the will<lb/> of her Maker.  I bid yonder rock&#44; in the name of<lb/> God&#44; to quench your thirst&#44; and water will flow<lb/> in abundance.  Lose not your faith in the Omnipotent.&#34;<lb/>  But the message was forgotten&#44; while listening to<lb/> a sense of resentment.  The anguish which<lb/> the punishment decreed on high brought to Moses&#44;<lb/> is mirrored in his soul touching supplication&#44; recorded<lb/> in Deuteronomy.  &#34;O Lord God&#44; Thou hast begun to show<lb/> Thy servant Thy greatness and Thy mighty hand.......<lb/>  Let me go over&#44; I pray Thee&#44; and behold the good land<lb/> which is beyond the Jordan&#44; that goodly mountain<lb/> and the Lebanon.&#34;  But Israel&#39;s God is not<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>a respecter of persons&#44; nay&#59; from the most<lb/> righteous&#44; He requires the most unswerving obedience.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            <p>You&#44; my young brother&#44; have reminded us of this truth.<lb/>  Take it therefore to heart&#44; and begin at once to act<lb/> accordingly.  Gather in virtues as you proceed in<lb/> life&#59; such virtues as will distinguish you at home<lb/> for a reverential demeanour to parents&#59; in school<lb/> for a diligence dictated by a strong love for labor.<lb/>  I was glad to read that a growing ingenuity has<lb/> facilitated your admission into an institution for ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;nual training.  That disposition is the voice of<lb/> your Creator.  It tells you that to handle the chi&#45;<lb/>&#45;sel and the hammer accords with your nature.<lb/>  Let not a feeling of false pride intrude and insinuate<lb/> that the counting&#45;house or the professional office<lb/> is nobler than the work shop.  Every day&#39;s re&#45;<lb/>velations caution youths against vocations for which<lb/> they are not fitted&#44; and strongly are they warned<lb/> against the temptations of speculative commerce.<lb/>  Labor may not hold out the seductive promises<lb/> of quickly&#45;gained riches&#44; but it will always<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>ensure the <sic>skilful</sic> and the assiduous a decent livelihood.<lb/>  Besides&#44; we owe it to our religion to remove from it<lb/> the stigma that those who profess it add nothing<lb/> to the arts&#44; whose cultivation has made America<lb/> deservedly famous.  I wish that some of my brethren<lb/> become noted for their inventive genius in mechanism.<lb/>  Their rising will be our honor&#44; so long as their actions will<lb/> illustrate their descent.  I would neglect what<lb/> the occasion imperatively demands&#44; were I not to empha&#45;<lb/>&#45;size this point.  You will shed lustre upon our people&#44;<lb/> while you remain with us and follow virtue&#44; but the<lb/> moment you depart from our midst&#44; your very attain&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments will be thorns in our sides.  Be true to us&#44;<lb/> and we shall boast of your achievements.  Remember this<lb/> day on which you have taught us that God is not a<lb/> respecter of persons&#44; and let the future which you<lb/> will lay out for yourself&#44; benefit the living&#44; glorify<lb/> the dead&#44; and exemplify the principle that you have<lb/> enunciated.  The Law of Sinai is the Law of<lb/> Truth&#44; within which a life of eternity is implanted.<lb/>  May such be your reward.  Amen.<lb/></p>
