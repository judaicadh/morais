                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>It would be obviously absurd&#44; even false to say assume that because<lb/> I regret the departure from old established usages&#44; from a Hebrew usage of their immemorial which<lb/> the disposition of this body will first make&#44; in my the course of from so<lb/> ministration&#44; Hebrew from a usage of time immemorial&#44; therefore I stand here not in an official<lb/> capacity&#44; but simply in the character of personal<lb/> friend.  I could never understand how an individual<lb/> might separate himself from himself.  Fiction may<lb/> so picture us&#44; reality proves that attempt&#44; lying and ludicrous.<lb/>  No&#44; the Morais who preaches on a Jewish pulpit&#44; and<lb/> urges the observance of time honored old established universally accepted practices in Israel&#44; is the Morais<lb/> who speaks over these mortal remains.  Still&#44; it is very<lb/> true that the few words which will be uttered on<lb/> this occasion&#44; flow spontaneously from a heart warm<lb/> with friendship.  All know that J. E. did<lb/> not share my views&#44; touching regarding the ceremonial precepts<lb/> to which I am attached&#44; and which I deem my<lb/> bounden duty to enforce&#59; but ought I then to sup&#45;<lb/>&#45;press my feelings sentiments&#44; and withhold from an admirable<lb/> friend&#44; the acknowledgment of the2 qualities of the mind<lb/> and the1 high virtues which adorned her womanhood&#63;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For she was intelligent&#44; and the mental gifts she pos&#45; at her<lb/> &#45;sessed command were not a trees in a wilderness&#44; whose fruits<lb/> none can enjoy.  She readily let others partake<lb/> thereof. them  Early in life she became a teacher&#44;<lb/> conscientiously laboring and drawing towards<lb/> herself the enduring affection of her pupils.<lb/>  Who among the latter fonder of J E than my<lb/> oldest child&#44; whose grief will be very deep<lb/> on hearing of the sudden death of her friend and confident&#63;<lb/>  Bright How congenial in moral principles those two beings&#33;  For&#44; bright without pretension the deceased was&#59;<lb/> well read without pedantry&#59; buoyant in feelings&#44;<lb/> gladdening by her presence young and old.<lb/>  Such were in brief&#44; were the powers which she beauti&#45;<lb/>&#45;fully exercised.  But what endeared<lb/> Miss E. to me and mine chiefly is was the evidence of her<lb/> generous nature.  If those who own riches&#44;<lb/> possessed but a light portion of her all&#45;em&#45;<lb/>&#45;bracing humanity&#44; how greatly would misery<lb/> be alleviated&#33;  We often hear it said&#44; that<lb/> a person is liberal to a fault.  I cannot<lb/> reckon my friend&#39;s charity a sin&#44; but she did let her<lb/> kindly instincts overcome the thought of self&#44; to a<lb/></p> 
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>degree which many would consider too excessive.<lb/>  Upon my dear ones and myself she bestowed<lb/> frequent tokens of attachment&#44; whose memory<lb/> will long abide in our midst&#59; &#38; that is the me&#45;<lb/>&#45;morial which I now lay as a wreath of grati&#45;<lb/>&#45;tude upon over this coffin.  But my<lb/> knowledge of my friend goes back to the days<lb/> of her girlhood&#44; when&#44; unitedly jointly with her sisters&#44; she<lb/> worked for her mother&#39;s welfare.  I recall now the days time<lb/> when that mother needed her attendance ministration most to smooth<lb/> her aching pillow&#44; because her married daughters could<lb/> not be ready at hand in the hour of sickness.<lb/>  I can testify to a filial devotion&#44; which&#44; though<lb/> by no means lacking in the rest of Mrs Bertha<lb/> E.&#39;s offspring&#44; was demonstrably shown by our<lb/> J. unremittingly.  I forbear allusions<lb/> to that hopeful love connection of later years&#44; destined to remain an ungratified aspiration.<lb/>  Why shall I intensify sorrow&#63;  Alas&#33;  &#34;The<lb/> silver cord is loose&#44; the golden bowl is crushed&#44;<lb/> and dust will return to the earth as it was.&#34;<lb/>  But can will virtues go unrecompensed&#63;  Will the<lb/> intellect illumined by a light from above<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>become extinguished&#63;&#44;&#45;&#45;the soul which con&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceived goodness and impelled prompted the hand to<lb/> perform  it&#44; wither away and be lost&#63;  Never&#44; as<lb/> there can never be injustice in the Almighty<lb/> Creator...Go to thy reward&#44; our sister&#44;<lb/> our friend.  Mayest thou live in a<lb/> loftier and purer sphere.  May the<lb/> forgiving Lord&#44; pardon thy trespasses&#44; and<lb/> because of the nobility of thy nature&#44; assign allot<lb/> to thee a bliss unalloyed and everlasting.<lb/></p>
