            <p>Eastern Penitentiary. Oct 8. 1878.<lb/></p>
            <p>Most Reverend Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>Severe sickness com&#45;<lb/>pels me as a last resort to address you.<lb/>  Please forgive me if I am taking an<lb/> unwarranted liberty in doing so&#44; for<lb/> I know no other alternative.  As I<lb/> write these lines&#44; I am confined to a<lb/> bed of sickness where I have lain<lb/> for nine long weeks with hemorrhage&#44;<lb/> and I feel but little hope of recovery.<lb/>  Although deeply dyed in sin&#44; an<lb/> outcast and a convict&#44; I do not hesi&#45;<lb/>tate in addressing you thus openly&#44;<lb/> for I feel in my heart that I am<lb/> writing to a fellow&#45;brother who will<lb/> not spurn me&#44; nor reject my petition<lb/> with reproach.  I am here on the charge of<lb/> forgery&#44; and am guilty.  I will not try<lb/> to solicit your sympathy by falsehood in<lb/> saying otherwise&#59; nor will I attempt to<lb/> mitigate my offense by the plea of my<lb/> age&#44; for though I am but 22 years of age&#44;<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>I am as guilty as if I were older.  But I<lb/> have been very unfortunate.  Ever since the<lb/> day when I lost a <hi rend="underline">dear</hi> mother&#44; who was<lb/> the world to us&#44; (peace to her ashes&#41;&#44; my life<lb/> has been one continual strife of temptation.<lb/>  Here&#44; surrounded by prison&#45;bars on all sides<lb/> of me&#44; where Solitude&#44; Remembrance&#44; and<lb/> Longing are my only companions&#44; I often lie &#38;<lb/> think midst tears of sorrow&#44; how different my<lb/> life would have been had my mother lived.<lb/>  I have no one in this wide world who cares<lb/> for me&#44; except my aged father&#44; and I would<lb/> heartily end my days in prison rather than<lb/> let him know of my disgrace.  He is nearly<lb/> 70 years of age now&#44; and would never outlive<lb/> the tidings of it&#59; and with all my sinful<lb/> nature I have enough feeling of heart left<lb/> to spare the only one whom God has spared<lb/> me.  Several of those interested in my welfare<lb/> here have advised me that my only hopes lie<lb/> in a pardon.  The disease under which I suffer<lb/> is one which can never be <hi rend="underline">effectually</hi> cured&#44; and<lb/> the flow of blood is attended with <sic>symptons</sic><lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>of consumption.  The officials here are kind<lb/> to me&#44; and the physician is doing everything in<lb/> his power to help me.  But solitary confinement&#44;<lb/> living day after day in the same lonely cage&#44;<lb/> never breathing the gift of God&#39;s pure air from<lb/> morn till eve&#44; is doing its work.  It is the<lb/> nature of every man to love life&#44; and what<lb/> makes me cling to it more than ever now&#44; is<lb/> my eager longing to redeem myself before<lb/> God and man ere I am summoned to His<lb/> High Tribunal beladen with sin and shame<lb/> as I am now.  Were it possible for you to<lb/> penetrate into the hidden sorrow that lies<lb/> buried in this miserable heart of mine&#44; to<lb/> know my yearning desire to live a better<lb/> life&#44; I am sure you would sympathize with<lb/> me.  I know that every member of a<lb/> Jewish family is moved by a noble spirit of<lb/> benevolence to help an erring brother&#44; and&#44;<lb/> if possible save him from a downfall of<lb/> misery or disgrace.  I appeal to you&#44; therefore&#44;<lb/> in the name of a fellow&#45;brother&#44; to try to<lb/> assist me from this tomb of suffering&#44;<lb/> and give me one earthly chance to redeem<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>my health and name.  The cost attending<lb/> an application of pardon is not much.<lb/>  The lawyer&#39;s fee would likewise be a<lb/> moderate one.  Do not think I expect this<lb/> assistance from you&#44; reverend Sir.&#45;&#45;but I<lb/> feel that among your congregation there<lb/> are hearts that would nobly sympathize<lb/> with me if they knew my condition.  With<lb/> all the reverence and sincerity due you&#44; the<lb/> holy teacher and Rabbi of our faith&#44; I<lb/> implore your efforts in my behalf.  If I<lb/> am pronounced unworthy the sympathy<lb/> of honest men&#44; then I shall rest content<lb/> to bear my doom in silence with the<lb/> penalty of that Fate that brought me<lb/> here&#44; and which seems to pursue me so<lb/> pitilessly to the end.<lb/></p>
            <p>Your humble brother<lb/>
                in misfortune<lb/>
