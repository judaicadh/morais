                from S. Mendelsohn<lb/>
                Wilmington&#44; N. C.<lb/></p>
            <p>Rev. &#38; dear sir&#58;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; I beg leave to submit for your consideration &#38; decision the<lb/> following question&#58; <hi rend="underline">Is the holding of funeral services in the synagogue<lb/> opposed to the spirit of our laws &#38; desecrating the house of God</hi>&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>This question is&#44; with me&#44; not an idle one&#58; it is a &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> which I seek.  For even now there is pending in my congregation a resolu<lb/>tion authorizing the opening of the synagogue for funeral services&#44; in<lb/> case it be the desire of the bereaved family&#45;&#45;members of the Jewish commu&#45;<lb/>nity&#44; of course&#45;&#45;to hold such services in the synagogue.<lb/></p>
            <p>Now&#44; while I full well know that&#44; to hold funeral services over<lb/> the remains of a layman in the synagogue is not a general custom in Israel<lb/>&#45;&#45;though in Europe I have seen it done &#38; in this country I have heard of it&#44;&#45;&#45;<lb/> &#38; while I duly appreciate the gravity of our sages&#39; maxims&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#38;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; therefore do not lightly esteem our customs&#58; I am neverthe&#45;<lb/>less inclined to sanciton the proposed innovation&#44; not&#44; however&#44; for the sake<lb/> of the innovation&#44; but for the sake of the wholesome results that may follow.<lb/>  I conscientiously believe that the opening of the house dedicated to the wor&#45;<lb/>ship of God &#38; to instruction in the word of God for the purpose under consider&#45;<lb/>ation&#44; will accomplish in Israel more good than many eloquent sermons<lb/> preached to empty benches&#59; &#38; if &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Berakhoth IX &#167;5; Yer. ib.<lb/> IX &#167;8&#45;b.14<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Tot&#44; et al.&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93; that&#44; under similar circumstances&#44; a &#91;Hebrew&#93; mi&#91;ght&#93;<lb/></p>

            <p>What is it that leads people to believe the holding of funeral services in the<lb/> synagogue opposed to the spirit of our laws&#63;  The Bible is silent on the question&#44;<lb/> &#38; &#91;Hebrew&#93; it can not be included&#44; because while Christianity was yet in its<lb/> earliest infancy&#44; public funerals &#91;Hebrew&#93; among the Jews were held in sy&#45;<lb/>nagogues &#40;of Megillah 28<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41;.&#95;The Mishnah &#40;ib. III &#167; 3&#41; says&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;;<lb/> but as our synagogues are &#91;Hebrew&#93; in splendid condition&#44; this can not be applied<lb/> to them.  We consult the Tosefta&#44; &#38; here &#40;ib. II&#44; ed. Zuck. III&#44; end&#41; we read as follows&#58;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; which the Gemarah &#40;ib. 28<hi rend="sup">a</hi> sq.&#41;&#44;<lb/> probably on the principle of &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#38; <hi rend="underline">vice versa</hi> &#40;&#63;&#41;&#44; reproduces in this form&#58;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; xxx &#91;Hebrew&#93; xxx &#91;Hebrew&#93;.

Tefillah XI &#167; 7&#41;.<lb/>  The author of the &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;151 &#167;1&#41; states it in about the same language&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; commenting upon which<lb/> the &#91;Hebrew&#93; remarks&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; which view the author of the &#91;Hebrew&#93; himself expresses in his &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#40;344 &#167;19&#41;&#44; where he says&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.&#45;&#45;This&#44; then&#44; is<lb/> the &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; to my limited knowledge the only one <sic>germain</sic> to the question at issue&#59;<lb/> but &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; I venture to contend that this Halakhah does not prohibit the<lb/></p>

            <p>holding of <hi rend="underline">funeral services</hi> in the synagogue&#44; &#38; that&#44; per contra&#44; according to<lb/> the spirit &#38; even to the letter of this Halakhah&#44; funeral services ought to be held<lb/> in the house dedicated to the worship of God &#38; to instruction in the word of God.<lb/></p>
            <p>Remembering that the Talmudic term &#91;Hebrew&#93; is multivocal &#40;cf. Jastrow&#44; Dick&#44; s. v.&#41;&#44; one might<lb/> easily be led to suppose that it implies also funeral <hi rend="underline">services</hi>&#59; &#38; yet such is not the<lb/> case.  The fact is&#44; as far as we know&#44; under the Talmudic dispensation there were no<lb/> services at the funerals.  There were the funeral <hi rend="underline">ceremonies</hi>&#44; <hi rend="underline">obsequies</hi>&#44; conducted with<lb/> great pomp &#38; grandeur.  These embraced vocal &#38; instrumental music&#44; hired mour&#45;<lb/>ners &#38; torch bearers&#44; elegies &#38; eulogies&#44; wringing of hands&#44; smiting on the breast&#44;<lb/> stamping with the foot &#40;Moed Katon 24 sq.; Kethuboth 46<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#44; 48<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#59; Semahoth&#44; et al.&#41;;<lb/> but nowhere do we find in the Talmud the slightest reference to funeral services.<lb/>  We do meet with the &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;ab. Zarah 18<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#59; anp. Sifre Debarin &#167;307&#41;; but even<lb/> that was said&#44; not during the funeral ceremonies&#44; but by the dying &#38; not by all<lb/> the dying&#44; as is evident from the Rabbi&#39;s <sic>exclammation</sic>&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#33;&#45;&#45;That such a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; embracing such displays<lb/> was distasteful to our sages&#44; appears from its being mentioned in connection with<lb/> acts denominated &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Meg. l. c.&#41;.  The were gorgeous ceremonies&#44; often continued<lb/> for many days &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#45;&#45;M. Katon 27<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#44; et al.&#41; &#38; ruinous to bereaved families&#44;<lb/> so that &#34;the disposal of the remains was frequently more distressing than the<lb/> death itself&#34; &#40;ib. 27<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41;&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;&#45;&#45;hence could not be coun<lb/>tenanced in the synagogue&#44; where all classes of people gather to pour out their<lb/> spirits to God or to learn the word of God.  These spectacular obsequies too much<lb/> glorified the high &#38; mortified the low&#44; so that the latter frequently deserted their dying<lb/></p>

            <p>in order to escape the humiliation consequent upon their inability to rival their<lb/> affluent brethren in <sic>funerial</sic> displays &#40;ib.&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;&#45;&#45;hence<lb/> the sages&#39; objection to lending the synagogue for private funeral ceremonies.<lb/></p>
            <p>Our funerals have nothing in common with those of olden days&#44;<lb/> save what is consoling &#38; edifying.  Modern Jewish funerals are not at&#45;<lb/>tended by gorgeous <sic>pageantries</sic> &#38; costly exhibitions&#44; but by sorrowing friends<lb/> &#38; subdued mourninf&#59; they are accompanied&#44; not by wringing of hands &#38; smit&#45;<lb/>ing the breast&#44; but by solemn services &#38;instructive lessons&#44;&#45;&#45;hence they can<lb/> not fall under the fan of proscription.&#95;Indeed&#44; it seems to me that the spi&#45;<lb/>rit&#44; &#38; even the letter of the Halakhah under consideration recommend the<lb/> holding of funerals&#44; as conducted nowadays&#44; in the synagogue.  The Tosefta&#44;<lb/> &#38; the Gemara&#44; &#38; the casuists tell us&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; I hazard<lb/> nothing in asserting that&#44; in our days&#44; there is no other &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The &#91;Hebrew&#93; of<lb/> the Talmud is&#44; according to glossaries &#38; casuists&#44; one at which &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> a great many people are present.  Another Halakhah makes it obligatory<lb/> on the community at large to attend the funeral of a well known person&#58;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Moed Katon 24<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#59; Maimon&#44; H. Abel XII &#167;11; Yore Deah 353 &#167;5&#41;;<lb/> &#38; since in our days almost every Israelite is blest with large circles of<lb/> acquaintances&#44; particularly among those who worship with him in the<lb/> same synagogue&#44; every funeral is a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; consequently ought to take place<lb/> in the synagogue.<lb/></p>
            <p>That in our days every funeral is a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; one which is attended<lb/> by many people&#44; goes without saying.  Every Israelite from whose house a funeral<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>ever took place knows that&#44; notwithstanding his having prepared for the sad<lb/> occasion the largest room in the house &#38; furnished it with his neighbors&#39;<lb/> chairs&#44; there were not seats enough&#44; or even standing room enough&#44; for the<lb/> people that crowded in&#59; &#38; every one who ever attended a Jewish funeral from<lb/> private premises knows that&#44; while the minister conducts the funeral services<lb/> in the house of mourning&#44; there are vastly more people in front of that house<lb/> than under its roof&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>And do we owe nothing to public convenience &#38; to public health&#63;<lb/>  Have we never heard of people contracting colds &#38; more serious ailments<lb/> from exposure at funerals&#63;&#95; Our sages extol public respect&#44; going so far<lb/> as to say&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Berakhoth 19<hi rend="sup">b</hi><lb/> Meg. 3<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#59; cf. Tosafoth ib. s. v. 37<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41;&#44;<lb/> &#38; we&#44; without express authority for it&#44; close the synagogue against the public<lb/> attending funerals&#33;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#33;&#95;I know that&#44; pointing to the Halakhah&#44; where<lb/> it says&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; one might argue that&#44; as the same treatise which<lb/> contains our sages exalted opinion of &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; contains also this prohibition&#44;<lb/> whence it might be inferred that&#44; in this respect&#44; our ancients did not consider<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; of insuperable importance&#44; for &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Berakhoth lc.&#41;&#33;  My re&#45;<lb/>ply would be Far from it&#33;  Public respect was with our sages an inviolable<lb/> rule&#59; but in the case of a strictly private funeral&#44; their apparent devia&#45;<lb/>tion from that rule was dictated&#44; first&#44; by their respect for the greater public<lb/> combined with their objections to the obsequies themselves&#59; &#38; 2<hi rend="sup">ndly</hi>&#44; by the fact that<lb/> there was no occasion to disturb the synagogue on account of every private<lb/> funeral&#44; families having then owned private &#34;mourning&#45;houses&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>

We have no such mourning&#45;houses &#38; no such obsequies&#59; but we have<lb/> synagogues&#44; whither the Israelite does&#44; or is expected to&#44; hie himself on every<lb/> occasion&#59; these synagogues are commodious edifices&#44;&#45;&#45;why not open them<lb/> for the convenience of the sorely tired mourners &#38; of their large circle of sym&#45;<lb/>pathizing friends&#63;  The Tosefta&#44; &#38; the Gemara&#44; &#38; the casuists&#44; as we have seen&#44;<lb/> agree in recommending the opening of the synagogue for a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; the<lb/> &#34;Prince of Commentators&#44;&#34; Rashi remarks&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Meg. 28<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#44; s.<lb/> v. &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;&#44; which means public convenience&#44;&#45;&#45;let us adopt the recommendation&#44;<lb/> if only &#91;Hebrew&#93; for the sake of public convenience.<lb/></p>
            <p>But it is not merely convenience&#44; private or public&#44; that inclines me to<lb/> sanction the proposed quasi innovation&#59; I am actuated by a higher motive&#44; even<lb/> the good effects which the better facilities for holding funeral services will produce.<lb/></p>
            <p>Some years ago&#44; I had the honor of an invitation to read before the Jewish<lb/> Ministers&#39; Association a paper on &#34;Funeral Orations&#44;&#34; &#38; in the course of my remarks<lb/> on that subject&#44; I expressed the following views&#58;&#45;&#45;In our days&#44; &#38; particularly in this<lb/> country&#44; &#34;while the funeral address is confessedly not an indispensable component<lb/> of the burial services&#44; it is the almost universal custom&#44; &#38; objectively very im&#45;<lb/>portant&#44; because of the possible consequences in that &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Moed<lb/> Katon 28<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#44; et al&#41;.  Funeral services are often attended even by such as are hardly&#44;<lb/> if ever&#44; seen in the synagogue&#44; &#38; the minister has thus a rare opportunity for<lb/> approaching hearts which are usually far removed from his influence&#59; &#38; who<lb/> can tell whether the good seed sown on so solemn an occasion&#44; may not find<lb/></p>

            <p>Such views I have embodied in my paper&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; when I laid them before the said Association&#42;&#44; they received the<lb/> unqualified endorsement of that learned body&#44;&#45;&#45;hence I believe that the fu&#45;<lb/>neral address is entitled to a place in the Jewish pulpit as much as any other<lb/> address based on Jewish lore &#38; Jewish doctrine&#44; &#38; more so than the wedding<lb/> ceremony &#40;emp. &#91;Hebrew&#93; in Y.

For after all&#44;<lb/> if the &#92; term &#91;Hebrew&#93; in our Halakhah means anything&#44; it certainly means the<lb/> funeral address&#59; &#38; from the language of the Tosefta &#40;Kethub.

            <p>the funeral ceremonies have from time to time been introduced &#40;ib. 27&#41;.  Again&#44;<lb/> as long as the &#91;Hebrew&#93; was purely subjective&#44; confined to the delineation of the<lb/> life &#38; labors of the deceased &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#45;&#45;Berakhoth 3<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41;&#44; it<lb/> would not have comported with the scope of the pulpit &#38; of the synagogue to<lb/> surrender them to every &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But in this country &#38; in modern congre&#45;<lb/>gations&#44; where the minister&#44; in stricter consonance with the Kalakhah &#40;M. Kab.<lb/> 24<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#59; Y. D. 344 &#167;4&#44; et al.&#41;&#44; delivers an address on the death of even a young child&#59;<lb/> where no line of demarcation is drawn between the high &#38; the low&#44; between the<lb/> rich &#38; the poor&#44; &#38; where every such sad occasion is attended by a numerous<lb/> assembly of friends &#38; acquaintances of the deceased&#44; or of the bereaved&#44; or of<lb/> both&#58; the synagogue is&#44; in my humble opinion&#44; the proper place for the fu&#45;<lb/>neral address which combines the subjective &#38; the objective&#58; consolation for<lb/> the mourners &#38; instruction for all.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93; is&#44; that the inhibitory clause of our Halakhah is in&#45;<lb/>applicable to our times &#38; customs&#44; &#38; that the modern Jewish funeral may&#44; or<lb/> should take place in the synagogue&#44; in the public house of public prayer<lb/> &#38; public instruction.<lb/></p>
            <p>But how about the corpse&#58; may that be brought into the synagogue<lb/> without doing violence to the sanctity of the place&#63;  Though our Halakhah<lb/> permits&#44; or ordains&#44; the holding of the &#91;Hebrew&#93; in the synagogue&#44; it does<lb/> not yet permit the presence of the corpse.  Indeed&#44; from the concatenation of the<lb/> Talmudic rules&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;M. Katon 28<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#41; &#38; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;ib 27<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41;&#44; both of which<lb/> are accepted Halakhoth &#40;Maim. H.

            <p>reasonably infer that the &#91;Hebrew&#93; was delivered without the presence of the subject&#44; even<lb/> after burial&#59; while our funeral services are held before burial &#38; in the presence<lb/> of the remains&#58; may this be done in the synagogue&#63;  Again &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>In &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;344 &#167;20&#41; we find the following Halakhah&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  This rule is incorporated in &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#40;l. e.&#44; end&#41; on the authority of Haggaon Hai&#59; &#38; although &#91;Hebrew&#93; it can not be<lb/> traced further back&#44; it suffices for the present to know that the &#91;Hebrew&#93; admits<lb/> human remains into the &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  It is true&#44; the admission granted in these cases<lb/> is a concession to greatness&#44; but it nevertheless shows that the &#91;Hebrew&#93; did not con&#45;<lb/>sider it a desecration of the sacred edifice.  We now turn to the Mishnah&#44; &#38;<lb/> here &#40;Yadayim IV &#167;6&#41; we find R. Yohanan ben Zaccai endeavoring to account<lb/> for certain rules concerning ritualistic uncleanness&#44; &#38; as the best reason for as&#45;<lb/>signing the power of contamination to human bones&#44; &#38; not to those of the brute&#44; he&#45;&#45;<lb/> R. Yohanan ben Zaccai&#44; who elsewhere &#40;Numb. R. s. XIX&#59; Tanhuma Huccath &#167;8&#41; is<lb/> reported as saying&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#45;&#45;<del>asserts</del> offers the <hi rend="underline">argumentum ad</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">hominem</hi>&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;; &#38; accordingly&#44; if &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Hullin 33<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#41;&#44; &#38; yet<lb/> the Gaon&#39;s remains do not desecrate the sacred edifice&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93; that the remains<lb/> of the lower classes can not desecrate it&#33;&#45;&#45;But there is no occasion for<lb/> diving in the depths of obstruse reasoning.  R. Akiba exaltingly exclaims&#58;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Pessahim 19<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#41;&#44; &#38; on the authority of a Baraitha&#44; the<lb/> Talmud &#40;Yer.

            <p>And still another question.  If in the foregoing I have succeeded in correctly<lb/> interpreting the Halakhah&#44; &#38; proved that&#44; accordingly&#44; the remains may be brought into the<lb/></p>

            <p>The Gemara &#40;Yer.

The same precedent is quoted in illustration of the above Barai<lb/>tha &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Now&#44; since it is admitted that the funeral address&#44; like any other<lb/> address based on Jewish doctrine&#44; is &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; it clearly follows that the &#91;Hebrew&#93; may attend<lb/> funeral services.  And should it be objected to the high position here assigned to the<lb/> funeral address&#44; then the &#91;Hebrew&#93; should be obliged to attend for the sake of the funeral it&#45;<lb/>self.  For whether the &#91;Hebrew&#93; or &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Sanh. 46<hi rend="sup">b</hi> sq.&#41;&#44; it is &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; we<lb/> have just seen that the Talmud states&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; which state&#45;<lb/>ment reappears elsewhere &#40;Yer. Berakh. III &#167;1&#45;&#45;p. 6<hi rend="sup">b</hi> top&#41; in an amplified &#38; Halakhic<lb/> form&#59; thus&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;xxx&#63;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.&#45;&#45;Again the &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;Y. D. 371 &#167;5&#41; permits the<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; to stand by the funeral couch&#44; because &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#38; surely it will not be averred that the corpse&#44;<lb/> encased in a coffin &#38; resting on a bier&#44; can acquire a right to the place in the sy&#45;<lb/>nagogue&#33;  And as there is no right of acquisition&#44; there is no possibility of con<lb/>tamination by proximity &#40;cf. Sotah 44<hi rend="sup">a</hi>&#59; Maimon. H. Abel III &#167; 13; Y. D.&#44; l. c.&#41;.<lb/>  Above all&#44; we must remember&#44; as Maimonides expresses it &#40;More IIII&#44; 47&#41;&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; the Talmud &#40;Taanith 17&#41; permits the &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> to drink wine &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#40;cf. Rashi ad l. &#38; Tosaforth ib. s. v. &#91;Hebrew&#93;; also &#91;Hebrew&#93; ad l. s. v. 137&#41;.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>In conclusion&#44; I beg leave to add the following.  Maimonides &#40;H. Tumath Meth XII &#167;6&#41;&#44;<lb/> on good Talmudic authority &#40;cf. Berakhoth 19<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41;&#44; distinctly states that &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Now&#44; as in this coun&#45;<lb/>try the remains are never carried out on a funeral couch &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;&#44; but always in coffins&#44; there<lb/> is accordingly no room for the apprehension of contamination&#59; &#38; although the sources quoted<lb/> add&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; we may reasonably hold to the main<lb/> Halakhah&#44; since our coffins are <hi rend="underline">invariably</hi> spacious&#44; <hi rend="underline">always</hi> leaving between the corpse &#38; the<lb/> lid more vacuum than the Halakhah requires.  Again&#44; the Talmud &#40;Meg. 26<hi rend="sup">b</hi>&#41; &#38; the casuists<lb/> declare &#91;Hebrew&#93;; &#38; since coffins are certainly &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> at least the wooden ones are &#91;Hebrew&#93;.&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>From all of the above it clearly appears to my mind&#58;<lb/>
                1. That to hold funeral services in the synagogue can not be &#91;Hebrew&#93; public<lb/> funerals having been held in synagogues early in the common era.<lb/>
                2. That modern Jewish funerals&#44; differing as they do from those of Talmudic times<lb/> in many respects &#38;&#45;&#45;the occasional costly casket &#38; display of flowers notwithstand&#45;<lb/>ing&#45;&#45;being free from that pomp &#38; pageantry which constituted ancient funeral cere&#45;<lb/>monies &#38; which probably suggested their being considered in connection with &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; do not fall under the Halakhic interdict even as to &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/>
                3. That the modern Jewish funeral is&#44; in every case &#38; <hi rend="underline">literally</hi>&#44; a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#38; there&#45;<lb/>fore may be held in the synagogue &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/>
                4. That&#44; as funeral services are attended even by those of our race who hardly ever<lb/> take occasion to recollect that they are born Jews&#44; &#38; as the funeral address&#44; embo&#45;<lb/>dying the objective as well as the subjective&#44; may have the effect of awakening<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>them to their duties as Jews&#58; funeral services ought to be held in the synagogue &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/>
                5. That the remains may be brought into the synagogue&#44; without fear of thereby<lb/> desecrating the sacred edifice&#44; particularly if they are enclosed in a coffin.<lb/>
                6. That the &#91;Hebrew&#93; may attend such funeral services for the sake of both &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#38; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>And now&#44; Rev. sir&#44; having to the best of my ability&#45;&#45;&#38;&#44; let me hope&#44; also to<lb/> your satisfaction&#45;&#45;submitted my authorities for my views on the question at issue&#44; I<lb/> crave your authoritative &#38; categoric opinion.  I conscientiously believe to have in the<lb/> above presented the Halakhah &#38; its bearings&#44; the premises &#38; the conclusions&#58; am I mis&#45;<lb/>taken&#44; or am I correct&#63;  This&#44; I earnestly trust&#44; you will answer.  If I am mistaken&#44;<lb/> kindly point out my mistakes&#59; if I am correct&#44; considerately endorse me.  In either<lb/> case I shall greatly appreciate your prompt reply&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>With highest regards &#38; best wishes&#44; I have the honor of being&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> Sincerely your pupil<lb/> S. Mendelsohn<lb/> Rabbi Congr. &#34;Temple of Israel.&#34;<lb/>
