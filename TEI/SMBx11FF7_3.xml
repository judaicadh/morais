            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>How worthless my official ministration would be&#44;<lb/> if I were simply to tell why the unexpected death<lb/> of Mrs J. I. gives special cause for mourning and la&#45;<lb/>&#45;mentation&#33;  I have always held as a useless re&#45;<lb/>&#45;ligion that which can intensify sorrow&#44; but cannot<lb/> mitigate it&#59; that which has readily at its command<lb/> the means of drawing tears of anguish&#44; but which is<lb/> destitute of any power to wipe them away.  Now&#58;<lb/> some within reach of my voice may perhaps have<lb/> mingled in the festive circle that only ten days ago<lb/> enlivened this habitation.  Without my recalling that<lb/> whose mention must occasion distress&#44; they will remem&#45;<lb/>&#45;ber the mother wrapped in her just wedded daughter&#44;<lb/> recuring accepting congratulations&#44; thankfully yet composedly&#44;<lb/> not mirthfully For to me she said that wishing her<lb/> child the widest share of human happiness&#44; she<lb/> nevertheless almost regretted that another should become<lb/> with her the recipient of an affection which she had<lb/> solely enjoyed.  Was that utterance the foreshadow&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing of so near a sad future&#63;  Was it a vague presenti&#45;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>&#45;ment that maternal ties would so very soon<lb/> be severed on earth&#44; and that the marital ones would<lb/> naturally grow stronger by reason of her absence&#63;  I<lb/> know not&#44; but the strange thought flashes across the<lb/> mind&#44; and elicits deep sympathy.  Then&#44; again&#44;<lb/> the reflection that the husband of the deceased&#44; who&#44;<lb/> by his own confession&#44; clung to his wife with a<lb/> feeling of dependence&#44; and needed her judgment and<lb/> womanly thrift&#44; has remained suddenly bereft of so<lb/> essential a support&#59; the reflection that an only<lb/> son arrived at manhood&#44; was wont still to bend<lb/> and listen to his mother&#39;s counsel&#44; to him so<lb/> important&#44; and that to the innocent creatures born<lb/> of her oldest&#44; the endearments of the departed were<lb/> sweet&#44; all those considerations must draw forth<lb/> sobs and sighs.  But not to produce them&#44; have<lb/> I taken my stand beside this coffin.  Our sister in<lb/> faith has indeed left by her demise a void in her<lb/> home&#44; which will long be felt&#44; and for the sake of<lb/> her life&#45;companion now inconsolable&#44; and ever here&#45;<lb/>&#45;after greatly bereaved&#44; we are principally sorry.<lb/>  But the religion I teach has promises hailing<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>from Eden&#44; redolent of joys.  God&#39;s breathing<lb/> which inspired intellectual creatures with knowledge&#44;<lb/> expires not.  It outlives the dissolution of the<lb/> instruments by which it acted here below&#44; to soar aloft<lb/> on the heights of immortality &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Surely&#44; there abides a spirit in man&#44; and the breath<lb/> of the Almighty gives them understanding.&#34;<lb/>  What duties then devolve upon the living&#44; who loved<lb/> the beings imparadised&#44; while embodied in a perishable<lb/> form&#63;  Are mere conventionalities&#44; the face&#45;darkening<lb/> veil and the hanging crape evidences of the inner<lb/> belief stirring up to action&#63;  Or&#44; is the bare repetition<lb/> of prayers&#44; hastily and unmeditatively recited&#44; fitting me&#45;<lb/>&#45;morials of those whom we cherish and delight to honor&#63;<lb/>  To think so&#44; is an offence to the teachings of the faith<lb/> we profess.  In the name of that faith I am commis&#45;<lb/>&#45;sioned to say to our brother and to his children&#44; who<lb/> bewail a terrestrial separation&#58; Rise above your grief.<lb/>  Comfort one another by deeds of righteousness.  Whatever<lb/> you will henceforth perform&#44; which is practically Jewish<lb/> in the way of piety&#44; of humanity&#44; of self&#45;control&#44; of<lb/> self&#45;denial&#44; of mutual forgiveness and forbearance&#44; do<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>it with a mind directed to the departed&#44; for her<lb/> sake&#44; for her glorification&#44; and she who now can com&#45;<lb/>&#45;prehend what she could but partially grasp when<lb/> clothed in flesh&#44; will accept your kindly sentiments.<lb/>  With a grateful soul she will beseech God that such<lb/> a happiness may attend you&#44; as it follows the exer&#45;<lb/>&#45;cises of what constitutes veritable Judaism&#44; for it is<lb/> written&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;blessings will crown the head<lb/> of the just.&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>Pour forth consolations&#44; O compassionate Lord&#44; on a<lb/> family in Israel.  Deign to dispel the gloom into<lb/> which a sudden loss&#44; great and irreparable on earth&#44;<lb/> has cast a father and his offspring.  May they be<lb/> infused with a profound sense of Thy justice in deal&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing with no mortals&#44; and obtain relief and satis&#45;<lb/>&#45;faction by a demeanour befe <sic>benefitting</sic> Thy less favored<lb/> creatures&#44; enhancing the heavenly joys of the depart&#45;<lb/>ed&#44; and sanctifying Thy unity&#44; O Lord and King<lb/> of the Universe&#44; the only Protector of our race&#44; and<lb/> the Saviour of all mankind.  Amen.<lb/></p>
