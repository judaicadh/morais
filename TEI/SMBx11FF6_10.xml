            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>
                PHILADELPHIA.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>There exist many species of heroism.  Men are<lb/> apt to attribute it that virtue mainly&#44; if not solely&#44; to those&#44;<lb/> who&#44; on the battle field&#44; jeopardize life to carry off<lb/> as trophies tattered banners&#59; or&#44; who leave upon the<lb/> ground&#44; drenched in blood&#44; the dying and the dead of<lb/> an inimical host.  Doubtless&#44; he is a hero&#44; who fights<lb/> for the conquest of right and of liberty.  He is also a hero<lb/> who&#44; to rescue another being from dangers which are<lb/> imminent&#44; risks his own existence.  I acknowledge he&#45;<lb/>&#45;roism in the act of putting vulgar seductions to the<lb/> flight with the arms of moral force&#44; or in rising overcoming<lb/> above difficulties&#44; which threaten to unman us.<lb/>  But there is a species of heroism which few consider<lb/> worthy of any credit&#44; and which&#44; according to a novel<lb/> gospel&#44; some men persons are taught to regard even as cowardice itself.<lb/>  It is the heroism of suffering physical tortures<lb/> unmurmuringly&#59; bearing the visitations of Providence<lb/> resignedly&#44; never attempting to enter into jud&#45;<lb/>&#45;gment with the Maker of the human frame&#59;<lb/> never harboring the wicked thought of cutting<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>asunder the threads that hold together the spirit<lb/> with and the flesh together.  Now&#44; believing that the<lb/> report given me by a son of the Jewess who lies<lb/> enshrouded in this coffin&#44; must be&#44; un free from exaggerating<lb/> it behooves me to commend the heorine who en&#45;<lb/>&#45;dured paroxysims of pains&#44; fierce bodily thrusts<lb/> which might have maddened others&#44; still keeping<lb/> as serene as nature would allow&#44; not to distress<lb/> dear ones that ministered to her wants.  All honor<lb/> to her&#44; all glory to her memory&#44; and verily if the ma&#45;<lb/>&#45;xim of Israel&#39;s sages be drawn from on high&#59; if<lb/> our trials are the crucible in which our dross is<lb/> cleansed&#44; and whence we come forth purified sevenfold&#44;<lb/> then the departed has returned to her Creator pur&#45;<lb/>&#45;ged of her impurities&#44; whether contracted by leaving<lb/> the path of revealed religion behind&#44; or by <sic>yeilding</sic><lb/> to the foibles that we all are heir to.  May her<lb/> heroism under the fire of storming long besieging death&#44; joint<lb/> to the exercise of womanly virtues in the various<lb/> relations of life&#44; as a child&#44; a sister&#44; a wife&#44;<lb/> a mother and a daughter of Israel&#44; have ensure<lb/>d to her undying soul&#44; bliss ineffable and ever lasting.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>But I would be guilty of unpardonable negligence&#44;<lb/> and I would do violence to my own feelings&#44; if<lb/> while bestowing a meed of praise on the deceased<lb/> for her heroic fortitude&#44; I did not duly honor<lb/> the loving kindness which assuaged suffering&#44;<lb/> and softened the aching pillow of an agonizing<lb/> mother.  Yes&#58; in the name of the religion<lb/> which has promised blessings endurable here and<lb/> hereafter to filial devotion&#44; I extol and thank<lb/> the offspring of Mrs T. S.&#44; whose obedience to<lb/> the fifth behest of the Decalogue&#44; rendered the<lb/> transition&#44; always fearful to contemplate&#44; less<lb/> harrowing.  May your reward I...whom I know<lb/> by an enviably through a well earned wide reputation&#44; and all of you&#44; sons<lb/> and daughters of......&#44; with whom I am<lb/> not acquainted&#59; may I say your recompense for<lb/> having performed a heaven&#45;given command&#44; be<lb/> abundant and continuous.  May the Almighty<lb/> hover above your household even as the ancient Teachers of<lb/> our people have declared&#44; that to be devoted to<lb/> our parents&#44; is to draw the Divinity towards<lb/> us and secure His dwelling in our midst.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>And upon this day&#44; on which we enter<lb/> the mouth of Elul&#44; the precursor of that<lb/> solemn season&#44; during which the faithful<lb/> seek to propitiate the pardon&#44; grace and<lb/> compassion of the Most High&#44; be the herald<lb/> of consolation to the bereaved&#59; the harbinger<lb/> of social and political advancement to<lb/> persecuted Israel&#44; and the forerunner of the<lb/> elevation of the living and the beatification<lb/> of the dead.  Amen.<lb/></p>
