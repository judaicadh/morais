            <p>Rev. S. Morais<lb/>
                Rev &#38; Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>Your welcome favor of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is duly<lb/> at hand.  Though there is a mass of miscellaneous work<lb/> on my desk I give an answer to your&#39;s the preference.  Per&#44;<lb/>mit me to thank you for your kind sentiments.  I fer&#44;<lb/>vently second the good wishes you are kind enough to<lb/> express concerning my boy.  He is growing nicely and pro<lb/>mises to be a sturdy&#44; healthy&#44; little fellow.  I must also<lb/> thank you for your encouraging remarks.  I have always<lb/> endeavored to merit your good opinion&#8212;of great value<lb/> to me&#44; and shall continue to do so.  Whatever Providence<lb/> may have in store for me I shall accept as my mission<lb/> in life.  For the present my course lies through the<lb/> wilds of Texas and Louisiana.  The South&#8212;spite all<lb/> that apologists may say to the contrary&#8212;is an &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Religion is largely at a discount&#44; and I<lb/> feel that i am wanted here.  Thus far I have done<lb/> my duty&#44; though my path is beset with difficulties.<lb/>  I shall struggle&#59; and if my labors will be crowned<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>with that degree of success that hitherto has attended<lb/> them I shall have every reason to thank God and be<lb/> satisfied.  My labors are for the present&#44; my studies for<lb/> the future.<lb/></p>
            <p>My health&#44; for the present&#44; is quite good again&#44; though<lb/> there is no telling when the fever may return.  I am stri<lb/>ving to keep it away permanently by occasional doses<lb/> of quinine&#44; plenty of exercise at the dawn of day<lb/> and a subsequent cold water bath.  Between the hours<lb/> of nine and six it is impossible to be in the streets.<lb/>  It is almost &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  With the <sic>thermomether</sic><lb/> 99&#176; in the shade&#44; we have neither rest nor comfort&#44; until<lb/> at nights the cool breezes from the Gulf reinvigorate<lb/> exhausted nature.<lb/></p>
            <p>Concerning the &#91;Hebrew&#93; you speak of&#44; you will<lb/> permit me to say a few words.  It has been a source<lb/> of annoyance to me&#44; that my name has been connected<lb/> with an affair for which I was not in the least<lb/> responsible.  I am candid enough to confess to you<lb/> my friend and adviser&#8212;that my letter to the Ame<lb/>rican Israelite was written under the influence of the<lb/> malicious blow&#44; but at my congregation by an ano&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>nymous correspondent in the same paper.  Its author<lb/> is a lesser&#45;social and religious&#45;&#45;&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  A low&#45;life&#44; without principle&#44; name or character&#44;<lb/> an Ishmaelite&#44; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The man is a quasi<lb/> orthodox&#44; but observes nothing.  His orthodoxy consists solely<lb/> as reviling my congregation in particular and &#34;reform&#34; in ge<lb/>neral.  He is an ignorant&#44; vulgar tradesman why must he<lb/> constitute himself censor&#63;  <hi rend="underline">He</hi> should have kept his peace<lb/> and leave stricture&#45;making to such as are fit and<lb/> able.  You will object that such as he are not worthy<lb/> of notice&#44; no matter what they say&#59; at this time I grant<lb/> that objection but at the time when I saw my congre<lb/>gation reviled in the American Israelite and knowing<lb/> well what a precious morsel of gossip it would be<lb/> for the would&#45;be Jewish papers my blood&#44; &#34;rose<lb/> within me&#34; and I wrote that annihilating letter.<lb/>  I am sincerely sorry for some of its phrases<lb/> but the man deserved it&#8212;and more.  As to the<lb/> fact &#34;of what happened&#8212;at a late festivity&#34;<lb/> I was ignorant of the very fact of there being<lb/> a supper until I came to the ball room.  When<lb/></p>

            <p>I noticed the disregard of <hi rend="underline">Kashrut</hi> I was sparing<lb/> in neither strictures nor demonstrations.  But <hi rend="underline">cui bono</hi>&#63;<lb/>  It was an affair with which neither the congregation<lb/> nor its minister were concerned.  The publicity given<lb/> to the matter by the Jewish Record and its unfavorable<lb/> comment upon the same as well as its &#34;slap&#34; at<lb/> myself are the result of Mr. Jones&#39; unwarrantable<lb/> hatred towards myself.  Of this I will not speak<lb/> now.  I have not noticed the attack nor will I do<lb/> so but &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Believe me&#44; dear sir&#44; that I<lb/> have deplored the occurrence.  But I was not to be<lb/> silent and see a low&#45;life make statements&#44; devoid<lb/> of truth.  It was more the man&#44; to whom I objected<lb/> than his statements.  The latter would have received a<lb/> different reply had they come from a different<lb/> source.  And now&#44; let us leave this matter rest.  I<lb/> trust that my explanation has satisfied you.  Time<lb/> is beginning to be very valuable to me now and though<lb/> reluctantly&#44; I close with my heartfelt wishes for<lb/> your long life and happiness.  In my next permit me<lb/> to discuss matters of a different and more inte<lb/>resting nature.  Please let me hear from you.  Sincerely Yours Jacob Voorsanger<lb/></p>
