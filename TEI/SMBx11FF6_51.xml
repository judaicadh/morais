        <body>       
                                

                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>a funeral address<lb/></p>
            
            <p>Not as an official privilege&#44; but as a favor to one that loved<lb/> this sainted being&#44; I ask that I may be allowed to speak.<lb/>  It is not my purpose to utter pronounce a studied eulogy.  My words<lb/> flow from are the reflection of a <sic>a</sic> heart filled with grief.  For&#44; to know my<lb/> departed friend&#44; was to conceive for her filial affection.<lb/>  Not one of her virtues was assumed.  Real&#44; sterling&#44; noble<lb/> and soul&#45;inspiring were all the traits of her character.<lb/>  She captivated the young by her suavity of manners&#59; she<lb/> won the respect of the old aged by her deferential demeanour.<lb/>  To the high&#45;born and to the lowly she exhibited the same calm<lb/> and placid siren temperament.  Unsurpassed in gentleness&#44;<lb/> she still was unflinching unyielding in the principles of her faith.<lb/>  Never could she be lured away from the path&#44; which the<lb/> religion of Israel points out.  Scrupulous in the perfor&#45;<lb/>&#45;mance of her duties&#44; she nevertheless evinced eagerness<lb/> in to learning how best to she could server her God&#44; and her fellow&#45;mortals.<lb/>  And my humble self she would frequently request to lend her<lb/> such writings as might enlighten her understanding.<lb/>  She loathed sin&#44; yet her lips spoke but kindness for the<lb/> sinner.  Feeling that to err is but human&#44; she would readily offered some<lb/> palliations for her <sic>nighborer&#39;s</sic> offences.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>The scanty means acquired by dint of indefatigable industry&#44;<lb/> she found to be superabundant&#44; when the needy cried for help.<lb/>  Like the virtuous woman depicted in the last chapter of Proverbs&#44;<lb/> the hand wherewith she plied the needle&#44; she also stretched<lb/> forth to aid raise the necessitous fallen.  And both not rarely could the unworthy<lb/> as the deserving could open with them plaintive sounds of the verses<lb/> the heart whence streamed gushed forth a stream of charity and compassion.<lb/>  But to judge adequately of the virtues which adorned my<lb/> deceased friend&#44; she must have been seen when around her<lb/> family hearth.  There did the full radiance of her<lb/> noble character shine in its full radiance.  There in whose veins courses<lb/> her own blood have experienced how angelically pure were her<lb/> sentiments.  Novelists may have delineated<lb/> in brilliant colours the strength of natural affections.  Poets may have dressed invested with all the charms of their<lb/> vivid imaginations the intensity of human love&#44; but he<lb/> who has studied the character of Sarah Lobo&#44; had seen<lb/> how boundless is the capacity of a woman&#39;s tender heart.<lb/>  Aye&#44; tell me not that age blunts our feelings.  The<lb/> silvery chords that bind two youthful hearts beings together&#44; cannot<lb/> be drawn so tightly as those which linked united my deceased lamented friend<lb/> to with her brother.  This coffin declares how mighty was her love.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>And to her son&#63;...Will I be able&#44; to draw a single faint line of<lb/> that immeasurable affection she bore him.  Of Picture those tokens<lb/> of maternal endearments&#44; of those warm kisses and maternal fond caresses&#44;<lb/> of that anxiety at his absence&#44; of that trilling joy at his return&#33;&#33;<lb/>  No&#44; were I even endowed with all the powers equal to<lb/> the task&#44; I could not exercise them.  Stricken with<lb/> grief&#44; I can only offer a tear of sympathy.<lb/></p>
            <p>And you dear surviving relatives your daughter of her choice&#44; you self sacrificing Leah you all sweet friend&#44; who<lb/> knew the sterling qualities of the departed&#44; and feel how of inexpressibly sad it<lb/> is never again to look upon the face of a being so good&#44; so<lb/> estimable so exemplary in all the relations of life&#44; pray for the con&#45;<lb/>&#45;solation of the bereaved son&#44; and the doubly afflicted<lb/> brother.  Pray that the one may be comforted by the thought<lb/> that God is &#34;a righteous Judge&#44;&#34; and but also a solace unto those&#44;<lb/> who cast their burden upon His throbbing breast.  Pray<lb/> that the suffering of the other may be assuaged&#44; and he<lb/> may yet be spared to his devoted wife&#44; and to many who<lb/> besides like her respect esteem of his virtues and2 appreciate1 his great worth.<lb/></p>
                <p>And thou gentle spirit of Sarah Lobo&#44; that hast taken thy flight soared aloft to<lb/> the abode of eternity&#33;  Look down yet once upon those who mourn for their ir&#45;<lb/>&#45;reparable loss.  For their sake prostrate thyself at the foot of the throne of the<lb/> Merciful God Our he whose contemplation thou art imparadised.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Beseech the Almighty Creator that we also they may<lb/> experience a foretaste of the joys in which thou delightest&#44;<lb/> so that fortitude and resignation may uphold them&#44; and<lb/> they may bless the hand &#34;that woundeth but bindeth up&#44;<lb/> stricketh but also healeth.  Amen so may it be.  Amen.<lb/></p>
