            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen&#33;  Among all the lessons of the late<lb/> <sic>itenerant</sic> evangelist&#44;&#45;&#45;as reflected in the daily papers&#44; one<lb/> may be set to his credit as sensible and much to the purpose.<lb/>  He said in our city&#44; while on a conversion tour&#44; that no<lb/> lecture should occupy more than forty minutes.  But the<lb/> ambitious gospel&#45;gossip spoiled the text by its comment.<lb/>  He added that the audience must leave the meeting&#45;house<lb/> hungry&#44; hungry&#44; of course&#44; for my more preaching.<lb/>  Now&#44; I quite agree with him in the premises&#44; but I differ<lb/> widely in the conclusion.  I say&#58; a lecture should not<lb/> exceed forty minutes in its delivery&#44; let lest it nauseate<lb/> a squeamish people&#44; impairing their appetite for more<lb/> relishing food.  Guided by that idea&#44; I will economise<lb/> time&#44; and you shall not&#44; I promise&#44; be prevented from<lb/> enjoying with zest&#44; what has been laid in store for your<lb/> real entertainment this evening.  For&#44; I acknowledge at<lb/> once&#44; that notwithstanding my earnest wish to find what<lb/> might combine amusement with instruction&#44; every effort<lb/> of mine in that direction&#44; proved a complete failure.<lb/>  But since I have been asked to stand before so large and<lb/></p>

            <p>intelligent an audie assembly&#44; I beg in turn that<lb/> I may be allowed the company of a person I have long<lb/> and dearly loved.  I would much like to introduce him<lb/> to your acquaintance.  Ah&#33;  I see&#44; your curiosity has<lb/> been excited.  &#34;Who can that be&#63;&#34;  &#34;Some old Rabbi&#44;<lb/> to be sure&#34; answer my knowing hearers yonder&#44; to one ano&#45;<lb/>&#45;ther.  No&#58; he was not a Rabbi&#44; in the acceptation<lb/> of the word.  He was not even a Hebrew.  But according<lb/> to my ideal of a being in whose veins runs the blood<lb/> of the great believer from Ur of the Chaldeans&#44; and according<lb/> to the model I have formed of one commissioned to teach<lb/> Truth&#44; my fondly cherished friend bore the highest type<lb/> of a Hebrew&#44; the deepest impress of a Rabbi.  Aye&#58; a<lb/> Melchizedek was he&#44; ministering at the altar of the<lb/> Most High God.  Born at a gloomy period of<lb/> his country&#39;s history&#44; when to be suspect of liberal<lb/> thoughts&#44;&#45;&#45;of such thoughts&#44; as you&#44; Americans&#44; have<lb/> been privileged for a century fearlessly to utter&#45;&#45;&#44; was to<lb/> be shut out of the world&#44; and be left to pine away within<lb/> four impenetrable walls&#44; my friend dared not alone to<lb/> think&#44; but to act manfully&#44; unflinchingly.  He saw<lb/> his native land bound in chains&#44; whose every link had<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>been twice clinched.  Austria had forged the shackles&#44;<lb/> the Bourbons on one side&#44; and the Popes on the other struck<lb/> the heaviest blows to fasten them terribly tight.  He<lb/> saw his land drag those enslaving ch fetters&#44; and still<lb/> he made to revel in Carnivals&#44; that the noise of riotous<lb/> feasting&#44; might drown the sound of weeping.  But<lb/> a youth had heard that cry of misery.  And drawn within<lb/> the weep of a temple dedicated to God&#44; even his own pure<lb/> heart&#44; vowed to sacrifice the joys of home&#44; the endear&#45;<lb/>&#45;ments of a widowed mother&#44; the chaste love of woman&#44;<lb/> the bright prospects which his surpassing genius opened&#44;<lb/> he vowed to bless suffering&#44; and welcome poverty&#44; that<lb/> the work of redemption he had determined to undertake<lb/> might never slack.  How faithfully he labored&#44; Italy<lb/> reunited from the foot of the Alps to the Adriatic Sea&#44;<lb/> proclaims to an astonished world.  For&#44; if the right<lb/> hand of Cavour shook off the dust of ages&#44; under<lb/> which the classic peninsula had lain burned&#44; and<lb/> brought her forth arrayed in holiday garments&#44; if Gari&#45;<lb/>&#45;baldi girded her loins with a newly sharpened sword&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>Joseph Mazzini kept her alive&#44; when all thought<lb/> her dead&#44; dead beyond resurrection.  He kept her<lb/> alive by infusing into her inl veins his own precious<lb/> blood&#44; he kept her warm with the blazing fire of his<lb/> heavenly soul&#44; and &#91;&#63;&#93; like an angel of promise&#44; he<lb/> whispered words of comfort and of hope.<lb/></p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen.  Joseph Mazzini is the dear<lb/> friend I have brought with me&#44; and whom I desire to<lb/> introduce to your acquaintance.  Could some allusions&#44;<lb/> necessarily slight and desultory to his character and services&#44;<lb/> inspire my audience&#44; partly at least&#44; with the sentiments<lb/> which the mere mention of his name awakens in my<lb/> breast&#44; I would feel as if that chief of the greatest<lb/> and the best among Italian patriots&#44; stood now by me&#44;<lb/> and with a saintly smile evinced gratification.<lb/>  For&#44; he labored to be eternized in the memory of the freedom&#45;<lb/>loving&#59; he labored for all mankind&#44; in whom he recognized<lb/> brethren&#44; members of a vast family&#44; created to attest<lb/> the glory of the One Universal Father.<lb/></p>
            <p>Those among my hearers&#44; conversant with the political<lb/> events which followed one another on the continent of<lb/> Europe since 1830&#44; and notably since the mighty<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>upheaval of the never to be forgotten 1848&#44; may have<lb/> learnt to look upon Mazzini as on a restless conspirator&#59;<lb/> as a visionary unscrupulous of the means to which he<lb/> resorted&#44; in order to set up a <sic>utopean</sic> Republic.  There<lb/> never was a judgment more faulty than this bred and<lb/> fostered by the corrupt emissaries of corruptive govern&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment.  That many a noble youth kindled with enthu&#45;<lb/>&#45;siasm by the teachings of the Apostle of truth&#44; bent to re&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceive the death&#45;shot as light&#45;heartedly as a fond child<lb/> runs to his mother&#39;s arms&#44; I do not deny.  That what he<lb/> spoke and wrote set Italy on a political volcano&#44;<lb/> which threatened streaming forth lava&#44; which threatened<lb/> to consume royalty&#44; I will not gainsay.  But Mazzini<lb/> never descended from the high pedestal on which Nature<lb/> had placed him.  Never did he point to the dagger&#44;<lb/> even to rid his country of the brutal Hynaus&#44; the women&#39;s<lb/> floggers&#44; and the children&#39;s butchers.  Revolution&#45;&#45;a word<lb/> which you whose badge is independence thoroughly un&#45;<lb/>&#45;derstand&#44; revolution he preached and not assassination.<lb/>  From Genoa&#44; the city which sent her Columbus to search<lb/></p>

            <p>out for you a country&#44; those stirring words issued<lb/> forth.  In Genoa&#45;&#45;his native place&#45;&#45;Mazzini struck<lb/> the first spark of the refulgent light&#44; which will<lb/> ultimately illumine the political horizon of the whole<lb/> world&#58; The light of righteousness..<lb/></p>
            <p>The bold young man who ventured to call upon a people<lb/> to become emancipated from the rules of the Vatican&#44;<lb/> and its soul&#45;crushing superstitions&#44; to throw off the yoke<lb/> of absolutism&#44; which burdened them with overwhelming<lb/> ignorance&#59; a young man so dangerous to the thrones<lb/> propped up by a blind belief in the infallibility of<lb/> Papacy&#44; and by a cowardly submission to foreign usur&#45;<lb/>&#45;pation&#44; could not long walk at large in the Italy<lb/> of forty years ago.  He was cast into a felon&#39;s cell.<lb/>  At the end of six months&#44; the kind&#63; home government<lb/> considering his offence to have emanated perhaps from<lb/> juvenile thoughtlessness&#44; consented with usual clemency<lb/> to escort the giddy&#45;headed patriot beyond the boundaries<lb/> of the land of his birth&#44; and bid him ev never to set his<lb/> foot upon that soil again.<lb/></p>
            <p>In Marseilles France began the apostolate of Mazzim.  A flood<lb/> of iniquities flowing form the Church of Rome&#44; had under&#45;<lb/>mined<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>people&#39;s belief in a wakeful God&#44; and in the final<lb/> triumph of truth.  A new generation had arisen in<lb/> Italy and elsewhere&#44; who confounded the sacred name<lb/> of religion with Papal bulls.  From the height of his<lb/> genius&#44; Mazzini saw that multitude entangled in<lb/> the mazes of Atheism.  He called to them&#44; and showing<lb/> the banner he had unfurled&#44; cried &#34;Lay hold thereon&#44; ye<lb/> heirs of immortality&#59; beneath this standard alone you<lb/> shall be led to safety.&#34;  &#34;God and the people&#34; was the<lb/> motto the great patriot had chosen.  A re&#45;echo&#44; my<lb/> respected hearers&#44; a re&#45;echo of the loving words of your<lb/> Washington when at the close of an irreproachable and<lb/> glorious public career&#59; he commended the interests of the Re&#45;<lb/>&#45;public to the Omnipotent and to the virtues not ex&#45;<lb/>&#45;clusively of a Cabinet or a Hall of Legislators&#44; but to<lb/> the virtues of those who form the sinewy strength of the<lb/> country&#44; to the virtues of the people of the United States&#44;<lb/> whom he had redeemed by his sword and by his wisdom.<lb/>  &#34;God and the people&#34; was the motto inscribed on the<lb/> banner which the unsullied hands of Mazzini had unfolded&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p>and it became the watchword of a society which&#44;<lb/> under the name of &#34;Young Italy&#34; spread throughout the<lb/> European continent.<lb/></p>
            <p>From a hidden chamber at Marseilles&#44; letters and jour&#45;<lb/>&#45;nals and pamphlets proceeded and <sic>travelled</sic> fast.  The<lb/> mighty engines&#44; were they&#44; of a revolution which is pro&#45;<lb/>&#45;gressing&#44; but which is yet far from its completion.<lb/>  For&#44; let it be known&#44; Ladies and Gentlemen&#44; that the illus&#45;<lb/>&#45;trious exile aimed at the social amelioration of his country<lb/> and of the whole human race&#44; through a political reform.<lb/>  While French theorists dreamed of a Democracy resting<lb/> upon a community of property&#44; the Italian apostle<lb/> labored for a Republic founded on the principles of<lb/> duty to one another and of accountability to God.  He<lb/> labored to dignify handicraft&#44; to raise up the masses<lb/> to the height of their manhood&#44; to lower aristocracies from<lb/> their presuming attitude&#59; he labored to train man for self&#45;<lb/>government.  These sentiments&#44; however&#44; did not quite<lb/> agree with the notions of a Ruler&#44; whose shrewd policy<lb/> was directed to secure for his sons and daughters fat berths<lb/> by matrimonial alliances with foreign potentates.<lb/>  &#34;Louis Phillipe&#44; King of the Trench&#44;&#34; for&#44; France herself&#44;<lb/></p>

            <p>forsooth&#44; acknowledge no master&#44;&#45;&#45;though she did not<lb/> disdain afterwards being lorded over by an adventurer&#44; who<lb/> set up his empire upon the corpses of the noblest and<lb/> bravest of her children&#45;&#45;.  Louis Phillipe the veracious king&#44;<lb/> who offered suffering Italy his sympathy as willingly as he<lb/> gave dismembered Poland the yearly promised assist&#45;<lb/>&#45;ance&#44; let his hounds hung for Mazzinis hidden cham&#45;<lb/>&#45;ber&#44; and forced him to flee away.  In the mountains<lb/> of Switzerland&#44; the patriot meditated and planned the<lb/> liberation of his country.  From a solitary spot&#44; he&#44;<lb/> like a prophet of old&#44; launched denunciations against ty&#45;<lb/>&#45;rants&#44; and sent hopeful tidings to the despairing&#44; and<lb/> godly teachings to the world.  But the remonstrances of<lb/> Prince Mettermech&#44;&#45;&#45;the Austrian factotum&#45;&#45;made the<lb/> Helvetic confederacy weak kned kneed.  With a sense<lb/> of humiliation I relate it to you&#44; O representatives of<lb/> national freedom&#33;  She who had often outraged Liberty by<lb/> permitting her soldiers to support the tottering power of<lb/> the Roman Pontiffs&#44; of those who robbed mothers of their<lb/> infants&#44; and sent their sons to the gibbet&#59; Switzerland<lb/></p>

            <p>added to her share by imperatively demanding<lb/> of Mazzini to leave for other parts.<lb/></p>
            <p>But there is an island beyond the ocean&#44; where the<lb/> threats of petty despots meet with the same contempt&#44;<lb/> as their cunning flatteries excite the derision of her<lb/> inhabitants.  It is your mother&#45;country O Americans&#33;<lb/>  At her breast you imbibed the knowledge of those enlightened<lb/> laws which have rendered you an great enlightened and generous<lb/> people.  Great Britain offered an asylum of which<lb/> none dared deprive the honored exile.  And when in 1844<lb/> Sir James Graham debased his character and the name<lb/> he bore by becoming the secret spy of the mis&#45;ruler of Naples&#44;<lb/> a burst of indignation went forth from every high&#45;minded<lb/> Englishman.  The post office at the Metropolis had<lb/> been defiled.  Mazzini&#39;s private correspondence had<lb/> been opened and read&#44; and an iniquitous&#44; a hated govern&#45;<lb/>&#45;ment had been apprized of its contents.  Through<lb/> that disclosure a band of youthful patriots&#44; burning<lb/> with love for their country&#44; on reaching Calabrea met<lb/> the jailors ready with the manacles&#44; and the executioners<lb/> prepared to slaughter.  But the Italian patriot<lb/> lay his grievances at the bar of a public tribunal&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>in a work which revealed all the bleeding wounds of<lb/> his unhappy country.  The people&#39;s verdict was an<lb/> unmeasured condemnation of the ignoble act of one who<lb/> prided himself on his noble extraction.  The people<lb/> whose hearts always throb with sympathetic emotions&#44;<lb/> the people were instinctively drawn to the victim of<lb/> wrong&#44; and they learnt to respect the cause of which<lb/> he was the leading spirit.  A tr Thomas Duncombe&#45;&#45;<lb/>a true nobleman&#45;&#45;made Parliament stand abashed.<lb/>  The great commoner Richard Cobden raised his manly<lb/> voice.  The literary star Douglass Jerrold&#44; figured<lb/> among that constellation of the wise&#45;hearted who deter&#45;<lb/>&#45;mined to resuscitate Italy.  And The National Loan<lb/> to which Mazzinis fervor patriotism set on foot&#44; secured by his fervor the subscriptions of<lb/> Englishmen&#44; &#38; was became the first breathing into a new life<lb/> of the country mouldering in the grave of oblivion.<lb/>  Louis Napoleon saw the dawning of its resurrection<lb/> and trembled.

            <p>Rome had declared itself a Republic&#44; and<lb/> under the triumvirate of Mazzini&#44; Saffi and Armellini&#44;<lb/> but mainly through the statesmanship of the first&#45;named<lb/> great patriot&#44; fought bravely for an existence well<lb/> which the then President of the French Republic threw<lb/> throttled and strangled almost at its birth.  But<lb/> the day of rebrut retribution soon arrived.  Orsini&#39;s plot<lb/> and his infernal machine shook the nephew who<lb/> had mounted the throne upon the <sic>collossal</sic> shoulders<lb/> of his heroic &#91;&#63;&#93; uncle.  He was morally compelled to<lb/> descend to the plains of Mag Magenta and Solferino and<lb/> to aid in the emancipation of Italy.  His sudden<lb/> halt at Villafranca&#44; to prevent the entire liberation<lb/> of the peninsula from the Alps to the Adriatic&#44; as he<lb/> had solemnly promised&#44; did not check Garibaldi&#39;s on&#45;<lb/>&#45;ward march.  And that which was had been left purposely<lb/> unfinished by the Emperor of France&#44; was accom&#45;<lb/>&#45;plished by the help of gigantic Prussia.  She forged<lb/> the thunder&#45;bolts that struck the gates of Papal Rome&#44;<lb/> and opened the way for the people of the Quirinal.<lb/>  She lay hel prl prostate at Sedan&#44; the first born child<lb/> of the Church&#44; the defender of the Vatican.<lb/></p>

            <p>She bet butted the Pope&#39;s bulls with the bullets of her<lb/> Bismark.<lb/></p>
            <p>Upon the day that Italy&#44; assisted by Teutonic valor&#44;<lb/> took her seat among the family of nations&#44; Mazzini<lb/> could have have exchanged exile for a prime&#45;ministry&#44;<lb/> poverty for luxurious ease.  But his mission was not<lb/> yet fulfilled.  The eye of his genius had rested on a<lb/> Republican Italy&#59; and for the rel realization of that<lb/> golden vision he had hopefully waited forty years&#44; now<lb/> with a pen in hand&#44; which seemed dipped in inspi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ration&#44; anon with the unsheathed sword of patriotism.<lb/>  Unwearied in his apostolate&#44; the refugee often left<lb/> his humble setting room at the west end of London&#44; where<lb/> it was my fortune to press his hand&#45;&#45;and <sic>travelled</sic> in<lb/> disguise throughout the continent.  Discovered while<lb/> planning the downfall of royalty&#44; imprisoned and<lb/> condemned to the block&#44; Providence stood by him the just man and<lb/> held him fast.  His priest passed through surging tempestuous<lb/> waters seas&#44; but he was not submerged&#44; the fiery ordeal<lb/> he underwent&#44; did not singe a hair of his head.<lb/></p>
