            <p>&#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; In the Talmud&#44; treatise Rosh Hashan&#225;&#44; we<lb/> read the following paraphrastical sentence &#34;Whoever passes indul&#45;<lb/>&#45;gently by a slight received&#44; will in return obtain the remission of<lb/> all his sins&#44; for it is written &#34;O God&#33; who is like unto thee&#44; who pardonest<lb/> iniquity&#44;&#34; that is&#44; the iniquity of such who pass by the transgression com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mitted against them&#34;.  Beloved hearers&#33;  One of the means which<lb/> the Sages of Israel deem very effective to propitiate our offended<lb/> God&#44; is&#44; to seek a reconciliation with our offended brother.<lb/>  They have therefore recommended that ere the great and tremendous<lb/> day arrives&#44; when our deeds are weighed upon in the scales of divine retributive<lb/> justice&#44; we should strenuously endeavour to pacify our fellow<lb/> man&#44; whose heart our demeanour has alienated from us.<lb/>  They opine that the unsolicited acknowledgment of our fault&#44;<lb/> will best prove our sincerity.  &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;I am humbled&#44; for&#45;<lb/>&#45;give me&#34;.  Such or similar words&#44; flowing from lips that utter<lb/></p>

            <p>the whole truth&#44; will atone for the improper act&#44; of which we have<lb/> been guilty towards our neighbour&#44; and the Universal Father will<lb/> register the goodly expression in the book that lies open before his throne.<lb/>  But while the maxims and talmudical illustrations of the Rab&#45;<lb/>&#45;bins teach that candour and humility&#44; will plead for us on the<lb/> day of judgment&#44; they forcibly demonstrate the contrary effects<lb/> of haughtiness and implacabilityleness.  Accordingly&#44; we read &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;He that is of an unrelenting disposition&#44;<lb/> does not belong to the seed of Abraham&#34; for&#44; the characteristic virtue<lb/> of the latter is mercy in the highest degree &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  But such<lb/> a one&#44; as Maimonides observes in his laws on <sic>repentence</sic>&#44; ought rather<lb/> to be considered as the progeny of the heathen Edomites&#44; of whom the<lb/> prophet says &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;His anger tore perpe&#45;<lb/>&#45;tually&#44; and he kept his wrath for ever&#34;.  Thus likewise&#44; if<lb/> you search through the writings of our ancient tutors instructors&#44; you will learn<lb/> by many other aphorisms of equal import&#44; that a vindictive spirit<lb/></p>

            <p>is held up to utter condemnation abhorrence.<lb/></p>
            <p>Now&#44; my friends&#33;  I am convinced in my mind that each of you<lb/> fully assents to that imparting of the Sages&#59; I am certain that<lb/> none of you will proclaim it a noble trait in man &#34;to avenge<lb/> and bear grudge&#34;; but&#44; Alas&#33; need I say&#44; how frequently that which<lb/> we admit as true in the abstract&#44; is practically repudiated&#63;  Our<lb/> inordinate cravings&#59; self&#45;interest&#44; pride&#44; covetousness&#44; wantonness&#44;<lb/> they obscure the intellect&#44; so that&#44; what we readily condemn in others<lb/> as wicked&#44; fails to impress us with its obliquity when <sic>practised</sic><lb/> by ourselves.  Witness it the penitent King&#44; whom to whose mind only the<lb/> open rebuke of the prophet&#44; could reveal to his mind the enor&#45;<lb/>&#45;mity of his crime.  When the terrible denunciation &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;thou art the man&#34; rung in his ears&#44; then did he perceive how<lb/> the tumult of the passions had overpowered the voice of religion<lb/> and humanity.  Suffer then&#44; beloved hearers&#33; that<lb/> upon this Sabbath which proceeds the awful &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; I<lb/></p>

            <p>may exhibit to view the sin which they commit who refuse their<lb/> brethren the forgiveness they ask of God.  If there be but one<lb/> among us&#44; whose breast&#45;&#45;unconsciously perhaps&#45;&#45;harbours male&#45;<lb/>&#45;volence or aversion&#44; let my friendly admonition awaken him to<lb/> a proper sense of his guilt&#44; so that he may timely bethink himself&#44;<lb/> and by a speedy reconciliation with his fellow&#45;creature&#44; he may<lb/> obtain the love and favor of the eternal Creator.<lb/></p>
            <p>I would then first remark&#44; that the holy religion we profess&#44; does<lb/> not only prohibit open revenge&#44; but denounces as a heinous delin&#45; crime<lb/> &#45;quency even a thought inimical to our fellow&#45;being &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;To exclude the idea&#44;<lb/> say the expositors of our laws&#44; &#34;that only acts of violence are forbidden&#44; the<lb/> Scripture purposely expresses itself in those terms.&#34;  Yes&#58; Our divine legislator&#44;<lb/> who has also framed human nature knows that evil thoughts<lb/> beget evil actions&#59; that mere antipathy will insensibly lapse<lb/></p>

            <p>into rankling hatred&#59; He designed therefore&#44; by his command&#44;<lb/> that we vigilantly a guard against the encroachment of that dire<lb/> passion.  Our beneficent Maker desired that the feelings which<lb/> swell our the bosoms of his children be only kindliness and amity.  He has not<lb/> denied us the privilege of preserving our honor&#44; our life&#44; or our<lb/> property from any detriment to which they might be exposed.  He<lb/> has even sanctioned&#44; in extreme cases&#44; our repelling aggression by<lb/> main force&#44; for&#59; He has exempted from punishment the individual<lb/> who smites a thief while breaking through his premises&#44; under the cover<lb/> of the nightly shadows.  He has granted to all men the right of self&#45;<lb/>defence&#44; for&#44; as our sages express it &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;We must<lb/> prevent the blow which aims at our destruction&#34;&#44; but all this&#44; my<lb/> friends&#33; should be circumscribed within the bounds of that which is<lb/> consonant with the rules of eternal justice.  The acts which<lb/> proceed from our unruly passions&#44; are&#44; on the contrary a violation thereof as<lb/> well as a crime against the Most High God&#59; for nothing can we<lb/></p>

Are we aggrieved by reason of our neigh&#45;<lb/>&#45;bor&#39;s offensive deportment towards us&#63;  We ought to commit our righteous cause<lb/> unto the Lord&#59; to whom vengeance solely belongs &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  We ought to bear<lb/> in mind that the impartial King who abhors a vindictive spirit&#44; has<lb/> likewise threatened our offenders with his celestial wrath&#44; that<lb/> in his revealed book&#44; He demands of them&#44; under penalty of enduring<lb/> torments&#44; the reparation of the injury inflicted&#44; the recantation of<lb/> their aspersions.  Besides&#44; the Deity has delegated to human<lb/> magistrates the authority of watching over our interests.  He has<lb/> delivered into their hands a flaming sword&#44; which&#44; if it does not always<lb/> deter the malefactor from trespassing upon the Eden of our earthly<lb/> existence&#45;&#45;our honor and our substance&#45;&#45;it falls upon his head<lb/> with tremendous force&#44; for&#44; in consenting that we should appeal<lb/> to that tribunal for redress&#44; He has solemnly adjured it to execute<lb/> the law with unflinching inflexibility &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor&#44; nor<lb/></p>

All this has been granted to us every<lb/> one of us&#44; alike for the protection of his life and property&#59; as also<lb/> for the vindication of his character.  Now&#44; say my beloved<lb/> hearers&#33; is not a Monarch so considerate and so beneficent&#44; so<lb/> deeply concerned in our <sic>welbeing</sic>&#44; entitled to our obedience&#63;  See&#33;<lb/>  &#34;He forbids vindictiveness.  But why&#63;  Not as a screen to for the<lb/> adversary of our happiness&#44; but as a token of parental affection towards<lb/> ourselves&#44; for&#44; knowing for certain&#44; that the rancorous feelings<lb/> we cherish&#44; will affect us injuriously&#44; without working prejudicially<lb/> against him who has excited them.  If he is highly stationed&#44; he<lb/> is not brought&#44; through it&#44; to a lowly condition&#44; if he is wealthy&#44; he<lb/> does not grow needy thereby.  Wisely has Solomon asserted &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;that anger&#34;&#45;&#45;which is always the concomitant of<lb/> hatred&#45;&#45;&#34; lodges only in the bosom of the foolish&#34; for the reflecting<lb/> and the sober&#45;minded will not hatch therein the serpent which<lb/></p>

I believe that if our religion had prescribed<lb/> a law attended with half as much suffering as the baneful passion<lb/> of hatred inflicts&#44; we would disregard it as too onerous&#59; why should<lb/> we then contravene a precept intended to avert from us harrowing<lb/> pains&#63;  My brother&#33; my sister&#33;&#44; whatever be thy grievances&#44;<lb/> whatever be the insult thou wast made to endure&#44; if thou valuest<lb/> the peace of thy mind&#44; keep the Lord&#39;s command &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Hate not thy brother in thy heart&#34; By But a part of from any per&#45;<lb/>&#45;sonal consideration&#59; let me ask&#44; whether it becomes frail and<lb/> erring mortals to hold resentment and bear animosity&#33;  Will<lb/> you point out to me one&#44; whose conduct is so irreproachable&#44;<lb/> that it has never given cause for censure&#63;  If there is so<lb/> pure an individual among my audience&#44; let me him come forward&#44;<lb/> he shall be our preceptor and exemplar&#59; but if each of<lb/> us&#44; on the contrary&#44; hears at the very moment the voice of conscience that upbraids<lb/></p>

            <p>But I am not ignorant of the pretext adduced by the<lb/> vindictive for the committal of their reprehensible actions.<lb/>  They assert that their reputation would suffer&#44; if an<lb/> indignity offered thereto were to go unresented&#58; That to<lb/> overlook it&#44; would be giving room for misconstruction&#44; that<lb/> it might be regarded as an evidence of a cravens spirit&#44; as a<lb/> want of self&#45;respect.

            <p>But the wise teacher&#44; whose words I have chosen for my<lb/> text&#44; affirms that just such ones will obtain the remission<lb/> of their sins against God.  Furthermore&#44; when I open the<lb/> volume of truth&#44; I read that &#34;it is an honor for man to forbear<lb/> from strife&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; that &#34;it is a glory unto him to<lb/> pass over a transgression&#34; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Again&#58; I<lb/> learn from the same pure source that individuals greater and<lb/> nobler than we are&#44; exercised the law of forgiveness and it<lb/> was not imputed considered any derogation of their high&#45;character.<lb/>  Who&#44; for example instance&#44; has ever dared to say that the patriarch&#44; who&#44;<lb/> not alone pardoned those that had both injured his possessions&#44;<lb/> and banished him from their land&#44; but hospitably entertained<lb/> them at a sumptuous banquet&#44; was mean&#45;spirited and<lb/> <sic>pusilanomous</sic>&#63;  And Joseph&#45;&#45;that glorious specimen of<lb/> human virtue&#45;&#45;did he betray a feeble mind&#44; when to<lb/> the appeal of his self&#45;condemned brothers&#44; responded with<lb/></p>
