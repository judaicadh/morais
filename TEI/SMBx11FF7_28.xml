            <p>A funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>My friends&#33; Four Three score years and ten&#44; is the time<lb/> allotted to man in this transitory life.  Happy will<lb/> he be&#44; in the life of eternity&#44; whose deeds upon<lb/> earth were prompted by righteous motives.  For&#44; that<lb/> constitutes what is mainly required at our hands.<lb/>  Our judgments are fallible.  We often form<lb/> erroneous conceptions&#59; but if at the tribunal of<lb/> the Most High&#44; our actions can testify to the our<lb/> honesty of purpose&#44; we shall&#44; under Providence&#44; be<lb/> saved.  It is when a <sic>wilfully</sic> perverted mind<lb/> incites to iniquity&#44; when our reasoning faculties<lb/> minister to lust and avarice&#44; that every day added<lb/> to our existence here below&#44; is a curse ready to<lb/> be hurled against our soul&#44; when summoned above.<lb/>  Verily I say unto you&#44; an abortion is better than<lb/> he who did so long misapply the gifts of nature<lb/> and of God.  Now&#44; my dear hearers&#33;<lb/>  Did I believe that Joseph Andrade reached an<lb/> advanced old age for his spiritual unhappiness&#44;<lb/> I would keep perfectly silent.  For&#44; how should<lb/> I&#44; a perishable and corruptible creature&#44; dare to<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>pronounce my brother&#39;s doom&#63;  No&#44; let no mortal<lb/> being arrogate to himself a power which belongs solely<lb/> to the immortal God.  But I speak&#44; because I<lb/> believe conceive&#44; that what seems irreconcilable with propriety<lb/> in the life of our deceased coreligionist&#44; is capable&#44;<lb/> if correct&#44; of an interpretation which&#44; if it be correct&#44; would reflect on creditable to his character&#44; and<lb/> prove beneficial to his soul.  Born of a pious<lb/> father&#44; who occupied the exercised Rabbinical chair on an functions&#44;<lb/> ancient congregation&#44; our fellow&#45;believer learnt from<lb/> his earliest childhood that among the virtues&#44; whose practice<lb/> is recommended by the Jewish religion&#44; charity ranks fore&#45;<lb/>&#45;most.  And to the performance of that virtue&#44;<lb/> I imagine he may have bent his whole mind.  For it he advi&#45;<lb/>&#45;sedly underwent numerous privations&#59; for it he uniform&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly followed a line of conduct&#44; which the world must<lb/> needs have censured&#44; because&#44; to all appearances&#44; parsi&#45;<lb/>&#45;monious in the extreme.  That he might have<lb/> combined with charity&#44; the comforts of home&#59; the delights<lb/> of family ties&#44; is undoubtedly true&#59; but I imagine that<lb/> the precept of our religion&#44; to which he had become a<lb/> votary&#44; controlled all his deeds&#44; and led him to deny<lb/> himself what he should have endeavoured to enjoy<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>and share with others.  I will not believe that<lb/> &#91;&#63;&#93; impelled him so to act.  He who on one<lb/> occasion&#44; refused a munificent bequest&#44; lest it should<lb/> e said that he had grown opulent through another man&#39;s<lb/> exertions&#44; could not possibly be influenced by that baleful vice.<lb/>  I will rather ascribe his peculiar demeanour&#44; to the pos&#45;<lb/>&#45;session of a noble&#44; though eccentric virtue.<lb/></p>
            <p>Some of his charitable deeds were judiciously bestowed publicly known &#38; extolled&#44; while<lb/> he lived&#44; but he probably intended his last will&#44; as<lb/> a manifestation of the principle that had guided him<lb/> through life.  Friends of Joseph An&#45;<lb/>&#45;drade&#33;  In the name of suffering humanity&#59; in the<lb/> name of orphans and widows&#44; in the name of the needy<lb/> and the sick&#44; for the sake of those who lack instruction<lb/> in religion and in morals&#59; for the sake of the thousands<lb/> to whom his acquired wealth might have proved a bles&#45;<lb/>&#45;sing&#44; I now beseech you.  Exercise your influence with<lb/> the heirs of the deceased&#44; that his righteous intentions<lb/> may not be frustrated.  Describe to them the cha&#45;<lb/>&#45;racter of the institutions&#44; which the Hebrews of Philadel&#45;<lb/>&#45;phia support.  Tell them that their relative&#44; who<lb/> unhappily&#44; through some inexplicable motive&#44; died intestate&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>had already shown himself a patron of some of them&#44;<lb/> and had promised his favor to others.  Say to them&#44;<lb/> that the ancient Congregation&#44; in whose burial&#45;ground<lb/> his mortal remains are deposited&#44; had hopefully looked<lb/> to him for a recognition of its claims upon all the<lb/> faithful.  Oh&#33; strive endeavour with all the earnestness of<lb/> your souls that the hapless and the necessitous<lb/> mid in the community where Joseph Andrade spent<lb/> the best part of his existence&#44; and where he gathered<lb/> riches&#44; may have occasion to revere his memory as that of their benefactor.<lb/>  Could the lips now sealed in death&#44; speak open&#44; you<lb/> would see them move to join in my ardent entreaty.<lb/>  Respected friends&#33;  You may yet&#44; plead successfully for<lb/> the cause of charity.  You may yet do justice to<lb/> the poor of our city&#44; &#38; thus gain the gratitude of generations<lb/> yet unborn&#59; a lasting reward from our Universal<lb/> Father&#44; and obtain likewise the approval of the<lb/> now sainted man&#44; the aim of whose life&#44; you will<lb/> have been instrumental to carry into action.  Strive&#44;<lb/> my friends&#44; strive with all might&#44; and the blessing of the<lb/> Lord will attend your exertions.<lb/></p>
