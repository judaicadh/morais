            <p>a funeral oration<lb/></p>
            <p>The laws by which we are guided&#44; will not suffer me to give<lb/> utterance to mournful thoughts.  In like manner as the<lb/> practices to be observed on this melancholy occasion&#44; are sus&#45;<lb/>&#45;pended by reason of our festivals&#44; so are public expressions<lb/> of grief&#44; deemed incompatible with the celebration of a season&#44;<lb/> set apart by the Deity for devotional joy.  I will not<lb/> then lament the dead.  But I may comfort&#44; I may in&#45;<lb/>&#45;struct the living.  I may seize the opportunity&#44; to show<lb/> how infallible are the declarations of the book of books.<lb/>  Have you&#44; my dear hearers&#33; ever pondered on the words of the<lb/> Psalmist&#44; which commend a wisely directed charity&#63;  They<lb/> read so&#58; &#8220;Blessed is he that considereth the poor&#59; the Lord<lb/> will deliver him in time of trouble.  The Lord will preserve<lb/> him&#44; and keep him alive&#44; and he shall be happy on earth.<lb/>  The Lord will sustain him on the bed of sickness.&#8221;  My<lb/> friends&#33; that heavenly promise has had among us a living witness<lb/> of its truth.  We saw him and wondered that at three<lb/> score years and ten years of his age&#44; he should experience none of the ills<lb/> to which human flesh is heir.  We saw him&#44; and upon a<lb/> countenance scarcely furrowed by the hand of time&#44; discovered<lb/> the index of a contented mind.  We saw him also<lb/></p>

            <p>when approaching the end of his terrestrial journey&#44; and mar&#45;<lb/>&#45;velled that a disease&#44; which has proved to others a smouldering<lb/> fire&#44; wherein their vitals were consumed&#44; touched him but<lb/> slightly&#44; and spared his mortal frame the agony of a slow<lb/> dissolution.  Aye&#58; Apart from the circumstance which<lb/> prevents it&#44; I could not now bewail and moan.  For Marcus<lb/> Cauffman lived to illustrate the verities of Holy Writ.<lb/>  In him were fulfilled the blessings which attend a rightly<lb/> bestowed beneficence.  My Brethren&#33; When I<lb/> speak thus&#44; I have no reference to the numberless acts of<lb/> kindness he performed&#44; as a trusty officer of a charitable institution.<lb/>  Nor do I allude to the response he readily made to my ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;peals for the relief of the needy&#44; or for the upholding of<lb/> the sacred house edifice in which he offered poured forth his devotions prayers.  Those<lb/> tokens of righteousness were doubtless deserving of God&#39;s re&#45;<lb/>compense&#44; and our departed friend abstained enjoyed a portion thereof<lb/> even upon earth.  But the deeds which signally drew<lb/> towards him the favor of his Creator&#44; were of a still higher nobler<lb/> nature.  He considered how could his beneficence be<lb/> most effectually bestowed dispensed.  And he became the benefactor&#59;<lb/> the father of both relatives and strangers.  He had<lb/> centred his affection in b his wife&#59; but in the absence<lb/></p>

            <p>of children any offspring of his own&#44; he labored strenuously with his life<lb/> copartner&#44; to forward the happiness of beings&#44; to whom<lb/> he generously with great generosity he with great gener offered a delightful home.  His bene&#45;<lb/>&#45;volence was not the creation of a monetary impulse.<lb/>  Steadily it was proferred&#44; and constantly it was re&#45;<lb/>&#45;newed.  Therefore did the Lord of charity reward<lb/> him with health&#44; with competency&#44; with a mind un&#45;<lb/>&#45;muffled by perturbing thoughts&#59; with a heart replete<lb/> with satisfaction.  For he Marcus Cauffman enjoyed existence&#44; not<lb/> alone because he knew that he had performed goodly kindly by acting kindly&#44; He he did what is pleasing to God&#44; when<lb/> actions&#44; but because he was also made to feel that those<lb/> he had benefitted&#44; were bound to him with ties of the deepest<lb/> gratitude.  His parent&#45;like tenderness&#44; elicited feelings engendered sentiments<lb/> not surpassed by filial love.  Brethren&#33; At<lb/> no period&#44; should the voice of lament be lifted up for<lb/> the decease of one so divinely favored&#59; of one whose sins charity has redeemed.  We ought<lb/> rather to pray that we may become his equal in the<lb/> sight of the Lord.  We ought rather to seek w that<lb/> when our spirit shall&#44; like his&#44; take its flight above&#44;<lb/> it may be ushered into the presence of the great<lb/> King&#44; by so &#91;&#63;&#93; a record of so many deeds of goodness<lb/> of and beneficence.  For&#44; the same book&#44; which<lb/></p>

When thou<lb/> seest the naked&#44; cover him&#44; and hide not thyself from<lb/> thine own flesh.  Then shall thy light break forth<lb/> as the morning dawn&#44; and thy &#40;spiritual&#41; health spring<lb/> forth speedily&#59; thy righteousness shall walk<lb/> before thee&#59; the glory of the Lord shall be thy<lb/> <sic>re</sic> reward.&#8221;  Let us then carry to yonder grave<lb/> that which is perishable of our friend.  The memory<lb/> of his kindness shall remain with us &#38; be our exemplar&#59; for&#44; it will always<lb/> live. with us Like the aroma exhaling from the plants of a Paradise&#44;<lb/> will the good name be left&#44; be grateful to those who<lb/> he loved here below&#59; while his soul shall delight amid Seraphim<lb/> and Cherubim in the realms of eternity.<lb/></p>
