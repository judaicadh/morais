            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Why hast Thou O god&#33; laid this burden on Thy sluggish servant&#63;<lb/>  Why have I been chosen a steward of Thy house&#44; I incapable<lb/> of supplying Thy children&#39;s spiritual wants&#63;  Lo&#33; when I<lb/> should abundantly give&#59; when I should dispense the treasures&#44;<lb/> which the human soul yearns after&#44; I am totally unprovided&#44;<lb/> utterly destitute of the means whereby to offer the filling unfortunate support.<lb/>  But what I cannot accomplish&#44; Thou wilt do bring to pass O compassionate<lb/> Lord.  I have but a stream of tears for these sorrow&#45;stricken<lb/> parents.  Thou wilt send&#44; Oh yes Thou wilt a flood of light&#44; which&#44; irradiating<lb/> their minds&#44; they may discover disclose to them the justice of Thy dealings&#44;<lb/> even amid this the severest of trials&#44; and they be restored to serenity.<lb/>  Who more than these disconsolate beings&#44; stand in need of divine<lb/> help&#44; O consoler of the afflicted&#63;  In the appalling calamity<lb/> which had befallen the one&#59; in the sad bereavement which the<lb/> other enf sustained&#44; a bright face upturned towards them with<lb/> fulness of love&#44; infused into the heart calm and resignation.<lb/>  The child long prayed for&#44; the only child whom Sarah Thy<lb/> hand&#45;maid bore to her beloved husband&#44; chased away with<lb/> his innocent radiant smiles the clouds lowering on the horizon.<lb/>  His voice was melody to the ears of the fondest of fathers.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>His soft caresses enraptured the loving mother.<lb/>  Thou to whom our most recondite thoughts are revealed&#44; knowest<lb/> the plans prearranged for the training of that cherished son.<lb/>  They upon whom Thou hadst bestowed a precious gift&#44; sought<lb/> to evince gratitude by devoting the same to a noble end.<lb/>  But now Alas&#33; the cup of delights has been dashed from<lb/> the lips which had but sipped of its sweetness.  The hopes<lb/> that had gladdened the existence of these parents&#44; lie buried in<lb/> this small coffin&#44; soon to be consigned to the cold earth.<lb/>  Cast down&#44; filled with unspeakable anguish&#44; they approach<lb/> Thy throne in this fearful hour&#44; before the object of their<lb/> deepest affection be for ever removed from their presence.<lb/>  They return to Thee&#44; O Creator of life&#44; what Thou hadst volunta&#45;<lb/>&#45;rily given.  They had believed that theirs would have been<lb/> the happy lot of watching the growth of their dear<lb/> Herbert&#59; that they would have fostered the development<lb/> of his mind&#44; enriched human society with a member that<lb/> might labor for its progress&#44; supplied Judaism with<lb/> a staunch defender.  But Thou who hast said &#34;all souls<lb/> are mine&#34; didst decree that the supreme enjoyment<lb/> of these parents should soon die away.  They write<lb/> under the stroke&#44; yet&#44; they murmur not.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>It were superhuman not to weep&#44; not to utter<lb/> a cry of lament&#44; when the fibres of our hearts are<lb/> very nigh snapped asunder.  Thou does not require<lb/> it at the hands of finite&#44; frail creatures.<lb/>  But they&#44; whom Thou hast&#44; for some wise&#44; though<lb/> inscrutable design&#44; sorely bereaved&#44; look up prayfully<lb/> to heaven&#44; whence their help may come.  Oh let<lb/> it descend upon thy inconsolable suppliants.  Deliver<lb/> them form the misery which oppresses their minds.  Sustain Strengthen them&#44; that they may<lb/> not succumb beneath the weight of this crushing<lb/> sorrow.  Show unto them the path&#44; wherein they<lb/> may find solace&#44; even&#44; the way of piety and beneficence.<lb/>  Let them feel how lighter their misfortune grief suffering will appear become<lb/> in proportion as they will lessen the tribulations of their<lb/> fellow&#45;mortals.  May the memory of the little cherub&#44;<lb/> that has taken his flight above heavenward&#44; be the agency of<lb/> righteousness.  May it prompt to deeds of active sym&#45;<lb/>pathy and philanthropy.  May these afflicted parents<lb/> strive to perpetuate their names better than by<lb/> the means of human flesh.  Let them perpetuate<lb/> their names by caring for those whose infancy is not<lb/> as happy as that of their departed lamented son had been rendered.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Let them perpetuate their names by becoming<lb/> a father to the fallen&#44; a mother to the forlorn.<lb/>  By assuaging alleviating the grief distress of the orphans&#44; and being by rising as<lb/> the sustaining hopes of the widows.  Then will they<lb/> experience of whilst here below a foretaste of that bliss&#44; whose perfect<lb/> enjoyment will be our their crown&#44; who in the land of<lb/> spirits&#44; where a reunion with the beloved dead<lb/> will no more be exposed to the pangs of a<lb/> separation.  Amen.<lb/></p>
