            <p>Rev Dr S. Morais<lb/>
                Philadelphia  Pa<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Dr<lb/></p>
            <p>Your favor of the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ult was gladly received&#44; and in<lb/> reply I would say&#44; that as by your expression&#44; you may be able to<lb/> Decipher the uncertain word&#44; by seeing the Shekel&#44; I accordingly<lb/> send you one &#40;by the United State Express Co I have remold from<lb/> the one I have in my possession over 42 years&#59; and had cast of<lb/> a compound metal&#44; so that you may be able to Judge on <hi rend="underline">this</hi><lb/> one&#44; whether the genuine shekel from which mine was remold<lb/> in Jerusalem &#40;I have been told so&#41; is a true genuine&#44; by your<lb/> investigation&#44; or it is an Invention&#44; &#40;I cannot Imagine that<lb/> Mr Solomon would deceive me&#44; being a very respectable young<lb/> man&#44; and of letters&#44; having wealthy parents in Jerusalem&#44; and<lb/> he came by the advise of the late Sir Moses Montefior to learn<lb/> the trade of Engraving in London&#44; he married a Daughter of<lb/> Rev. Meldola of the <sic>Portuguess</sic> Congregation&#44;&#41; I cannot think<lb/> any other explanation&#44; than as you divide the word in<lb/> two sentence&#44; That the word &#91;Hebrew&#93; can be interpreting either<lb/> Left Deposited&#44; or Stored&#44; and as &#91;Hebrew&#93; is from &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> in &#34;&#91;Hebrew&#93;. locked&#44; or from Talmud &#34;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; it may be the vowel &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>in the Shekel is <sic>omited</sic> and is only a &#91;Hebrew&#93; as we find in<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93; many letters &#91;Hebrew&#93; and &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; so in the Shekel the &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> may be &#91;Hebrew&#93; and only a &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; as for instance&#44; we find in all the<lb/> Bible &#91;Hebrew&#93; but in our daily prayer is &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44;<lb/> I remember that <sic>somthing</sic> was said on that word when he<lb/> gave me&#44; but not handling all the time I have forgotten&#44;<lb/> and now as you having the Shekel before you&#44; you can Judge.<lb/>  And allow me to take the liberty to offer you this Shekel for<lb/> keepsake as a token of my high regard I have for you &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;<lb/> I was much pleased when I read in the Exponent of your recovery<lb/> of late sickness you had&#44; and hope the Almighty will prolong thy<lb/> days and to remain the shepherd of His flock&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>I was very much pleased to receive from you a few words of<lb/> congratulation of my being still among the living&#44; although<lb/> I have reached by the mercy of God to be over 80 years of age<lb/> which is the Period of the decline of strength &#40;<sic>accordin</sic> to our Rabbis&#41;<lb/> yet&#44; thank God I can say &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41; and although I<lb/> do not follow my profession&#44; yet I cannot be Idle and<lb/> whenever I have a chance to do some good for a community<lb/> I do it gratefully&#44; bearing in mind &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41;<lb/> and while being in Denver in 91 I got for the Jewish<lb/> Publication Society 90 members and here also 27 members<lb/></p>

            <p>Having a comfortable home with my son in law Mr Myers<lb/> who takes care of me&#44; so I can spare my time for the<lb/> welfare of others&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>In closing I beg to excuse me for this long letter<lb/> thinking that you may adapt the four rules of the<lb/> Wise men &#40;&#91;Hebrew&#93;&#41; &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Remaining yours very truly<lb/> H J Hyams<lb/></p>
            <p>PS<lb/></p>
            <p>After you deciding the merit or Demerit of that Shekel<lb/> you will please to send me a correct translation of it<lb/> as I intend to put one in the Library museum&#44; I would like<lb/> also to know the meaning of one side &#91;Hebrew&#93; and the other &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> It appears to me it meant Davids&#95;Shekel and Second&#95;Year<lb/> but in Hebrew the ש ought to be on the right hand side it would<lb/> read better &#91;Hebrew&#93; IT is my opinion that Hebrew<lb/> at that Period was not so <sic>grammaticly</sic> written as the<lb/> present time and that has given room for commentary&#44;<lb/> H.
