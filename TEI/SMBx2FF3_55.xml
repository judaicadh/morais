            Ladies and Gentlemen&#33;  After all that has been said<lb/> on this auspicious day&#44; the adding of some words from my<lb/> poor vocabulary&#44; would be&#44;&#45;&#45;to make use of a very inelegant<lb/> comparison&#45;&#45;&#44; like attempting to render a brilliant flame<lb/> still brighter by throwing therein a lucifer match.  But<lb/> you are to blame for having called upon me so ill&#45;pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;pared to speak fittingly and acceptably.  I shall&#44; how<lb/>&#45;ever&#44; screen myself from the shafts of your sharp cri&#45;<lb/>ticism behind the &#91;crossed&#45;out&#93; shield of brevity.  Several of you<lb/> may perhaps be not aware that I have already spoken<lb/> at some length this morning on the subject eloquently<lb/> and liberally expounded on yonder platform&#44; and&#45;permit<lb/> me to say without intending any &#91;&#63;&#93;dious distinction&#8212;specially<lb/> by our valued Christian friends the Honorable Horater Gates<lb/> Jones&#44; and Mr Charles S. Sheyser.  I shall not venture<lb/> therefore to repeat myself&#59; but since I am up&#44; <del>and</del> I will not<lb/> be seated without having given expression to few of the ideas<lb/> which the occasion suggested.<lb/>
                To you my brethren of the house of Israel I will say&#59; that I<lb/> have seen this day illustrated again the <sic>marvellous</sic> unity of<lb/>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            2<lb/>
            of our race.  Yes&#58; we are a unit&#8212;notwithstanding<lb/> ritual differences&#8212;in whatever involves principles and<lb/> vital ideas.  We are a unit in whatever pertains to<lb/> works of charity&#59; in what concerns our inalienable rights.<lb/>  We are a unit in claiming immunities warranted to all&#44;<lb/> in defending our faith from the aspersions of ignorant<lb/> and puny&#45;souled beings.  We are a unit in loving<lb/> freedom&#44; and in placing upon our heads as a diadem the<lb/> names of the immortal fathers of that Republic&#59; which has<lb/> opened an asylum for the oppressed&#44; by reason of opinion&#44;<lb/> and has proclaimed religious liberty.<lb/>
            Another thought&#44;&#45;&#45;and I ask your pardon for being selfish&#45;&#45;<lb/> is the circumstance that the distinguished sculptor&#44; my honored<lb/> friend Moses Ezekiel&#44; drew his inspiration from Italy&#44; the<lb/> land where the bones of my parents lie&#44; and whence I may&#44;<lb/> with pride&#44; tithe the land that develops poetry and artistic<lb/> genius.  From Rome specially he drew that inspiration&#44;<lb/> the Rome where our fathers dwelt from ages immemorial&#44;<lb/> and where they disseminated lore&#59; the Rome which<lb/> in the time of the Empire learnt what is good in Christianity<lb/> from Mosaism&#44; as &#91;&#63;&#93; records that pagans became<lb/> Judaized&#59; the Rome of the Popes&#44; where Israel found<lb/> a shelter to his weary feet&#44; when expelled from barbarous<lb/>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            3<lb/>
                Spain&#44; which does not to this day&#44; understand the<lb/> meaning of the word Liberty&#59; the Rome of the Popes<lb/> where our progenitors <del>became</del> were afterwards vilified and crashed&#44;<lb/> caged like <sic>raveous</sic> beasts within narrow and unhealthy limits&#59;<lb/> but now the Rome&#44; which has&#44; at last&#44; fulfilled the as&#45;<lb/>pirations of the best and greatest patriots from Dante<lb/> to Mazzini&#44; in becoming the metropolis of regenerated<lb/> Italy.  Now she has exchanged the badge of reproach<lb/> for that of honor.  Now she clothes her Hebrew children<lb/> with the insignia of power&#44; and sends them to the halls<lb/> of legislation&#44; to teach <del>wisdom to</del> the country of their birth<lb/> and love &#38; wisdom&#33;  It is my privilege&#44; Ladies and Gentlemen&#33;<lb/> to know some of those representative men of our race&#44;<lb/> and I can assure you that any communities may glory<lb/> in individuals so public&#45;spirited and liberal&#45;hearted.<lb/>  In that Rome it is then that our eminent sculptor<lb/> drew his inspiration&#44; in sight of that Vatican&#44; which<lb/> will yet become the <del>possession</del> property of its rightful owner&#44;<lb/> Victor Emanuel&#44; and will reveal a mine of rare knowledge<lb/> treasured therein and belonging to the sages of our people.<lb/>  May Moses Ezekiel acquire in that city and in the land<lb/> which gave the world a Buonarotti and a Carnova&#44;<lb/> renown and high celebrity&#44; an undying name reflecting<lb/>

            lustre on the faith of which he is a member&#44; and on the<lb/> country where he first saw the light of day&#59; even the<lb/> country of Religious Liberty<lb/>

            My dear Friend.<lb/>
            As you are about to leave us&#44; I wish that you carry with you<lb/> a very trifling memento of my esteem for yourself and family&#44; by the<lb/> accompanying speech made yesterday&#44; and of which you expressed a<lb/> desire to possess a copy.  I have endeavoured to recall it&#44; but I am<lb/> not certain that it is exactly as delivered.  The sentiments&#44; however&#44; are<lb/> the same&#44; though the wording may perhaps differ.  I may also have<lb/> left some of the ideas unrecorded&#44; and have placed others in their stead&#44;<lb/> but my head has been so full lately of literary matters&#44; that it is<lb/> difficult to keep all in in its entirety.  Reiterating my kindest<lb/> regards to your circle&#44; and sincere prayers for your son&#39;s brilliant<lb/> success in the liberal arts&#44; I remain<lb/>
            Yours very truly<lb/>
            S. Morais.<lb/></p>
