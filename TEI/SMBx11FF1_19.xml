            <p>For a Bar Mitzvah.<lb/></p>
            
            <p>In the beginning of summer&#44; the first month of which is now expiring&#44;<lb/> I promised that my brothers and sisters in faith&#44; who wish to keep up<lb/> the public worship at all seasons&#44; but still not to be detained incon&#45;<lb/>&#45;veniently to their health in Synagogue&#44; should be dismissed on the<lb/> Sabbath&#45;morning after a short prayer in the vernacular instead of<lb/> a discourse.  With one exception&#44; I have been unable to adhere to what<lb/> I intended fulfilling&#58; each week occasions having arisen&#44; which de&#45;<lb/>&#45;manded some remarks of greater or lesser length.  Today also&#44;<lb/> I must ask that you will bear with me awhile&#44; for&#44; I would not let<lb/> our young confirmant&#44; to use a modern term&#44; borrowed from our gentile<lb/> neighbors&#45;&#45;think that his application to our religious body is not<lb/> valued as much as that of others&#44; whom we have lately greeted.<lb/>  I am anxious&#44; on the contrary&#44; that he shall be really confirmed in<lb/> the opinion of the importance in which every accession to our<lb/> number is held&#44; and the glad anticipations formed&#44; when such as<lb/> he become qualified to be reckoned in the Congregation.  For&#44; I<lb/> believe that the natural dispositions of the ancestors are inoculated in<lb/> the blood running into the veins of their descendants.  So I interpret<lb/> the Biblical recommendation to parents to lead a virtuous and<lb/> religious life&#44; that God may show mercy to the thousandth ge&#45;<lb/>&#45;neration after them.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Now&#58; the grand&#45;sire of that lad was indisputably inclined to piety&#44;<lb/> and while he lived he felt it a pride to lead the yet unsteady steps<lb/> of his daughter&#39;s first&#45;born to the house of prayer.  To train the<lb/> child daily to bless the Lord for what he ate&#44; and for the sleep<lb/> he enjoyed&#44; was also the aged man&#39;s pleasure.  Well the<lb/> recollection of those earliest teachings&#44; always ineffaceable&#44; combine<lb/>d with the qualities inherited&#44; produce no beneficial results&#63;...<lb/>  But I rely mostly on home influence&#44; the means given us by<lb/> the Almighty to be directed to a righteous end.  I am aware of<lb/> the lamentable circumstance which acts everywhere like a<lb/> canker&#45;worm in the field of Judaism and threatens to devour<lb/> the branches and roots of the trees that should grow healthy<lb/> in the courts of our Lord.  I shall not allude to it this day&#44;<lb/> that I may avoid causing heart&#45;burnings&#44; while I desire to<lb/> promote joyfulness&#59; but I trust&#44; notwithstanding a draw&#45;back<lb/> infinitely to be deprecated&#44; that the influence of a parental abode<lb/> where harmony&#44; based on a sense of duty to one&#39;s children&#44; will<lb/> continue undisturbed&#44; where satisfaction with one&#39;s lot&#44; and<lb/> gratitude to Divine Providence shall be exhibited&#44; where&#44; I say&#44;<lb/> the mother will incessantly exemplify the principles of our faith<lb/> by industry and sobriety&#44; and the father by honesty and kind&#45;<lb/>&#45;ness&#44; will produce effects for which we may hereafter congratulate<lb/> the son of believing Israelites.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>I&#44; on my part&#44; am disposed to anticipate that issue&#44; and<lb/> therefore I address to you&#44; my young brother&#44; words of felicita&#45;<lb/>&#45;tion and encouragement.  When I say that you are fortunate<lb/> in possessing parents&#44; who spare not expense to have you in&#45;<lb/>&#45;structed in the way you should go&#44; I utter a truth&#44; which you<lb/> ought to feel&#44; and try to avail yourself of by seconding the<lb/> efforts made in your behalf.  But I must likewise urge<lb/> you to it&#44; and I would be remiss in my duty&#44; if I did not advise<lb/> you to bestow your whole thought upon what is imparted to<lb/> you&#44; so that it may be stamped on the mind.  By some lads<lb/> of your age&#44; studies are pursued as a mere compliance with pa&#45;<lb/>&#45;rental request&#44; as rather a favor conferred on their superiors&#44;<lb/> and not with a high purpose ever present and ever ennobling.<lb/>  I would that you study all things&#44; but specially the He&#45;<lb/>&#45;brew&#44; with the view of understanding how to live righteous&#45;<lb/>&#45;ly&#44; how to benefit others&#44; and as a Jew to be one among the<lb/> many&#44; through whom a revival&#44; or to speak more correctly&#44;<lb/> a foundation of a knowledge of our literature be established in<lb/> this country of your birth.  All cannot be gifted with<lb/> the same abilities&#59; you may&#44; perhaps&#44; have noticed with regret<lb/> that others have quicker parts.  But let me assure you&#44;<lb/> that it is not always the brightest&#44; who make the finest scholars&#59;<lb/></p>

            <p>they who labor with a determination to acquire knowledge<lb/> for a good object will surely succeed.  The Rabbis preach<lb/> patience and perseverance&#44; as the all&#45;conquering agencies&#44;<lb/> fully compensating for the ant of brilliant talents.  They<lb/> write &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;If a pupil exists to whom learning is as difficult as the bend&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing of iron&#44; let him still go on steadily.&#34;  May you gain this<lb/> steadfastness of purpose&#44; and grow wise&#44; but may you be<lb/> noted in your manhood for the practice of virtue more than<lb/> for your acquirements&#44; more loved for the qualities of the<lb/> heart than admired for the achievements of the mind.<lb/>  And let me pray that hose who have set their hopes on<lb/> your future may realize the sentence of Solomon&#44; that<lb/> the instruction of the father&#44; and the law of the mother&#44;<lb/> became an ornament of grace around your head&#44; and<lb/> a precious chain around your th neck.  So<lb/> may it be.  Amen.<lb/></p>
