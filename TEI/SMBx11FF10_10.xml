                <pb n="1"/>
            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>
                PHILADELPHIA&#44; PA.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Modestly lived our venerable sire&#44; therefore he earned<lb/> the reward which genuine modesty deserves&#45;&#45;the esteem<lb/> of a community in whose midst he very long and actively moved&#44;<lb/> and tokens of appreciation and of honor at the hands<lb/> of his fellow believers.  Solomon Gans ascended gra&#45;<lb/>&#45;dually from need to competence&#44; from competence<lb/> to affluence&#44; but there did not rise together in that<lb/> ascent&#44; the self&#45;assertion and assumption&#44; not infrequently the<lb/> attending of wealth.  To my knowledge&#44; the suc&#45;<lb/>&#45;cessful merchant&#44; never became guilty of the heinous<lb/> sin openly condemned by the archprophet of Israel.<lb/>  His lips were not heard thus to blaspheme&#58; &#34;What&#45;<lb/>&#45;soever I have <sic>ammassed</sic> is the fruit of my<lb/> unaided skill&#59; it is because my keen understand&#45; discernment<lb/> ing penetrated the future&#44; that I have retained my<lb/> riches.&#34;  No&#44; he recognized the benign Provi&#45;<lb/>&#45;dence that shapes our course&#44; through this earthly<lb/> career&#44; and his heart swelled with gratitude.<lb/>  Nor did the his inborn sentiments which governed his being&#44; lie<lb/> dormant at any time&#59; they sought out the means<lb/> to tangibly to prove their impelling force by deeds<lb/> of living kindness.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>But my speech is now unavoidably restrained.  Very many&#44;<lb/> if not all&#44; herein assembled&#44; knew well the natural<lb/> instincts of goodness&#44; which distinguished the cha&#45;<lb/>&#45;racter of our Solomon Gans.  Those to whom he<lb/> was a stranger&#44; our hoary headed brother in faith<lb/> would&#45;&#45;I am assured&#45;&#45;have preferred to keep<lb/> in ignorance of his manly virtues.  Notably he<lb/> shared the views I hold concerning post mortem<lb/> laudations.  He feared elegies panegyrics&#44; transcending the<lb/> limits of unimpeachable truth&#44; and he was<lb/> loth to have the funeral chamber converted into<lb/> a rostrum&#44; where the speaker may gratify<lb/> a prurient wish to display oratorical powers.<lb/>  Yet&#44; I dare not do my feelings violence by<lb/> remaining entirely silent.  I must tell<lb/> every one who has come to pay a last tribute of respect that I owe my venerable friend debts of gratitude.<lb/>  His confiding trust in me does call for thanks.<lb/>  The oldest member of the oldest Hebrew<lb/> Congregation in our Philadelphia&#44; he bore<lb/> with its unalterable ritualistic simplicity so suiting his disposition&#44; but which per&#45;<lb/>&#45;haps some may deprecate as the effect of<lb/> my idiosyncracy.  My departed friend did<lb/> not so consider it.  He never gave indications<lb/> of being annoyed therewith&#44; because for he<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>never withdrew his countenance and support from<lb/> the worship which I deem acceptable to Israel&#39;s<lb/> God.  Besides that evidence of his approval&#44;<lb/> which I deeply cherish&#44; he deigned to appreciate<lb/> my intentions&#44; when I sought an agency went in quest of a medium by which<lb/> to lend a fresh impulse and durable stability<lb/> to the principles of historical Judaism.<lb/></p>
            <p>If it be true that practical religions is the spi&#45;<lb/>&#45;ritual ladder on which the soul mounts up to<lb/> the serene regions of immortality&#44; then my vene&#45;<lb/>&#45;rable friend has already been already met by Seraphim<lb/> and Cherubim opening wide his path to beatitude.<lb/></p>
            <p>Farewell&#44; beloved fellow&#45;congregant of mine&#44; dia&#45;<lb/>&#45;demmed with the crown of senility.  The Lord<lb/> whom thou has served with humility with and an unsophis&#45;<lb/>&#45;ticated mind has showered down upon thee His blessings&#44; and<lb/> when a seat for thy endurable lasting joys was prepared&#44;<lb/> He vouchsafed to let in thee be fulfilled the<lb/> sentence of the good book&#58; &#34;Thou shalt come to<lb/> thy grave in a ripe old age&#44; like a shock of corn<lb/> which is brought in at its due season.&#34;  God of Israel our Fathers&#33;  May Thy<lb/> name&#44; O God&#33; be sanctified by the children &#38; children&#39;s children&#44; of Solmon<lb/> Gans and by their children&#39;s children even unto a late posterity for his long life<lb/> and the sweet death vouchsafed unto him. Thou didst grant Thy servant.  Amen.<lb/></p>
