            <p>A theory against which the Mosaic religion arose in direct<lb/> opposition&#44; because it is inimical to social order&#44; and human<lb/> happiness&#44; had followers among the contemporaries of the<lb/> arch&#45;prophet.  That Providence exists&#59; that the world<lb/> at large needs the guidance of a Supreme Wisdom&#44; unaf&#45;<lb/>&#45;fected by changes&#44; would be readily admitted&#59; but that the<lb/> great Being&#44; who rules the Universe in all its unmeasurable<lb/> vastness&#44; will take knowledge of the actions of each individual&#44;<lb/> and assign to every one&#44; a commensurate retribution&#44; would<lb/> be derived&#44; perchance&#44; secretly&#44; in those days&#44; if not like in ours&#44;<lb/> with open effrontery.

But it<lb/> is denied unto him who resolutely sins&#44; imagining<lb/> that nothing he does&#44; can be taken cognizance of by<lb/> the Omnipotent.  This idea he holds&#44; and which<lb/> Moses expresses by the phrase &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; &#34;adding <sic>drunk&#45;<lb/>&#45;eness</sic> to thirst&#34; that is&#44; filling up the measure of trans&#45;<lb/>&#45;gressions with deeds of determined wickedness&#44; this idea is<lb/> <sic>combatted</sic> against by the arch&#45;prophet&#44; because it bears<lb/> the seeds of social demoralization&#44; and universal corruption.<lb/>  Banish away the truth that the Almighty demands justice<lb/> and mercy in individuals as well as in nations&#59; that a<lb/> departure of from rectitude offends the all&#45;perfect Being&#44;<lb/> and calls down His displeasure&#59; banish away&#44; I say&#44; the<lb/> truth of our accountability to a Sovereign Judge here and<lb/> hereafter&#44; and you will have forged the engines with<lb/> which to work all iniquities.

            <p>servant of the Most High to be written.  It should<lb/> meet the eye which casts a longing look toward what<lb/> the rules of probity forbid&#44; and consume the passion<lb/> it seeks to gratify.  Aye&#58; &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;There is a<lb/> Judge and a Judgment&#44;&#34; and the man or woman who<lb/> rejects the fear of God to indulge in sin unchecked<lb/> and unrepented&#44; will not be spared in the day of wrath.<lb/>  This principle&#44; which underlies Judaism&#44; has been imparted<lb/> to us&#44; my dear hearers&#33; on the Sabbath&#44; which precedes<lb/> the expiring of one year&#44; and the rising of another&#44; <del>which</del><lb/> presenting itself beneath an impenetrable veil.  How<lb/> fitting it is that we should ponder of on that lesson&#44; how<lb/> essential&#44; that we should carry it with us&#44; on crossing<lb/> the threshold of a newly opened&#45;path&#44; which<lb/> we soon must tread.<lb/></p>
            <p>But what we have read this morning&#44; claims also<lb/> our special attention&#44; because it testifies to a <del>truth</del><lb/> belief once generally accepted in Israel&#44; but now<lb/> scouted&#44; as the offspring of ignorance.  Suppress<lb/> your smiles&#44; my hearers&#44; while I let Moses speak.<lb/>  &#34;The Lord thy God will return again to thee&#44; and have pity<lb/> on thee&#44; and gather thee again from among all the<lb/> people&#44; withersoever He has scattered thee&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>What vision is that which passes before the prophet<lb/> of old&#63;  His eye penetrated far into the unknown future.<lb/>  The tribes he has legislated for&#44; and led and loved&#44; breathe<lb/> no more a national life.  Broken limbs are they&#44; cast<lb/> to the four<del>s</del> winds.  Atoms in the boundless space.<lb/>  Was the vision false&#63;  Was it fiction that pictured the<lb/> resuscitation of dried bones&#63;  The wise of our age&#44; call<lb/> that expectation the most delusive of all hopes.  But<lb/> Moses declares that his people will plant again the<lb/> ensign of the Unity on Zion&#39;s heights.  &#34;If there be<lb/> driven away to the uttermost end of the heavens&#44; from thence<lb/> will the Lord thy God gather thee&#44; and from thence He will<lb/> fetch thee&#44; and bring thee&#44; to the land that thy fathers<lb/> inherited&#44; and thou shalt possess it&#44; and He will do thee<lb/> good more than He did thy fathers.&#34;  The arch&#45;prophet<lb/> stands surety for the <sic>fulfilment</sic> of that prediction.  To<lb/> doubt it&#44; is to impugn his w veracity&#44; to cast a<lb/> lasting slur on his whole legation.  For&#44; searching with<lb/> the light of history&#44; we perceive that the glorious promise<lb/> stamped indelibly on the pages we have perused this<lb/></p>

            <p><sic>this</sic> morning has never yet had a realization.<lb/>  The spirit of Judaism revived and purified&#44; did not exhibit<lb/> itself among the descendants of the redeemed exiles of<lb/> Babylon.  The banner of freedom&#44; symbol of order and<lb/> justice did not always waves then on the turrets<lb/> of Moriah&#39;s temple.  Partial&#44; and exceedingly<lb/> imperfect was the restoration of Judah&#39;s tribes from Chal&#45;<lb/>&#45;dea.  No&#58; the destiny of the Hebrew race lies in that<lb/> hidden future which the eye of one prophet peered into.<lb/>  It is not a merging into various nationalities&#59; not<lb/> a total absorption into other constituted bodies&#44; but<lb/> a resuming of a separate and self&#45;depending existence&#44;<lb/> with a wider scope and a loftier aim than the posses&#45;<lb/>&#45;sion of a tract of land&#59; with the design of testifying<lb/> to the truth of the scriptures&#44; and looming gloriously<lb/> high as a beacon of righteousness &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Israel says the Eternal&#44; is &#34;the branch of my planting&#44;<lb/> the work of my hands&#44; that I may be glorified&#34;.<lb/></p>
            <p>And this message sent form heaven to comfort Israel<lb/> in all their sufferings&#44; has come to us accompanied<lb/> with another&#44; from which it can never be <del>dij</del> disjoined.<lb/>  It concerns us always&#44; but remarkably at the present<lb/> season&#44; O fellow Israelites&#33; when we should prepare<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>for the judgment to go forth from the highest tri&#45;<lb/>&#45;bunal.  From that message we have learnt that<lb/> our actions are our mediator before God&#44; that a vicarious<lb/> sacrifice for the redemption of our souls&#44; is the laying<lb/> of our evil propensities on the altar of religious duties.<lb/>  Life and death&#44; we have been told&#44; are set before us.<lb/>  The choice rests altogether with our own free&#45;will.<lb/>  We may wend our steps where serene repose is offered&#59;<lb/> we may bend them towards a spot paved with sul&#45;<lb/>&#45;phur and brimstone.  But&#44; Oh divine mercy&#33; none<lb/> needs despair&#44; <del>bef</del> because he has been rushing headlong<lb/> in the way of perdition&#44; for if he so resolves&#44; he can<lb/> retrace his steps&#44; and gain the high road that leads<lb/> to a regenerating existence.  God has appointed his<lb/> ministering angels to usher us in from thence into his<lb/> presence.  The name of that road is &#34;Penitence.&#34;<lb/>  Do you now&#44; my Brethren&#44; wish to learn with precision<lb/> how Judaism defines the word penitence&#63;  Let me quote<lb/> <del>ag</del> from our Parasha.  &#34;The Lord thy God will rejoice<lb/> again over thee for good&#44; as He rejoiced over thy fathers&#44;<lb/> when thou wilt listen to the voice of the Lord thy God&#44; by<lb/> keeping His commandments and His statutes&#44; as<lb/> written in this book of the Law.&#34;<lb/></p>

            <p>Various in their characters are the ordinances contained<lb/> in the divine code.  It teems with moral precepts&#44; tending<lb/> to secure social order&#44; and further social happiness.  The Hebrews&#44;<lb/> like the rest of mankind&#44; are solemnly bound to observe<lb/> them.  A notation thereof might endanger the community&#44;<lb/> and provoke Him who abhors wickedness.  But the inspired<lb/> legislator set forth also ceremonial observance.  Upon<lb/> whom does their performance devolve&#63;  Upon me&#44; upon<lb/> you&#44; O congregation of Jacob.  &#34;Not with you alone&#44;&#34; says<lb/> the arch&#45;prophet &#34;I establish this covenant and this adju&#45;<lb/>&#45;ration&#44; but with him that is stands here with us to&#45;day&#44; and with<lb/> him also who is not with us to&#45;day.&#34;  None that is<lb/> born in Israel&#44; dares relinquish&#44; with impunity&#44; the mission<lb/> entrusted to him.  Each of us is &#91;Hebrew&#93; virtually<lb/> sworn to stand by the constitution accepted at <del>the foot</del><lb/> of Sinai.  Therefore&#44; penitence which&#44; when applied<lb/> to the actions of the followers of other creeds&#44; implies a sincere<lb/> return to the practice of moral laws&#44; governing the civilized<lb/> world&#44; signifies&#44; with regard to us&#44; a steadfast determi&#45;<lb/>nation to adhere to that which is consonant with reason&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="10"/>
            <p>and to that also which human reason cannot always<lb/> fathom.  For on that condition depends our propitiating<lb/> the favor of Israels&#39; God&#59; namely on &#34;keeping His command&#45;<lb/>ments and his statutes&#44; as written in the book of this Law.&#34;<lb/>  If we are unable to dive into the meaning of some&#44; we<lb/> cannot <del>nevertheless</del>&#44; fail to discover&#44; unless our judgments<lb/> are warped&#44; and our minds <sic>wilfully</sic> perverted&#44; that they<lb/> have served a high purpose&#59; that they have been<lb/> and they are <del>the</del> signs of the covenant <del>bef</del> between the<lb/> One God and his priestly people&#44; that they have proved<lb/> necessary barriers preventing too close an approximation<lb/> with those whose ideas of the Unity and all&#45;mightiness<lb/> of the Eternal clash with the ideas we have been com&#45;<lb/>&#45;missioned to perpetuate.  Whosoever inculcates the abro&#45;<lb/>&#45;gation of such statutes&#44; betrays contempt for Holy Writ&#44;<lb/> and a lamentable estrangement from the ancestral faith.<lb/>
                &#34;But&#44;&#34; say the advocates of a Judaism&#44; stripped of Jewish prac&#45;<lb/>&#45;tices&#44; &#34;the discharge of ceremonial precepts&#44; in this en&#45;<lb/>&#45;lightened age&#44; presents immense difficulties&#59; we cannot<lb/> carry out what hinders our free intercourse with all<lb/> our fellow&#45;beings.

Nay&#58; you<lb/> will discover that your habitual obedience&#44; has covered you<lb/> with a shield and buckler against the attacks of sons of<lb/> <del>blacker</del> a deeper hue than the violation of dietary laws&#44; that it has been an armor against vice.<lb/>  Nor will you sink&#44; as you fancied&#44; in the estimation<lb/> of your fellow&#45;creatures&#44; but rather rise and be honored.<lb/>  For they will justly argue that he who is faithful to<lb/> God&#44; will be honest with men&#44; charitable towards the<lb/> mortals&#44; kind and considerate towards all that draw<lb/> the breath of life.  Beloved hearers&#33;  Before another<lb/> year is greeted in the Jewish world&#44; let me elicit from<lb/> your lips the promise that you will cast behind whatever has<lb/> been defective in your conduct&#44; that you will carry with you<lb/> further on&#44; only what is correct&#44; and lawful and just&#44;<lb/></p>
