            <p>London&#44; England&#44;<lb/>
                January 2nd&#44; 1890.<lb/></p>
            <p>My dear Brother&#58;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>I drove over to Stepniak&#39;s yesterday.  Your<lb/> newspaper reports&#44; and reading your letter&#44; cheered him immensely.<lb/></p>
            <p>He is starting a paper to condense&#44; and systematically present<lb/> the current Russian story.  He will write you fully.<lb/></p>
            <p>His brother&#45;in&#45;law was seized and kept in prison four years&#44;<lb/> with no word of his family&#45;&#45;no court&#45;&#45;no trial&#45;&#45;and then<lb/> sent to Siberia&#44; where his wife joined him.  He knew not if she and<lb/> their child were alive till she came to him&#44; when he broke down in<lb/> hysterics.  The strain of no word for four years&#44; and then meeting&#44;<lb/> was <sic>to</sic> much for her&#44; and she is&#44; they fear&#44; doomed to die after the<lb/> reunion&#33;<lb/></p>
            <p>It is too harrowing even to hear about.<lb/>
                R. Pearsall Smith.<lb/></p>
                
            <p>13 Grove Gardens&#44; St. John&#39;s Wood&#44;<lb/>
                London&#44; England&#44;<lb/>
                January 15th&#44; 1890.<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Mr. Smith&#58;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>I was delighted with the visit of your brother&#44; Mr.<lb/> Pearsall Smith&#44; and with the good news he brought me from your part<lb/> of the world.  I am very glad to tell you&#44; that&#44; here in England&#44;<lb/> a similar society has been started&#44; headed by Dr. R. Spence Watson&#44;<lb/> of Newcastle&#44; one of the most influential men in the North of Eng&#45;<lb/>land&#44; and of which I hope you will hear before long.<lb/></p>
            <p>Quite recently I was told of another similar society projected<lb/> spontaneously by several leading men in London.  The thing is in<lb/> the air.  The public conscience of the civilized world is awakening<lb/> to the feeling that there are outrages against humanity&#44; against<lb/> which every human being has a right to protest.  This feeling is<lb/> <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> here&#44; but&#44; &#34;from what I hear&#44; it must be &#91;...&#93; <hi rend="underline">glowing</hi> in<lb/> your country&#59; and it seems to me that it rests with those who have<lb/> our cause particularly to heart&#44; to convert it into a new and per&#45;<lb/>manent factor in the struggle for Russia&#39;s freedom.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am too far away&#44; and I know too little of American life&#44; to<lb/> give you any practical suggestion.  The present movement of spirits<lb/> in favor of oppressed Russia has been rightly called &#34;Kennan&#39;s<lb/> Movement.&#34;  He has created it&#44; and he is quite the man to carry it<lb/> on&#44; and to direct it into a practical channel.<lb/></p>
            <p>I will only say that I fully agree&#44; and heartily sympathise&#44;<lb/> with what I understand to be the next step he advises to make&#58; In<lb/> the speech reported in the cutting you sent me he said he &#34;favored<lb/> making a fight for bringing to end the evils he&#34; had described&#44;<lb/> suggesting&#44; as the fittest weapon for this fight&#45;&#45;&#45;&#34;the founda&#45;<lb/>tion of a newspaper in London.&#34;<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Stepniak&#44; 2.<lb/></p>
            <p>I will frankly confess that&#44; to me&#44; it seems that &#34;making<lb/> fight&#34; is the very thing the Americans must look forward to if they<lb/> want the present great movement to bring great and permanent Re&#45;<lb/>sults.<lb/></p>
            <p>I do not&#44; for one moment&#44; admit the idea of any form of inter&#45;<lb/>ference in the fighting which is going on upon the Russian soil.<lb/>  There are responsibilities which foreigners cannot&#44; and have no<lb/> right to&#44; assume.  But&#44; the exercise of free&#45;speech is so unpre&#45;<lb/>scribable and pure&#44; in itself&#44; and the idea of freedom so undoubt&#45;<lb/>edly good and right&#44; and beneficial&#44; that no blame&#44; and no sort of<lb/> moral &#91;...&#93; responsibility can be attached to assisting<lb/> those who want to exercise that right&#44; and popularize these ideas.<lb/>  The joining hands with that section of the Russian patriots who<lb/> <hi rend="underline">without making any appeal to violence</hi><lb/> try to spread among their countrymen the ideas of freedom&#44; and<lb/> bringing home to these <sic>evuls</sic> and disgrace of the present despo&#45;<lb/>tism&#44; the Americans would be guilty of no encroachment upon the su&#45;<lb/>preme right of Russians to settle their own affairs.<lb/></p>
            <p>Such is my feeling upon the matter.  I do not know whether you<lb/> go so far&#44; or&#44; if you do&#44; whether you think it possible to carry<lb/> along with you the American public opinion.  In any case I would<lb/> strongly recommend to you not to narrow your work to the mere pro&#45;<lb/>test against the <hi rend="underline">ill treatment</hi> of political exiles.<lb/>  The great crime of the Russian Government is that there <hi rend="underline">are</hi> po&#45;<lb/>litical exiles&#44; men and women&#44; who have committed no offence what&#45;<lb/>ever&#44; who are only guilty of holding certain political opinions&#44;<lb/> and who are condemned&#44; without even the formality of a trial&#44; to<lb/> what is practically a slow death.  The outrages to which these per&#45;<lb/>sons are occasionally submitted are revolting&#44; and it is right and<lb/> good that you should protest against them with all the power of<lb/> your indignation.  But&#44; is it not more revolting still that these<lb/> hundreds and thousands of good and honest citizens should be put at<lb/> the mercy of these brutal gaelers and officials&#44; deprived of their<lb/> rights&#44; and condemned to a life of miseries&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>It is against the absence of any guaranty of personal freedom&#44;<lb/> security&#44; inviolability of domicile&#44; against the unbridled despot<lb/>ism of the irresponsible administration&#44; against the despotic sys&#45;<lb/>tem&#44; which is a disgrace to our country&#44; that the free Americans<lb/> ought to protest.<lb/></p>
            <p>There are many other things upon which I would like to speak<lb/> to you&#44; but it is not very convenient to converse at such a<lb/> distance.<lb/></p>
            <p>You tell me that I must come over to lecture in the States.  I<lb/> should like to&#44; but it is not so very easily arranged.  I am think&#45;<lb/>ing about it&#44; however&#44; and am lecturing here as often as I can af&#45;<lb/>ford&#44; to acquire the necessary practice.  I have written about the<lb/> costumes and album you have asked.  Hoping to hear from you&#44;<lb/> Yours&#44; very sincerely&#44;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Sergius Stepniak</hi>.<lb/></p>
