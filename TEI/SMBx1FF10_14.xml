            <p>London<lb/>
                13 Bevis&#91;&#63;&#93;<lb/>
                April 11th&#47;53<lb/>
                Dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>I now take my pen in hand to reply to your<lb/> letter of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ult.  I must commence by stating at once<lb/> that on the receipt of your letter I consulted with my<lb/> friends who&#44; as any one might expect&#44; advised me to accept<lb/> of your liberal offer.  I also consulted my chief friend&#44; my<lb/> parent.  She read your letter.  She did not reply directly<lb/> either in the negative or affirmative&#44; but said it would be<lb/> a difficult thing&#44; for me to leave her&#44; not having any one<lb/> to or any thing for her&#59; and with respect to your proposal<lb/> of sending for her after I had been settled in your coun<lb/>try&#44; <hi rend="underline">that</hi>&#44; she would not acquiesce in&#44; as she has said<lb/> she could never have the resolution to cross the seas<lb/> in her state of health&#44; being not a very favorable&#59;<lb/> hence to be brief I thought it was preferable to sacrifice my<lb/> interest for her sake and relenquish the idea of leaving her<lb/> for the present.  Having thus stated to you my inten<lb/>tions permit me to express to you my sincere<lb/> thanks for the offer you have made to me&#44; for the<lb/> trouble you have taken in endeavouring to pro&#45;<lb/>mote my interests&#44; you well knowing that the<lb/> prospects of those in my profession&#44; being here but<lb/> few and distant&#59; I assure you&#44; Sir&#44; that I could<lb/></p>
                
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>not have expected more kindness from any dearer<lb/> friend than you have shown towards me&#59; that I<lb/> cannot avail myself of it&#44; is clear by the cir&#45;<lb/>cumstances just explained.  How to repay you I know<lb/> not.  I only trust that you will accept the words<lb/> I with for the deeds.  I have endeavoured accord<lb/>ing to your respect&#44; to avoid mentioning your name<lb/> in the whole affair&#8212;Now for a few words concerning<lb/> general affairs.  The first thing I have to name to<lb/> you is sad&#44; one which I suppose you have heard of<lb/> by the demise of the Revd. D. Meldola&#44; which no doubt<lb/> will cause another change in Portuguese affairs&#44; Mr Hahn<lb/>on being now left the presiding &#91;Hebrew&#93; Dayan.  The Gentle<lb/>men of the Inahomad have resolved to establish a<lb/> branch Synagogue at the West End of the town&#59; but as they<lb/> transact their affairs in a very slow manner&#44; I<lb/> cannot write to you with any certainty until it<lb/> is finished.  They intend&#44; I believe testing a place<lb/> for three years&#59; furthermore I know not.  Our schools<lb/> are going on favorably but not doing any great<lb/> wonders.  The committee of the Orphans are educa<lb/>ting one of your pupils&#44; Nette&#44; in the Scholastic<lb/> profession.  They have sent him to the City of London<lb/> School for English and to Mr. Abrahams for Hebrew.<lb/>  The College appears to progress but slowly.  Concerning<lb/> the enquiries of Mr M. C. D. Azevedo&#44; I can inform him<lb/> myself&#44; without reference to Mr. Almosnino his<lb/> uncle Mr Aaron Cohen D. Azevedo died some time<lb/> since&#44; and his cousin Miss Reynas Hamson is still<lb/> alive and well&#44; one cousin of his has gone to<lb/> Australia.  I will send some of my books at the ear<lb/>liest opportunity.  I must now draw my letter to<lb/> a close&#44; again thanking you for your kindness&#44;<lb/> and wishing you long life and happiness&#44; and<lb/></p>
            <p>remain<lb/>
                Yours truly<lb/>
                Solomon Sebag<lb/></p>
