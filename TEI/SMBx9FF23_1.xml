            <p>For Parashat Kedoshim<lb/></p>
            <p>Sovereign Legislator&#33;  Thou givest the people of Israel<lb/> a code of moral laws&#44; which has become the text book of<lb/> civilized communities.  And verily&#33; in proportion<lb/> as these will heed the teachings therein contained&#44; so<lb/> will the standard of justice be heightened&#59; so will the<lb/> principles of humanity serve as a guide alike to<lb/> nations and to individuals.  The false idea of honor&#44;<lb/> which now arrays Thy children O Lord&#33; against each other<lb/> in mortal conflicts&#44; will be banished by the correct thought<lb/> that wars are but <sic>cooly</sic> premeditated murders.  The<lb/> bereaving sword will represent a relic of barbarism.<lb/>  A sport of forbearance&#44; a disposition to condede&#44; a<lb/> desire to adjust difficulties&#44; will further the best interests<lb/> of mankind.  Selfishness&#44; which stands at the basis<lb/> of earthly governments&#44; will disappear in the contemplation<lb/> of that government Divine&#44; whereby all created beings<lb/> receive life and sustenance.<lb/></p>
            <p>But grant O god&#33; that we&#45;&#45;the humble instruments of social<lb/> progress in Thy hand&#45;&#45;may act&#44; as if alive to the high<lb/> significance of the words directed whilom to our understanding.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Thou wouldst that we be holy&#44; which means that<lb/> we be devoted to Thy service.  Not by leading a purely<lb/> meditative life&#59; not by segregating ourselves from the<lb/> rest of the world&#44; but by <sic>developping</sic> our virtuous<lb/> instincts&#44; even while mixing with our fellow&#45;mortals<lb/> in their every day&#39;s concern.  For this are we to approach<lb/> perfection.  So we shall be holy&#44; as Thou O Lord our God<lb/> art holy.  Then parents in Israel will be refe&#45;<lb/>&#45;rentially spoken of&#44; and respectfully spoken to.<lb/>  The hoary head in our midst&#44; will elicit tokens of reverence&#59;<lb/> the young will secure kindly consideration.  Our<lb/> judge&#39;s ermines will remain unspotted.  Neither will<lb/> the riches of the wealthy prove to them a fortress of<lb/> defense&#44; nor will the poor find in their indigence a<lb/> screen for their dishonesty.  The laws restraining our<lb/> passions&#44; curbing our appetites&#44; the observance of which<lb/> is the only safeguard of the social compact&#44; will be adhered<lb/> to by each man and woman that is called a Hebrew.<lb/>  The love of our neighbor like that of ourselves&#44; will be exemplified<lb/> in our every deed&#44; in our address&#44; in our very motions regard&#45;<lb/>&#45;ing Thy creatures O Lord&#33; whom Thou hast endowed with an<lb/> immortal soul.  For&#44; Thou wouldst that none be<lb/></p>

            <p>excluded from that golden rule.  Therefore Thou didst inspire<lb/> Thy arch&#45;prophet to employ a term in framing that precept&#44;<lb/> whose interpretation &#91;inserted above&#58; meaning&#93; might admit of no<lb/> distinction&#59; As it is written &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Yet&#44; lest in the course of ages&#44; posterity might wrongly<lb/> construe what Thou willest that it might be deeply impressed upon<lb/> the mind of all sentient beings&#44; Thou didst strengthen<lb/> the sublime ordinance just cited&#44; by adding another&#44; which<lb/> enjoins upon us to love the stranger.  For we read &#34;Like a<lb/> native shall be the stranger among you&#44; Thou shalt love<lb/> him like thyself&#34;&#44; placing beyond a peradventure the<lb/> signification of the ennobling command&#44; that we must<lb/> evince feelings of kindliness&#44; of commiseration&#44; of friendship<lb/> to all the offspring of Adam&#44; irrespective of country&#44;<lb/> of color or of creed.  Oh&#33; that these soul&#45;elevating<lb/> principles were engrafted on the heart of mankind at<lb/> large.  We would not lament this Sabbath the sorrowful<lb/> tidings that have just reached come to our hearing&#59; even&#44; the effect<lb/> of deep&#45;rooted fanaticism on our hapless coreligionists<lb/> who dwell in iniquitous Roumania.  No casting<lb/> of venerable Rabbis&#44; and prominent Israelites in dungeons<lb/> like felons&#44; to appease prejudice and bigotry.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>How long O Lord&#33; how long shall the wicked triumph&#63;<lb/>  They speak&#44; they utter reproaches&#59; they oppress Thy<lb/> people&#44; and afflict Thy heritage.  They wrong<lb/> the widow&#44; and slay her of orphans.  Arise O<lb/> Lord&#33; uphold the hands of Thy servant Benjamin<lb/> Frank Peixotto that he may bring forth justice<lb/> to light&#44; even Thy judgments like noon&#45;day.<lb/>  Then will truth be vindicated&#44; and they who pine in<lb/> chains and solitude&#44; will exclaim in the language<lb/> of the ancient Psalmist.  &#34;Our soul has ex escaped like<lb/> a bird from the fowler&#39;s snare.  The snare has been<lb/> broken&#44; and we were saved.  For&#44; our help was the Lord<lb/> of heaven and earth&#44; whose name must be praised from<lb/> now to the end of time.&#34;  Amen.<lb/></p>
