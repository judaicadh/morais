            My dear sir.<lb/></p>
            <p>Your valued favour of the 16th<lb/> reached me&#44; the contents of which were read<lb/> with great pleasure&#44; the interest you have man&#45;<lb/>ifested in our Cincinnati projects are indeed<lb/> worthy of the highest consideration&#44; I can assure<lb/> you with all candour that the objects set forth<lb/> in our &#34;congregational union&#34; are <hi rend="underline">honest in pur&#45;<lb/> pose</hi> so far as they have professed&#44; all we want<lb/> now&#44; is to effect a <hi rend="underline">more perfect union</hi> in order<lb/> to carry out what is requisite&#44; I hope you<lb/> will see the necessity of endeavouring to<lb/> work for the &#34;Union&#34; you know the old motto<lb/> &#34;In Union there is <sic>strenght</sic>&#34; I have no doubt<lb/> that you will <sic>response favourable</sic> to the inter&#45;<lb/>rogatories I&#91;&#63;&#93; in the circular in the last<lb/> no. of the Israelite&#44; and probably one has been <lb/>sent to you&#44; and that you will urge your<lb/> congregation to become a member of the union<lb/> and send representatives to the next meeting in<lb/> July next&#44; and that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will be selected as one<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>as one of the delegates&#44; I am sure that you<lb/> will be pleased to pay us a visit&#44; and I am<lb/> sure it will be physically&#44; as well in a religious<lb/> point of view a benefit to you.  I know the<lb/> next convention will be composed of the same<lb/> stamp of men as the last a more determined and mag&#45;<lb/>nanimous body of Israelites never met on any<lb/> similar <sic>occassion</sic>&#44; your congregation will have<lb/> but little to enture&#44; and much to gain if the<lb/> cause is a good one&#44; if we want to promote<lb/> a good object it is of no use to keep aloof<lb/> they need not be bound to the &#34;union&#34; if it is<lb/> good&#44; remain&#44; if not&#44; withdraw&#44; the &#34;Beth Elo<lb/>him&#34; of Charleston S. C. have joined.  Now urge<lb/> the old &#34;Mickval Israel&#34; of Phila be the second<lb/> Portuguese congregation to join it then the barriers<lb/> of nationalities can e broken and uprooted for<lb/> ever&#44; it is not worth the experiment if I may<lb/> so term it&#63;   I want you to work for it.  I am<lb/> positive you will never have a cause of regret<lb/> I want you to come out here to pay us a visit<lb/> and see our people&#44; mix among them&#44; and see<lb/> if there is not as much devotion to our sac&#45;<lb/>red religion as you will find in any commu<lb/>nity&#44; you may profit by some interviews with<lb/> our <sic>Rabbies</sic>&#44; probably you and they may not<lb/> differ so much in the aggregate&#44; it will not do<lb/> to be too much biased by <sic>predjudice</sic>&#44; progress<lb/> cannot be retarded&#44; the world progresses it<lb/> is no use to lag behind the times&#44; the masses<lb/> will think&#44; and do their own thinking&#44; the time<lb/></p>

            <p>has pretty well past&#44; for us to allow others to do<lb/> our thinking.  We must take things <hi rend="underline">as they are</hi>.<lb/> in the religious world&#44; we find that we cannot<lb/> have them as we would wish&#44; and as we have<lb/> been trained.  Still we can be as <hi rend="underline">good</hi> as ever we<lb/> have been&#44; should we not think that these changes<lb/> in the minds of the people&#44; are the works of the<lb/> almighty for a good purpose.  You know there<lb/> was a time among us&#44; yes&#44; in my days that<lb/> the mention of the name of Jesus was considered<lb/> as a sacrilege to our faith.  We considered him<lb/> and his apostles as a myth.  Now do <del>not</del> not<lb/> our writers freely admit his <sic>existance</sic> &#38;<lb/> his acts&#44; see &#34;The Deicides&#44;&#34; have we neared Chris&#45;<lb/>tianity by the admission&#44; or have we not rather<lb/> <sic>strenghtend</sic> our cause by the free admission<lb/> of the truths.  I delivered your message to<lb/> Dr Wise and enclose you his reply&#44; do write<lb/> your views on matters of interest for the good<lb/> of our cause and what ought to be effected<lb/> by the union of congregations for the good of<lb/> Judaism&#44; and I know it will bear some weight&#44;<lb/> they will be published in the Israelite I hope<lb/> you and all are well&#44; give my love to dear<lb/> Nina tell her that I have not forgotten&#44; I owe her<lb/> a reply.  Mrs &#38; Mr &#91;&#63;&#93; and Mr Ezekiel<lb/> and every member of our family unites<lb/> in love to you and all&#44; to my dear sister<lb/> and family&#44; will be pleased to hear from<lb/> you soon again&#44; as ever&#44; I am truly yours<lb/></p>
