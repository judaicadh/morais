            <p>Brethren&#33;  Imagine that I were to inform you this<lb/> morning of the presence of an illustrious personage in<lb/> our midst&#59; of one whose fame resounds through the<lb/> habitable globe&#44; would you not study every motion&#44;<lb/> and evince by your outward demeanour&#44; the feelings you<lb/> experience inwardly&#63;  I know&#44; that I&#44; to create a favor&#45;<lb/>&#45;able impression would address him most respectfully&#44;<lb/> and employ the choicest language at my command.<lb/>  How immeasurably greater should be then our efforts<lb/> to preserve a reverential attitude&#44; when He who has<lb/> vouchsafed to grace our assembly&#44; is the most adorable of<lb/> Bungs&#59; the sovereign Creator of the world.  You<lb/> have heard the message He sent to Israel in the days of yore.<lb/>  &#91;Hebrew&#93;  &#34;Let them make me a sanctuary&#44;<lb/> that I may dwell among them&#34;.  That message&#44; my<lb/> fellow&#45;believers&#44; was manifestly designed for all generations.<lb/>  The priestly Seer who prophesied during the Babylonish<lb/> captivity wrote by inspiration.  &#34;Although I have removed<lb/> them far away among the nations&#44; and although I have scat&#45;<lb/>&#45;tered them among the countries&#44; yet will I be to them as a<lb/></p>

            <p>minor Sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.&#34;<lb/>  To divert our minds from the errors of gentilism&#44; God<lb/> would open a correspondence&#44; as it were&#44; between Him&#45;<lb/>&#45;self and his chosen people&#44; through the service He<lb/> desired they should tender unto Him.  History<lb/> does not relate how were our ancestors impressed by that<lb/> behest&#59; but a traditional legend tells of the unutterable<lb/> amazement it cause their righteous leader &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  &#34;Could a structure be raised equal in extent to<lb/> the pervading Spirit of the universe&#63;  Lo&#33; the highest<lb/> heavens cannot hold their sovereign Maker&#59; yet&#44; I am bid<lb/> to rear a place wherein God may abide.&#34;  So reasoned<lb/> the arch&#45;prophet.   But the heavenly voice which had<lb/> imparted the ordinance was heard to exclaim &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;Moses&#33; thou hast not rightly understood.&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#91;Hebrew&#93;  &#34;Twenty boards on the North side&#59;<lb/> twenty on the south&#44; and eight in the west will amply<lb/> suffice.&#34;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;  &#34;I will&#44; for men&#39;s<lb/> sake&#44; lower myself to their level&#44; and narrow down my<lb/> Divine essence&#34;.

What should be then the distinctionguishing<lb/> characteristics of that edifice&#63;  Its stately<lb/> appearance&#44; its collonade&#44; and gorgeous tapestry may<lb/> evidence a praiseworthy liberality&#44; but will be incapable<lb/> of drawing toward it a celestial influence.<lb/>
                Will the melody of ten thousand instruments attract<lb/> the Shekinah to the spot whence it reverberates&#63;<lb/>  No&#58; the nature of the place which the Deity will<lb/> irradiate with the light of His countenance&#44; must<lb/> be such that the term employed in the Hebrew text<lb/> may fitly apply thereto.  It must be a &#34;Mikdash&#34;<lb/>&#45;&#45;a dwelling of sanctity&#45;&#45;a spot where all the surround&#45;<lb/>&#45;ings bespeak the reverence it inspires&#59; where holy thoughts<lb/> are conceived&#44; and strengthened and enlarged.  Carved<lb/> timber and polished stones cannot be dedicated to the<lb/> Most High.  The hearts of men can and should be devoted<lb/> to His service.

So did the scripture teach&#44; when it gave<lb/> the edifice erected in the wilderness&#44; those two significant<lb/> appellations.  The sages of Israel however&#44; have<lb/> prescribed for our guidance certain rules by adhering to which&#44;<lb/> we would glorify here below Him that is enthroned above.<lb/>  I have had occasion frequently before to offer them to<lb/> your consideration.  But in perusing the same&#44; I lighted upon<lb/> one&#44; which especially arrested my attention.  It is that<lb/> which demands that we testify our respect for the house<lb/> of worship by our attire &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>I pondered thereon&#59; not because I discovered that we<lb/> disregarded that injunction&#44; but because we are apt to<lb/> transcend its limits.  As it generally happens&#44; a deviation<lb/> from the middle course&#44; has produced&#44; in this instance<lb/> also&#44; a baneful effect.  I asked a lad a reason<lb/> for his protracted absence from the synagogue.  He<lb/> assigned for it the want of better garments than those<lb/> he usually wore.  Brothers and sisters&#33;  I apprehend that the<lb/> habits we indulge into&#44; virtually exclude form this<lb/></p>

            <p>holy communion&#44; many of our coreligionists.  They who<lb/> cannot vie with the rich in their habiliment&#44; fail&#44;<lb/> for that motive&#44; to join in our public devotions.  Nay&#58;<lb/> the evil is obviously greater.  For&#44; some will only ap&#45;<lb/>&#45;pear&#44; when the elegance of their dress&#44; may elicit the<lb/> admiration of worldly beings&#44; whereas they ought to<lb/> be constantly in attendance to secure the approbation<lb/> of the heavenly King.  Humility we should<lb/> put on as a vesture&#44; simplicity of manners as the<lb/> girdle of our loins&#44; when prest we present ourselves<lb/> in the dwelling of the Lord.  Our brother in a lowly<lb/> condition of life&#44; seeing that&#44; would not be owed back<lb/> from the gates of prayer.  Not unsuitably has<lb/> the fan in which we pour forth united supplications<lb/> been called &#91;Hebrew&#93; or &#34;synagogue&#59;&#34; for&#44; therein ought<lb/> every one&#44; who adores the One living God&#44; to be gathered.<lb/>  Could the longing of my soul be fulfilled&#44; no difference<lb/> of ritual would exist to prevent a Hebrew from<lb/> mingling indiscriminately with his fellow&#45;believers<lb/> in devotional exercises.

            <p>the &#91;inserted above&#44; in pencil&#58; differences&#93; inequalities which elements&#44; foreign to our religion&#44;<lb/> have created.  The names by which various bodies of<lb/> <sic>of</sic> Jews are now distinguished&#44; would not be<lb/> written in the future annals of our people.  But<lb/> let us not&#44; at all events&#44; banish&#44; by our demeanour&#44;<lb/> any Israelite who voluntarily sits in our midst&#59; though<lb/> he be the humblest and the poorest.  Who more<lb/> than he can values the privilege&#44; to which our blessed<lb/> faith entitles him&#44; even that of singing hymns and<lb/> psalmodies with the most opulent or the most fortunate of God&#39;s children&#63;<lb/>  It is a comfort amid distress.  It is the means of infusing<lb/> contentment wit hone&#39;s lot&#59; it is the instrument by<lb/> which they are upheld in the path of rectitude&#44; whose<lb/> pressing wants would incite to prevarications.  For&#44; this<lb/> is a high school of morality&#59; this is the oracle of God&#44; giving in&#45;<lb/>&#45;struction and wise counsel.

            <p>Now&#44; without wishing to make any insidious remarks&#44;<lb/> I will say&#44; that I have observed with pain how many<lb/> among the attendants fail to participate in this religious<lb/> service.  It might seem&#44; as if they regarded the<lb/> officiating minister&#44; and the few who respond to his<lb/> invocations&#44; as invested with vicarious powers&#59; but our<lb/> prayers&#44; my dear friends&#44; are intensely national.<lb/>  Every one born in Israel must personally unite in ten&#45;<lb/>&#45;dering to the Redeemer and Protector of our race&#44; the honor<lb/> due to His name.

            <p>high&#45;priest of yore.  Let us understand it<lb/> once for all.  The service at the Synagogue<lb/> bears no analogy with that anciently held at<lb/> the Temple&#44; in the capital of Judia.  There&#44; the<lb/> blood of slaughtered animals atoned for sin&#59; there&#44;<lb/> the Levites choir&#44; accompanied with vocal and instru&#45;<lb/>&#45;mental music the rite of the sacrifice.  There few<lb/> Hebrews&#44; except the delegates people&#39;s representatives sent by the various sections<lb/> of the country to attend at the daily offerings&#44; bowed toward<lb/> the holy ark.  Thrice a year alone&#44; during the rural<lb/> festivals&#44; a pilgrimage was made by the male population to the shrine sancti&#45; of the<lb/> &#45;fied by the Divinity Cherubim &#38; the golden altar.  But the synagogue has<lb/> been from a remote period to within the mid half first part of<lb/> this century&#44; the center to which the faithful const&#45;<lb/>&#45;antly directed their steps&#44; and where in godly simplicity<lb/> they prayed and edified one another.  Brethren&#33;  Let us preserve<lb/> ours as such.  Let the fathers bid their sons rehearse<lb/> the national supplications.  Let the mothers encourage<lb/> their daughters to blend their voices harmoniously<lb/> in our national anthems.  Let rich and poor&#44;<lb/> young and old throng this mansion of sanctity&#44; and<lb/></p>

            <p>prove the feelings that actuates them by a decorous&#44;<lb/> devout and humble demeanour.  Then we shall<lb/> have made a &#34;Mikdash&#34; and the Sehkinah will<lb/> rest thereupon &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/></p>
            <p>But the reverence we pay evince toward the synagogue&#44; is equally<lb/> due to another spot.  To that from which sacred religious learning<lb/> is disseminated.  Nay&#58; according to our Sages&#44; it exceeds<lb/> the former in sanctity &#91;Hebrew&#93; For&#44; that is the laboratory<lb/> of the mind&#44; and thence will issue forth those&#44; whose<lb/> enlightened zeal shall will perpetuate Judaism in its<lb/> purity integrity.  But many among you&#44; are ignorant<lb/> of even the existence of such an establishment in our<lb/> midst.  Few are aware that men prompted by<lb/> the purest motive&#45;&#45;by the love of Hebrew nationality&#45;&#45;devote<lb/> a portion of their time each day to rear youths to the<lb/> ministry.  I myself would not&#44; in all likelihood&#44; have<lb/> now alluded to it&#44; but for an occurrence which happened<lb/> this sabbath.  A lad was recently sent<lb/> hither from a neighboring city.  He had been the<lb/> inmate of an orphan asylum&#59; and the directors of<lb/> that benevolent Institution&#44; seeing in him a disposition<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>and aptitude to learn&#44; assumed his support&#44;<lb/> until he be enabled&#44; by the knowledge acquired&#44; to<lb/> provide for his own subsistence.  The lad is he that recited<lb/> before you a portion of the Torah.  Of an age&#44; which<lb/> scarcely warrants his occupying a seat at a college&#44;<lb/> he nevertheless receives there&#44; instruction in Biblical<lb/> lore.  To further his laudable aspirations&#44; and<lb/> reward his assiduity&#44; he is afforded a benefit&#44; which<lb/> many of his senior&#45;school&#45;mates do not enjoy.<lb/>  I dare not utter a prediction&#59; but I pray that<lb/> the lad may become a faithful expounder of the<lb/> book from which he has read in your presence.<lb/>
                My hopes for the future of Judaism&#44; rest&#44; firstly upon<lb/> God&#44; then upon the offspring of the needy&#44; and<lb/> on the fatherless.  The wealthy&#44; and the fortunate<lb/> exhibit no desire to cultivate the field of sacred literature&#44;<lb/> and much less to embrace a vocation&#44; which is&#44; at<lb/> best&#44; beset with difficulties.  But they who have<lb/> been&#44; from their tender age inured to hardships&#44; will<lb/> not reject a holy office&#44; because it does not&#44;<lb/></p>

You must&#44;<lb/> dear Brethren&#33; procure for yourselves trust&#45;worthy<lb/> teachers&#44; from those reared under your &#91;&#63;&#93; immediate supervision.
