            <p>Richmond December 18 1856<lb/>
                My Dear Mr Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>I thank you for the interest<lb/> you evinced&#44; and the friendly manner in<lb/> which you endeavored to retain Levys situation<lb/> for him&#44; and regret for the sake of all concerned<lb/> that you were not successful&#44; of course&#44; comment<lb/> from me&#44; on his conduct&#44; is unnecessary&#44;<lb/> you can imagine my feelings&#44; I can<lb/> only say&#44; that I duly appreciate that as well<lb/> as many other of your kindly actions&#44; towards<lb/> me and mine.<lb/></p>
            <p>I presume Clara has received<lb/> the slippers sent by Mr Hart&#44; do they fit<lb/> well&#44; and is she pleased with them.  I could<lb/> not suit myself in another pattern or should<lb/> have done so&#44; as she has seen that often<lb/> enough to be tired of it.<lb/></p>
            <p>Mr Jacobs received<lb/> the Asmonean&#44; is much pleased with the<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Asmonean thanks you for your attention and<lb/> desires kind regards.  I think I said before<lb/> that all here were highly pleased with your discourse.<lb/>  Levy is trying to obtain a situation in this city.<lb/>  All my friends seem anxious he should do so<lb/> should he succeed&#44; it would render me very<lb/> lonely at home&#44; but would evidently prove beneficial<lb/> to him at least&#44; until Mr Hyneman and himself<lb/> can better understand each other&#44; or the<lb/> asperity of their tempers are somewhat softened&#44;<lb/> which is most likely to be the result&#44; <del>of</del> after a separation<lb/> of some length of time.<lb/></p>
            <p>You are aware that Jacob<lb/> is with Mr Elly Goldsmit&#44; I am happy to say<lb/> they are mutually pleased&#44; but he is unwilling<lb/> to remain after I leave the city unless Levy stays<lb/> here.  The other boys are improving considerably<lb/> their weekly reports from school are very good.  I trust they<lb/> will continue as studious after we return home.<lb/></p>
            <p>Augustus expects<lb/> to read an Haphtorah in a few weeks&#44; that<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>however is not an evidence of improvement<lb/> as any child can be taught to rehearse of<lb/> few lines of <sic>hebrew</sic> in a few weeks.  I will permit<lb/> it however&#44; as an incitement to further progress.<lb/></p>
            <p>The excitement of<lb/> the wedding is over&#44; and all are settled down<lb/> again&#44; into the hum&#44; drum&#44; of every day life&#44;<lb/> but I should not be surprised at a revival<lb/> of dancing parties next week&#44; of which I cannot<lb/> be a very joyous participant&#44; as I feel more like<lb/> being at home after an absence of nearly two<lb/> months which seem like as many years<lb/> notwithstanding the enjoyment I have had&#44;<lb/> I am generally at home in my dreams however.<lb/></p>
            <p>There seems a strange<lb/> coincidence in our writers at the same time&#44;<lb/> which causes delay in acknowledging letters&#44; as I<lb/> always wait to hear again from you&#44; and you <del>probably</del><lb/> probably do the same&#44; but the delay with me at this<lb/> time was caused by a sudden pain in my eyes&#44;<lb/> and I feared to strain them lest the result might be<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>serious  How is Clara is she stronger and the<lb/> dear Nina&#44; I know&#44; has another tooth ere this&#44;<lb/> as the second generally appears shortly after the<lb/> first she has doubtless bitten her mama already<lb/> as that is a mischievous pleasure with the<lb/> little ones&#44; I am anxious to see the little darling<lb/> and often speak of her and Sammie does the<lb/> same&#44; bye the bye he has not improved in his<lb/> conduct&#44; but is without exception one of the most<lb/> forward children I meet with&#44; he desires love to Mr<lb/> &#38; Mrs. Morais and says you must kiss Nina for him.<lb/>  Schrivers Levys Mailerts Erekiel in fact all here<lb/> desire kind regards to yourself and family<lb/></p>
            <p>Tender my<lb/> best love to Clara kiss both her and Nina for me<lb/> and offer my kind regards to Mrs Weil &#38; family<lb/> Finsis and all others who inquire for me&#44; and believe me<lb/></p>
            <p>Yours ever truly<lb/>	
                Adeline Hyneman<lb/>
                Levy and all the children desire<lb/> love to all<lb/>
