            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. FIFTH STREET&#44;<lb/>
                PHILADELPHIA.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>H. M&#44; who in his youth was taught to read under&#45;<lb/>&#45;standingly the sublime diction language of the Hebrew Scriptures&#44;<lb/> might have devotionally sung with devotional fervor&#44; as he grew older&#44; the<lb/> soul&#45;stirring psalm&#44; which I have just recited.<lb/>  Looking backward to the days when he shook off the<lb/> dust of an ungracious land&#44;&#45;&#45;where the Jew was a pariah&#45;&#45;<lb/> and sailed towards the shores of a country&#44; in which tem&#45;<lb/>&#45;poral prosperity was awaiting him&#44; the heart of the<lb/> German Israelite might have exalted in the Lord.<lb/>  For&#44; visibly he was shown salvation&#59; palpably he<lb/> felt the God&#39;s inspired courage that finally won for him prosperity success.<lb/></p>  
            <p>Let those who so wish&#44; rummage through the<lb/> family archives&#44; if there be any&#44; that contain the history of this<lb/> Israelite coreligionist of mine.  Biographies ill accord with funeral services&#44;<lb/> but in vindication of God&#39;s goodness I am impelled<lb/> to say that the heavenly Creator did vouchsafe here over the coffin of a brother who now realizes<lb/> Truth&#44; that the heavenly Creator did vouchsafe to<lb/> crown H. M with favors.  My remem&#45;<lb/>&#45;brance of the deceased is not of yesterday.  I can<lb/> recall the time&#44; when he was my fellow&#45;<sic>worshipper</sic><lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>in the humble spot&#44; on which the pioneers of Judaism<lb/> in Philadelphia chose to erect thereupon a house<lb/> of prayer.  I can recall how nothing daunted by the difficulties which<lb/> he met in procuring the support of a growing family&#44;<lb/> he struggled on till success lighted upon his efforts.<lb/>  Was it chance&#59; was it luck&#63;  My knowledge<lb/> and belief answer&#58; &#34;Activity and probity which<lb/> prophets and moralists in touch with God&#44; have pro&#45; highly<lb/> &#45;mised approved of and recommended&#44; received a due reward.&#34;  To that I testify&#44;<lb/> and because I can say do so&#44; do so without fear of prevaricating&#44; and because my advancing<lb/> age and my acquaintance with the living and the<lb/> dead of the household issued from H M&#44; give me&#44;<lb/> measurably at least&#44; a certain title to precedence&#44; there&#45;<lb/>fore I have been asked to accompany the departed to<lb/> his resting place&#44; with Hebrew invocations.<lb/></p>
            <p>May the offspring of the prosperous man&#44; who paid<lb/> their father filial respect by enabling him to spend<lb/> his latter days in comfort and tranquility&#44; honor<lb/> his memory still further by deeds&#44; evincing faith<lb/> in God in a ruling Providence&#44; and by acts of saving charity.  For so have<lb/> the ancient sages told us &#91;Hebrew&#93; a child can<lb/> enhance the spiritual bliss of his parent.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>For the wife&#44; bereft of the companion of her youth&#44;<lb/> are human sympathies aroused.  All the sur&#45;<lb/>&#45;roundings which the love of the beautiful in nature<lb/> and in art can procure&#44; will not compensate for the<lb/> sorrow pain of a lasting separation on earth.  Mrs<lb/> M&#39;s loss appeals to our compassionate feelings.<lb/>  And as the Almighty alone can assuage grief&#44; I invoke<lb/> His name in behalf of the widow.  May she<lb/> obtain consolation from the religion in which she<lb/> was early reared&#44; and find a sweet alleviation to<lb/> her sadness sorrow in the devotion of every one to whom<lb/> she has given birth&#44; and for whose welfare she worked<lb/> long and steadily.  May she rejoice in their<lb/> activity wherever humanity cries for help and<lb/> in their upholding the principles of that belief<lb/> that which teaches that when our father and mother leave<lb/> us&#44; the Lord takes us in His Divine protection&#44; for<lb/> He is our merciful Judge&#44; as He is our Lawgiver&#44;<lb/> our only King and Saviour.  Amen<lb/></p>
