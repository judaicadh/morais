            <p>495 Lexington Av.<lb/>
                New York&#44; 15th Dec. 1885<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Sir&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>I did not write you for the last<lb/> two weeks because I preferred to wait un&#45;<lb/>til I had something more definite to commu&#45;<lb/>nicate that I yet had th opportunity of do&#45;<lb/>ing. I brought your project before the Board <lb/> of Trustees of our congregation&#44; as promised&#44;<lb/>  but I regret to say that no action was taken&#44;<lb/> as they did not seem to think it practicable&#44;<lb/> or that a college would be of any use. But<lb/> I do not intend to let the matter drop there.<lb/> At the next meeting I shall have it brought<lb/> to the vote&#59; and in order to test the temper<lb/> of the congregation and enable the trustees<lb/> to vote accordingly&#44; I am getting three hun&#45;<lb/>dred copies of your letter to me printed&#44; for<lb/> distribution&#44; among the contributors to our<lb/> Synagogue. I have also attached to it the<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>concluding paragraph of the leader of the &#34;Record&#34;<lb/> which you have kindly sent me. My sister<lb/> Mrs. Saml Piza&#44; has already promised me a<lb/> subscription of &#36;500 &#40;five hundred&#41; in memory<lb/> of her late husband&#44; to open a list with&#44; which<lb/> I hope the Board will foster&#59; and tho&#39; I have not yet<lb/> seen her&#44; to speak over the matter with&#44; I venture<lb/> the opinion that her family would add another<lb/> &#36;500. to it&#44; if  they thought the success of the un&#45;<lb/>dertaking depended on their contribution. I<lb/> have also  shown your letter to Mr. Henry Ger&#45;<lb/>soni&#44; and he promised me to do what he can<lb/> for the project&#44; in the papers for which he<lb/> writes. He requested me to tell you the same&#44;<lb/> and said that you would know that that means<lb/> something. He expressed the opinion that if<lb/> you don&#39;t succeed in what you undertake&#44; it<lb/> is because you are too despondent. Excuse me<lb/> repeating it&#58; I do it to encourage you. On the<lb/> other hand&#44; about ten days ago I also sent a<lb/> copy of your letter to J.A. Menken&#44; but as<lb/> he happened to get ill at the time&#44; I only got<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/> 
            <p>his reply yesterday&#44; a copy of which I beg to<lb/> hand you herewith. I took counsel with him<lb/> because tho&#39; he is not at present a worshipper in<lb/> an orthodox synagogue&#44; he is a strict observer<lb/> of the Sabbath&#44; and he is therefore more likely<lb/> to do good to our cause than a nominal or&#45;<lb/>thodox who desecrates it. Besides&#44; I know him<lb/> to be a friend of yours. But I do not agree<lb/> with his views. Therefore I would suggest<lb/> that you who have had a college in Philade<hi rend="sup">la</hi><lb/> and know that neither that nor the one in<lb/> <sic>Cincinatti</sic> needed as much money as he es&#45;<lb/>timates&#44; should write him&#44; to disprove this<del>.</del><lb/> and other fallacies of his&#44; as they seem to me. Of course our own aim in the establishment<lb/> of a college is to reach the <hi rend="underline">next</hi> generation&#59;<lb/> and tho&#39; it would undoubtedly take a long time<lb/> to put it on a firm and permanent basis&#44; in<lb/> the endeavor to do this&#44; we would unite our own<lb/> party and influence others&#59; and there is no reason<lb/> in the argument&#44; why we should not commence<lb/> on &#94; a small scale. If the institution<del>s</del> were once<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>in existence&#44; we could hope to get endorsements<lb/> later to enlarge it. Neither do we expect that the<lb/>Sheerit Israel congregation alone could attain<lb/> the hoped for result. Our purpose is to unite with<lb/> other Israelites all over the country&#44; as pleaded<lb/> in the editorial in the &#34;Record&#34;; and it is my opinion<lb/> that if we orthodox were  as expert and energetic<lb/> in availing ourselves of any opportunity afford&#45;<lb/>ed us as the reformers are in managing their<lb/> affairs&#44; we could capture at the present junc&#45;<lb/>ture the aid of may who have hitherto been in&#45;<lb/>different and apathetic because the danger<lb/> was less apparent. Here then lies the chance<lb/> of a reaction which Mr. M. thinks is sure to<lb/>come&#44; but which we have no reason to expect<lb/> otherwise&#44; for if we allow it to escape us&#44; we<lb/> are likely to fall more deeply into the abyss<lb/> of ignorance.&#45;&#45;And since you have asked me<lb/> to counsel you&#44; I would suggest your writing<lb/> also to the various ministers mentioned in my last&#44;<lb/> and others&#44; laymen as well&#44; who you think might<lb/> be serviceable to the cause. I understand that<lb/></p>

            <p>Dr. Drachman&#44; educated at the expense of the<lb/> Emanuel temple has turned out too orthodox<lb/> for them&#44; and has consequently accepted a<lb/> position in a small congregation in New&#45;<lb/>ark&#44; N.J.  I believe there are numerous<lb/> such congregations all over the land who w<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.<lb/> not refuse their mite if we had a well&#45;or&#45;<lb/>ganized body to reach them.  I would not<lb/> place all my dependence on large congregations<lb/> alone&#44; however apparently influential&#44; but<lb/> agitate in the endeavor to make the project<lb/> a popular one.  And as the Record is&#44; I believe&#44;<lb/> hardly seen in N.Y.&#44; it might not be out of<lb/> place for you to discuss the question also in<lb/> the American Hebrew and other organs&#44; per<del>sis</del><lb/>sistently.  If you fail of success&#44; there can be<lb/> no reproach in it.  Your memory will live<lb/> in having fought for a good cause&#44; and one<lb/> day your work will bear fruit.&#45;&#45;I would<lb/> also thank you to send me some plan of<lb/> the proposed institution&#59; based in a measure&#44;<lb/> if need be&#44; on that of the former Maimonides<lb/></p>
