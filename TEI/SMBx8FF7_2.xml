            <p>The selection of those who should form the Committee of Twenty&#45;Five on the<lb/></p>

            <p>was entrusted to a Committee of the first meeting&#44; and their task is an easy one.<lb/></p>
            <p>Those who should constitute this body <hi rend="underline">s e l e c t e d t h e m s e l v e s</hi>&#44;<lb/> for&#44; from a population of one million&#44; where the notice of an intended meeting to<lb/> promote this object was published&#44; and from among the six hundred to whom special<lb/> invitations were sent&#44; certain attended the meeting&#44; and other certain ones sent<lb/> cordial responses.<lb/></p>
            <p>They&#44; therefore&#44; as is said&#44; selected themselves&#44; and can unquestionably be<lb/> depended upon to carry forward the work from its inception to its final consumma&#45;<lb/>tion.<lb/></p>
            <p>Some can give work&#44; all can&#44; by their manifested sympathy&#44; give important as&#45;<lb/>sistance.  It is possible&#44; indeed&#44; that some&#44; from necessary causes&#44; can only give<lb/> the weight of their names&#44; and that&#44; itself&#44; is important.<lb/></p>
            <p>I need not say that you were appointed a member of this Committee&#44; and it is<lb/> only necessary now to have your formal adhesion&#45;&#45;which I confidently anticipate.<lb/></p>
            <p>I hand you a list of names that you may have confidence that the work&#44; when<lb/> begun and carried on&#44; will be <hi rend="underline">w e l l  d o n e</hi>.<lb/></p>

            <p>concentrating it&#44; and also&#44; of gathering some money.<lb/></p>
            <p>For the occasion of the presentation of the Testimonial&#44; the admirable Poem&#44;<lb/> by Mr. John Collins<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;T H E  C R Y  O F  T H E  E X I L E&#34;<lb/></p>
            <p>will constitute a literary incident of the highest order.  The sale of copies of<lb/> the same&#44; illustrated&#44; say&#44; by George A. Frost&#44; will also contribute to the funds.<lb/></p>
            <p>The artistic Testimonial need not coat much in money.  Pure Aluminum should<lb/> constitute the base&#45;&#45;because that metal is found in all earth&#45;&#45;and from the <sic>eart</sic><lb/> we are all made&#44; on it we live and move and have our being&#58; and to it we return<lb/> at death.  Aluminum is also the ideal metal&#44; and the ideal metal of the new era.<lb/></p>
            <p>Aluminum bronze&#44; or other alloy might well be used for the four or more<lb/> groups of Siberian exiles to be placed at each corner.<lb/></p>
            <p>The portrait figure of George Kennan will surmount the pedestal&#45;&#45;the latter&#44;<lb/> itself&#44; carrying bas reliefs and appropriate inscriptions.<lb/></p>
            <p>We are able to call for the highest art to model these figures&#44; because sculp&#45;<lb/>tors will feel proud to associate their names <del>witht</del> with this Historic work.<lb/></p>
            <p>Replicas of the &#91;&#63;&#93; original Testimonial&#44; and other reduced copies in metal<lb/> china&#44; pottery&#44; and other plastic materials will form a source of revenue.<lb/></p>
            <p>The sale of copies of the portrait statuette of George Kennan&#44; and of the ind<lb/> independent groups on the base&#44; and of the plaques on the pedestal&#44; carrying the<lb/> bas&#45;reliefs and inscriptions&#44; will&#44; unquestionably&#44; also yield a profit.  Engrav&#45;<lb/>ings and prints can also be <sic>sold&#45;&#45;amd</sic> the pictorial papers <hi rend="underline">all over the world</hi>&#44;<lb/> will be only too glad to add fuel to the fire by using electrotypes&#44; and printing<lb/> exhaustive descriptions.<lb/></p>
            <p>The popularity already gained for the movement will bring all the papers and<lb/> popular magazines to publish more or less of our work.<lb/></p>
            <p>Indeed&#44; as our Testimonial need cost only a moderate sum&#45;&#45;and as Mr. Kennan&#44;<lb/> himself&#44; would not so much enjoy a large sum of money locked up in the concrete<lb/> object&#44; as the same sum used to further the cause&#44; we can count on having a hand&#45;<lb/>some sum to carry our American delegates to St. Petersburg and back from the In&#45;<lb/>ternational Prison Association Congress&#44; next September&#45;&#45;and money&#44; too&#44; for the<lb/> suffering exiles.<lb/></p>
            <p>There are many incidental clues which have already presented themselves&#44; and<lb/> many more will suggest themselves as we go along.<lb/></p>

            <p>The gentlemen who are actively managing the getting of signatures to the Petition<lb/> will find our Testimonial meetings their best opportunity to promote and secure<lb/> <sic>waht</sic> they are after.  The ladies&#44; in their Russian Peasant costumes&#45;&#45;the copies of<lb/> the Testimonial&#44; and of its separate parts&#45;&#45;the Tea&#45;Cups&#44; and other objects of<lb/> porcelain&#45;&#45;the engravings&#44; the pictorials&#44; &#38;c.&#44; &#38;c.&#44; all these will <sic>addd</sic> a most<lb/> effective aid&#45;&#45;and probably it will be a most essential one&#45;&#45;to that work which <sic>th</sic><lb/> they have taken upon themselves as their duty.<lb/></p>
            <p>This <sic>Petiotion</sic>&#44; of course&#44; to be complete&#44; must be signed by American men&#44;<lb/> women&#44; and children&#44; of all antecedents&#45;&#45;all colors&#45;&#45;all religions.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Catholics feel sore over the oppression exercised towards those of their<lb/> faith&#44; in Poland.  Four thousand Catholic Poles are in Philadelphia alone&#44; as I am<lb/> assured by the Rev. Dr. Horstman&#44; Chancellor of Archbishop Ryan&#44; by religious per&#45;<lb/>secution.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Germans&#44; generally&#44; feel sore at the persistent crushing out of their<lb/> language in the German provinces of Russia&#58; while the Lutherans most naturally re&#45;<lb/>sent the efforts of the Czar&#39;s Government which seeks to crush out their Cult in<lb/> the Baltic provinces of Russia.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Jews feel no less sore at the atrocities exercised upon their brethren&#44;<lb/> and the expatriation of their co&#45;religionists.<lb/></p>
            <p>The overshadowing of India by the Czar&#44; and the fear of their losing their<lb/> hold upon Hindoustan&#44; which they are threatened with by the building of an Asiatic<lb/> Railroad&#44; screened on the north by the range of mountains bordering their Indian<lb/> possessions&#44; adds the weight of the Briton to the movement.<lb/></p>
            <p>While the French Government is in diplomatic relations with the Czar&#39;s&#44; no <sic>on</sic><lb/> one can doubt that the sympathy of the French republicans&#44; as well as those of<lb/> Switzerland&#44; are for the oppressed peoples.<lb/></p>
            <p>Italy&#44; of course&#44; sides with Germany in antagonizing the Czar&#45;&#45;while Austria<lb/> is kept on the constant qui vive&#44; and is periodically marshalling her troops to<lb/> repel a dreaded invasion from her eastern neighbor.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Turk&#44; though feeble&#44; is not insignificant when backed by the strong west&#45;<lb/>ern powers.<lb/></p>
            <p>With all these potent forces&#44; there is a l l i e d in the matter of this<lb/> Testimonial&#44; the e m o t i o n a l  and i n t e l l e c t u a l sympathies<lb/></p>

            <p>of every human being that hates cruelty&#44; and especially hates cruelty to the de&#45;<lb/>fenceless&#44; to the feeble woman and to children.<lb/></p>
            <p>The Patriotic sentiment of Americans is also <sic>arrused</sic> to do honor to the man&#44; who&#44; as<lb/> Sergius Stepniak well said&#44; had&#44; by his exposure of the cruelties inflicted upon<lb/> patriotic Russians&#44; struck the most telling blow against the continuance of those<lb/> cruelties&#44; and they are <sic>anxius</sic> to testify their appreciation of the heroic and un&#45;<lb/>selfish labors of the man who has added lustre to the name &#34;American.&#34;<lb/></p>
