            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            <p>Oh&#33; that expressions of sympathy could lessen the weight of sorrow<lb/> lying on a mother&#39;s heart.  I would call blessed every<lb/> utterance of my lips.  But how strive to comfort another&#44;<lb/> when I myself am whelmed with grief&#63;  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> &#34;My friends&#33; pity me&#44; pity me.&#34;  I loved well the youth<lb/> I daily taught.  He whom death has so suddenly&#44; alas&#33;<lb/> matched away&#44; had commended himself to my earnest solicitude.<lb/>  Fatherless he was&#44; and in a state of dependence&#44; but withal<lb/> the object&#44; around which the brightest hopes of a widowed<lb/> mothers were centred.  I felt religiously bound to do<lb/> him good.  My mind&#39;s eye rested with complacence upon<lb/> the future results of my endeavours.  I anticipated the<lb/> time when the lad benevolently cared for&#44; by my Brethren of a<lb/> sister city&#44; would stand forth a learned &#38; pious teacher in Israel.<lb/>  When I might say to the feeble mother.  &#34;Lean now on thy son<lb/> for support.&#34;  But in a moment those glowing anticipations<lb/> vanished away &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Like a dream&#44; like a<lb/> vision at night have been all my expectations.  I awoke&#44;<lb/> to contemplate the lifeless body....But not I alone<lb/> grieve over the death of my promising pupil.  Every one<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>that heard him at the house of God&#44; when he attained<lb/> his religious majority&#59; every one that heard his simply<lb/> written&#44; but well indited deserved composition at the examination of<lb/> the Hebrew Sunday School&#59; every one that was privileged to<lb/> listen to his answers at the closing of the second session of the<lb/> Maimonides College&#44; bewail with me this untimely loss.<lb/>  For many knew the youth&#44; and prayed he might live<lb/> to strengthen the pillars of Judaism&#44; to be an ornament<lb/> of society&#44; and a perennial source of joy to his hitherto hapless<lb/> mother.  God willed it not.  Who can say unto<lb/> Him &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;What dost Thou&#34;&#63;  He is most wise<lb/> in council and merciful.  We are finite beings&#44; shrouded in a veil<lb/> of ignorance&#44; often mistaking some fleeting advantage&#44; for<lb/> a durable benefit.  Yet&#44; judging humanly&#44; we<lb/> would condemn this poor lad.  We would attribute the<lb/> cause of his untimely decease to the sin of deception.<lb/>  Acquainted as we are with the character of his guardians&#44;<lb/> we can bear testimony to their unremitting cares.  We<lb/> can vouch for the watchfulness then exhibited&#59; in directing<lb/> his steps to the right path.  But Ignatz J Klein did once<lb/> swerve from it.  He stealthily betook himself where he<lb/> had not been permitted to go&#44; and where&#44; alas&#33; the fell destroyer<lb/></p>

            <p>was lying in wait&#44; to make secure him as his victim.<lb/>  Youths who are within hearing of my address.  Let the fatal<lb/> end of your companion&#44; prove to you a healthful lesson.<lb/>  Frequently you imagine that your parents or wardens&#44; are<lb/> capricious.  That without any reasonable cause they deprive<lb/> you of innocent pleasures.  Harbor not that pernicious<lb/> thought.  Do not permit wanton and froward sons to<lb/> instill that poison into your minds.  &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> Listen &#34;Harken to instruction&#44; and become wise&#44; and be not unruly&#34;.<lb/>  Heed the bidding of those superior to you in years and experience.<lb/>  Heed it implicitly.  In your age&#44; obedience is&#44; under Providence&#44;<lb/> your safeguard&#44; the shield of your moral and spiritual existence.<lb/>  Had Ignatz Klein clung to that virtue&#44; he might have<lb/> grown &#91;Hebrew&#93; as a tree bearing exuberant fruits in<lb/> the courts of our Lord&#59; whereas we now surround his coffin<lb/> with tear sobs and tears.  But you desolate<lb/> mother&#44; you of all hopes forlorn&#44; how shall I address&#63;<lb/>  I am utterly disqualified to offer comfort.  The feelings<lb/> of sympathy I entertain are most intense&#44; but words will<lb/> not flow.  Mother of my departed pupil.  Set commu&#45;<lb/>&#45;nion with your God&#44; calm the throbbings of your breast.<lb/>  Join me in prayer.<lb/></p>

            <p>Good God&#33;  Thy hand woundeth&#44; but also healeth.<lb/>  How am I a broken hearted mother&#44; seeking a some restorative balm<lb/> for the deep strokes inflicted by the Messenger of Thy will<lb/> In my misery&#44; I cast the burden of my affliction upon<lb/> Thy fatherly bosom.  Relieve me&#44; according to Thy mercy.<lb/>  Teach me to hear with resignation this last and severest of<lb/> my trials.  From the depth of distress&#44; into which the<lb/> untimely loss of my promising child&#44; has plunged me&#44;<lb/> I look up to Thee&#44; with tearful but not reproachful eyes.<lb/>  Abraham&#44; would have <sic>yeilded</sic> his son unto Thee&#44; as a testimony<lb/> of his love righteousness fidelity.  I have <sic>yeilded</sic> my son&#44; my only son&#44; whom I loved&#44; my<lb/> Isaac&#44; as the most precious of my offerings.  May the<lb/> memory of his good qualities&#44; and of the knowledge he<lb/> acquired of Thy name and Thy stability partly assuage the pangs<lb/> of the departure.  Infuse O God&#44; into the last survivor<lb/> of my family&#45;&#45;this daughter of my affection&#45;&#45;sentiments<lb/> of parental reverence.  Peradventure&#44; gloom may at length give<lb/> room to joyfulness.  Bless O Lord&#33; those who have loved&#44; him<lb/> I loved&#44; and labored to gather honors for him I longed to see<lb/> highly honored.  And let this month&#44; memorable for the<lb/> national tribulations endured&#44; usher in another&#44; as the herald<lb/> of Divine forgiveness&#44; divine grace&#44; and redemption for the<lb/> house of Israel&#44; what wheresoever they be scattered.  Amen.<lb/></p>
