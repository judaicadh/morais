            <p>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 1885.&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear  Mr. Morais&#58;&#45;&#45;<lb/></p>
            <p>I should have written you last<lb/> week about a matter but could not<lb/> find the time. Mr. M. Ellinger desires to write<lb/> for us a series of articles enunciating the stand&#45;<lb/>point of reform on leading questions&#44;<lb/> such as the Restoration&#44; the Resurrection&#44;<lb/> Sabbath&#44; Dietary Laws etc. He wishes to do<lb/> this&#44; as he says&#44; that the position of reform<lb/> may be understood. Kohler he says&#44; has done<lb/> justice to neither his own side nor to<lb/> conservatism&#44; inasmuch as he has failed<lb/> to <del>reg</del> recognize conservatism as it is<lb/> regarded by its own leaders&#44; but has<del>e</del><lb/> opposed an orthodoxy of the past&#44; so to say.<lb/> Mr. Ellinger is an able writer and we are<lb/> certain that his articles would command<lb/> attention. We would therefore like to<lb/> put an antidote alongside of him&#44; and<lb/> are tempted to call upon you first&#44;<lb/> to see if your time and inclination<lb/> will induce you to take up the pen<lb/> again.  <del>Mr</del> The plan is to publish in the<lb/>  &#34;Amer. Hebrew&#34; in the same issue articles on<lb/> the same subject from a reform &#38; orthodox<lb/> standpoint&#44; all articles to be briefly stated<lb/> and not to occupy over two columns.<lb/> This will insure their being read by all.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>The articles are <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to be of a contro&#45;<lb/>versial nature&#44; but a statement of the po&#45;<lb/>sition of each party on the subject in<lb/> question. When I suggested to Mr Ellinger<lb/> the idea&#44; he was pleased with it&#44; but<lb/> would like to have you take the other side.<lb/> In this connection I may say&#44; Mr. Morais&#44;<lb/> that the tone of your articles has<del>e</del><lb/> aroused a great deal of admiration<lb/> for your position among persons<lb/> of all degrees <del>of</del> &#40;and none&#41; of Judaism&#44; and<lb/> they have been pronounced as the<lb/> best articles &#91;overwritten&#58; o&#93;in the recent controversy.<lb/> As one is generally assured of the<lb/> approval of his own side of the house&#44;<lb/> I know it will be gratifying for you to<lb/> know that Dr. Kohler was highly pleased with the<lb/> tone of your articles&#44; and he said that such<lb/> contribute to the value of a discussion. Mr.<lb/> Ellinger liked them so much that he wished<lb/> you to write the companion series of his<lb/> for simultaneous publication. Mr. Halmes&#45;<lb/>singer&#91;&#63;&#93; expressed himself as deeply interested&#44;<lb/> and on Thursday night last I called on<lb/> Mr. Julius Bien who&#44; while he takes a deep<lb/> interest in communal affairs&#44; does not con&#45;<lb/>cern himself in religious affairs&#59; yet. though<lb/> he had only ret<hi rend="sup">d</hi>  from Europe the week<lb/> before&#44; had read through the whole<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>of your series and admired your tone.<lb/> &#34;The man&#44;&#34; he said in speaking of them &#34;who<lb/> frankly admits that he can not fully<lb/> account for a certain state of things&#44;<lb/> strengthens his position &#94; otherwise by doing so&#44; more<lb/> than he who&#44; if he does not offer a palpably<lb/> lame apology or argument&#44; or squirm<lb/> out of it in some way&#44; avoids the<lb/> matter entirely.<lb/></p>
            <p>I could tell you of minor lights who<lb/> feel the same way&#44; but this will satisfy you<lb/> <sic>you</sic> that your labors have not been<lb/> in vain.<lb/></p>
            <p>It is for this reason that we are the<lb/> more anxious to have you take part<lb/> in the proposed series. Mr. Ellinger&#44; who<lb/> in days gone by has done some rough<lb/> newspaper fighting&#44; intends writing his<lb/> articles in your style. Of course time<lb/> does not get a chance to hang heavily<lb/> on your hands&#44; so you must know<lb/> best whether you can spare the time.<lb/> They need not be consecutive&#44; but<lb/> can appear from time to time.<lb/></p>
            <p>Very truly yrs<lb/>
                P. Cowen<lb/></p>
