            <p>Chicago Jan 11th 1894<lb/></p>
            <p>Dear Father&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>Your letter of the 9th inst. just<lb/> received&#44; now then I will tell you exactly<lb/> how I sank so low and tho&#39; it is indeed<lb/> hard to tell it and it will be hard for<lb/> you to hear still you ask for it and I give<lb/> you the truth&#44;<lb/></p>
            <p>I lived opposite gambling houses<lb/> in Kansas City Kas at 6th &#38; Javier for over 5<lb/> years and never went near them&#44; and I was<lb/> pointed out by all who knew me as a<lb/> model young man&#44; and all the good reports<lb/> you heard of me while I was in Kansas City<lb/> were true and so are the bad ones that you<lb/> hear now<lb/></p>
            <p>Well when I left home last summer<lb/> a year ago after having been so ill&#44; I came<lb/> back to Kansas City and got sick again<lb/> then I lay idle and that curse came upon<lb/> me to gamble I started in on Aug 23rd 1892<lb/> and tho&#39; Mr Simms begged and helped.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>me to quit and he was the only other per&#45;<lb/>son besides myself who knew it yet I<lb/> could not resist temptations I think<lb/> sickness must have made me very weak<lb/> mentally&#44; so I lost hundreds of dollars and<lb/> borrowed hundreds from Mr Simms and<lb/> others until Oct 18&#45;1892 when after<lb/> having tried and tried to overcome this<lb/> passion for this wickedness&#44; I implored the<lb/> help of God and with His help I quit and as<lb/> I thought never to fall into such a habit<lb/> again&#44; of course I kept it from you for I<lb/> knew it would break your heart&#44; then I<lb/> owed over &#36;180 and I resolved to deny<lb/> myself everything to square it and again<lb/> be able to look the world in the face&#44;<lb/> so after living in a freezing cold room<lb/> all winter in order to reduce expenses&#44;<lb/> and looking very ragged and ay&#39; even<lb/> dirty to save laundry bills on Feb 5th<lb/> 1893 I was again square with the<lb/> world not one penny did I owe&#44; and<lb/> I did very well for nearly 5 months<lb/> tho&#39; I saved no money&#44; still I owed no<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>more&#44; and I had good prospects until on<lb/> June 30th I started out to the races and<lb/> lost a few dollars&#44; stung by that loss<lb/> I started in again and so it was every<lb/> cent I earned outside of my board and<lb/> lodging I gambled&#44; and then after conquer&#45;<lb/>ing the passion for a few weeks I would<lb/> start in again worse than ever&#44; so on<lb/> Aug 17th 1893 I went off one day at 12.30<lb/> from M K Wei&#39;s and never went<lb/> back&#44; then two days after Mr Cay<lb/> was glad to take me at &#36;65 per month<lb/> with prospects of an interest in the<lb/> business&#44; then after staying right for<lb/> nearly a month the terrible temptation<lb/> came upon me again and I started in<lb/> again on my downward course and<lb/> Mr. Cay after repeatedly warning me finally<lb/> discharged me&#44; the first time in my<lb/> life that I was ever discharged&#44; as I al&#45;<lb/>ways did my duties capably&#44; then I<lb/> stayed around Kansas City over two<lb/> months borrowing here and there and<lb/> owing a board bill&#44; till finally after<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>being disappointed in several<del>e</del> situations<lb/> I left for St Louis&#44; nothing there I came<lb/> here which is worse yet&#44; Oh I &#91;&#63;&#93; what<lb/> I have been&#44; and if I were like some<lb/> men I would not care&#44; but believe me<lb/> Father I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> care for before God I<lb/> swear it that if I live all this money<lb/> will be paid back if it take every drop<lb/> of my blood to do it&#44; I only wish that<lb/> I could see you for I would rather talk<lb/> to you than write&#44; yes I pray to God to<lb/> forgive me for all the misery and heart&#45;<lb/>aches that I have caused you&#44; and He<lb/> knows that I feel myself what I have<lb/> fallen into and I must lift myself<lb/> out of not only for the sake of the<lb/> name I bear but to show those whom<lb/> I have wronged and whose confidence<lb/> I have betrayed that I am <hi rend="underline">a man</hi><lb/> for all that.<lb/></p>
            <p>Depend upon it that any<lb/> money that I received in Chicago was<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>not received in any way so as to hurt<lb/> your good name and will be paid<lb/> back.<lb/></p>
            <p>I know it is hard to make<lb/> even those who love you believe you<lb/> when you have done so much evile<lb/> but God knows I am telling you the<lb/> truth&#44; for I never until this evil<lb/> came over me wrote you one lie<lb/> from Kansas City and the business<lb/> in which I was was &#91;&#63;&#93; a business<lb/> of lies that is certain.<lb/></p>
            <p>As I said before<lb/> and I said it to my sisters&#44; I want<lb/> none of your money that I cannot<lb/> pay back&#44; either now or if I should<lb/> be unfortunate enough to outlive you&#44;<lb/> for I if I could regain the reputation<lb/> character and all that I have lost<lb/> in the past six months I would<lb/> not take all the money that<lb/> any man could give me.<lb/></p>

            <p>No my Father I am bent soley on<lb/> one thing that is the determination<lb/> to redeem myself in Kansas City<lb/> Philadelphia and in fact before all<lb/> those who know me so that some<lb/> day I can go back&#44; to Mr Simms<lb/> my truest friend and say to<lb/> him <hi rend="underline">I am a man</hi>.<lb/></p>
            <p>Now then where to<lb/> go and I must go <hi rend="underline">soon</hi> for here<lb/> small pox is raving and in the<lb/> cheap lodging houses where I stay<lb/> although the beds are clean still<lb/> the people are common dirty fellows<lb/> and might bring the dreaded disease<lb/> into the places.<lb/></p>
            <p>Here are figures although<lb/> I know it is very different to determine<lb/> what point to go to now still I think<lb/> either way up north or west or south<lb/> are the places&#44; I have inquired the<lb/> prices of tickets from Chicago to<lb/> California or Texas&#44; to the former<lb/> the 2nd class rate is 47.50<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>and of course would necessitate tak&#45;<lb/>ing a cheap sleeper which is &#36;4 for four<lb/> nights and days&#44; to Texas the 2nd<lb/> class fare is &#36;18.75 and one would<lb/> not need a sleeper as the journey<lb/> is only two days and 2 nights&#44; now<lb/> I will go to either place&#44; makes<lb/> no difference and then I will begin<lb/> life over again once more and <hi rend="underline">try</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">try</hi> so hard to redeem myself and<lb/> make my name what it should<lb/> be.<lb/></p>
            <p>If you decide to send me money<lb/> to go either west or south&#44; send a draft<lb/> or registered letter to me.<lb/></p>
            <p>Your Son.<lb/> Leon<lb/></p>
            <p>Please let me hear from you as soon as you<lb/> will.<lb/></p>
