            <p>JACOB VOORSANGER&#44;<lb/>
                RABBI OF TEMPLE EMANUEL<lb/>
                2316 CALIFORNIA STREET.<lb/></p>
            <p>SAN FRANCISCO&#44; CAL. May 29 1893<lb/></p>
            <p>The Rev Dr. S. Morais&#44;<lb/>
                Philadelphia&#44; Pa.<lb/>
                My dear Sir<lb/></p>
            <p>The first leisure moments I enjoy after a long season<lb/> of arduous labor I employ in penning you a few lines.  First of all&#44;<lb/> permit me to inform you that my dear second son&#44; Leon Morais Voorsanger&#44;<lb/> was a &#91;Hebrew&#93; on last Shabuoth and read the &#91;Hebrew&#93; in a<lb/> clear&#44; strong voice to the evident delectation of the vast congregation present.<lb/>  In our service we read from &#91;Hebrew&#93; until &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; nearly two chapters&#44;<lb/> and the lad proved to be well trained.  In view of the fact that about the<lb/> same time last year we were about to lose our child&#44; of which I wrote you<lb/> at the time&#44; you can understand how happy his mother and I have<lb/> been and we pray that we may yet bring him &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  The boy<lb/> has not only fully recovered his strength&#44; but he has never been in such<lb/> good health and his career in the schools is brilliant indeed.  I will take<lb/> it as a kindly act&#44; if out of your goodness of heart you will send<lb/> my dear child&#44; who after a fashion is your God&#45;son&#44; a few words<lb/> of blessing&#44; and coming from you he will thoroughly appreciate them&#44;<lb/> for he knows you well&#44; since his father often speaks of you.  The fact<lb/> that he read the &#91;Hebrew&#93; should convince you of two things&#59; first&#44; that we have<lb/> an excellent Hebrew department in our religious school&#44; and secondly&#44;<lb/> that we are not so radical as perhaps we are made out to be.<lb/></p>
            <p>You have no doubt already met the Rev Joseph L. Levy.  I have made<lb/> it his duty to call on you on my personal behalf&#44; to be as &#91;Hebrew&#93; and<lb/> to convey to you my unchanged sentiments of regard and affection.<lb/>  I hope he has done so&#59; but it would not surprise me if he had not.<lb/>  I see from the journals that he has already incurred your displeasure&#44;<lb/> and I venture to recommend&#44; that you reserve your sage and eloquent<lb/> words for more dangerous opponents.  The young man is an enthusiast&#44;<lb/> believes that an unbridled tongue is a meritorious thing&#44; and has not<lb/> the faintest conception of discretion.  He possesses some education&#59; half<lb/> of his reading is undigested&#44; and I dare say&#44; his elevation has com&#45;<lb/>pletely intoxicated him.  He means well enough&#59; and he is a kindly<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>fellow&#44; who ten years hence will sing a different song.  He lacks the<lb/> conservatism of age&#44; and I beg you to be patient with him.  He served<lb/> three years on this Coast&#44; and left many friends.<lb/>
                And now a word or two about literary matters.  May I inquire of you&#44; whether<lb/> the famous expression &#91;Hebrew&#93; is at all found in the<lb/> Talmud&#63;  I cannot find it after the most diligent search&#44; of course&#44; it<lb/> is found in Maimonides&#39; &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; where the &#91;Hebrew&#93; quotes &#91;Hebrew&#93;<lb/> but that must be a misprint for on that page there is not the faintest<lb/> suggestion of such a text.  The quotation that comes nearest to it is<lb/> in &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; where the Talmud tries so curiously to<lb/> prove that Job has no share in the future world &#91;Hebrew&#93;.<lb/>  What makes me suspicious is the fact that Kohut&#39;s Arukh S. V. &#91;Hebrew&#63;&#93; does not<lb/> quote the passage&#44; and that the passage itself is fashioned after the Talmud&#45;<lb/>ical &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; which&#44; if I have not forgotten&#44; is in &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Will<lb/> you kindly give me information on the subject&#63;<lb/></p>
            <p>My next query is the following&#58; How do you&#44; from your standpoint&#44; account for<lb/> the discrepancy in the text of the Ten commandments in Deuteronomy and<lb/> Exodus&#63;  In the fourth word&#44; the text is so variant that it excites the closest<lb/> inquiry.  Much has been written on the subject&#59; but little satisfies me.  The most<lb/> radical difference is that the Deuteronomist bases the observance of the Sabbath<lb/> on &#91;Hebrew&#93; and the author of Exodus on the creation of the world.  Did<lb/> Moses write them both&#63;  The most vexatious part of it is that both Exodus<lb/> and Deuteronomy attribute the words to God&#59; in Exodus &#91;Hebrew&#93; and in<lb/> Deuteronomy &#91;Hebrew&#93;&#44; where the word &#91;Hebrew&#93; excites my suspicion&#44;<lb/> inasmuch as the term &#91;Hebrew&#93; is used in Numbers.  How do you explain it&#63;  Would<lb/> you object to an explanation that accounts for an original Ten words&#44;<lb/> which&#44; later on&#44; in ten different versions&#44; found their way to the North<lb/> and South of Palestine&#63;  I am anxious about this matter.  I know that<lb/> you are more liberal with the prophets&#44; so far as text&#45;criticism is con&#45;<lb/>cerned&#44; than with the Pentateuch&#44; and it is in view of your conservative<lb/> views that I prefer to have my query answered by you.  It will be<lb/> unnecessary to give me the Jewish views&#44; I know them.  I am anxious<lb/> for a personal opinion.<lb/></p>
            <p>I have&#44; last winter&#44; prepared and delivered a course of nine lectures on the poetry of the<lb/> old Testament&#44; which before publication I would like to submit to<lb/> your inspection.  They are radical but &#91;Hebrew&#93;.  Would you under&#45;<lb/>take the task&#63;  Awaiting an early reply I am as ever<lb/> Faithfully yours<lb/> Jacob Voorsanger<lb/></p>
