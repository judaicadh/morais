            <p>UNIVERSITY EXTENSION.<lb/>
                I. THE AIM AND SCOPE OF THE MOVEMENT.<lb/></p>
            <p>The purpose of the University Extension movement is to<lb/> provide the means of higher education for persons of all classes<lb/> and of both sexes engaged in the regular occupations of life.  It<lb/> is&#44; in fact&#44; an attempt to solve the problem of how much of<lb/> what the Universities do for their own students can be done for<lb/> persons unable to go to a University.<lb/></p>
            <p>The movement was started in 1872 by the University of<lb/> Cambridge&#44; and the work has been carried on in England with<lb/> increasing success.  Last year nearly forty thousand students<lb/> attended courses of lectures at about three hundred centres in<lb/> England and Wales.<lb/></p>
            <p>The fundamental idea throughout has been education for<lb/> busy people.  The majority of the courses have been given in<lb/> the evening&#44; and the audiences have included persons drawn<lb/> from all ranks of society and of the widest diversity of previous<lb/> education and training.  Ladies&#44; business and professional men&#44;<lb/> clerks&#44; tradespeople&#44; and teachers in schools have all been rep&#45;<lb/>resented in the lecture&#45;audiences&#59; while the courses in East<lb/> London and Northern part of England have been largely<lb/> attended by working&#45;people.<lb/></p>
            <p>METHOD OF WORK.<lb/></p>
            <p>The work in Philadelphia is under the management and<lb/> supervision of the Philadelphia Society for the Extension of<lb/> University Teaching&#44; which will act in close connection with the<lb/> University of Pennsylvania&#44; Jefferson Medical College&#44; Lehigh<lb/> University&#44; Bryn Mawr&#44; Swarthmore&#44; Haverford&#44; Lafayette and<lb/> Franklin and Marshall Colleges&#44; Academy of Natural Sciences&#44;<lb/> the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association&#44; the Pennsylvania Mu&#45;<lb/>seum and School of Industrial Art&#44; and other teaching bodies.<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>In order to make the teaching at the same time attractive<lb/> to those who merely desire to attend the lectures&#44; and thor&#45;<lb/>oughly educational for students who wish to make a more sys&#45;<lb/>tematic study of the subject&#44; a special method is followed.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;1&#41; LECTURES.&#45;&#45;The Courses consist of from six to twelve weekly or fort&#45;<lb/>nightly lectures&#44; given during the three months before Christmas&#44; called the<lb/> First Term&#44; or the three months after Christmas&#44; called the Second Term&#44;<lb/> each lecture occupying an hour.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;2&#41; CLASS.&#45;&#45;For about three&#45;quarters of an hour preceding or following each<lb/> lecture&#44; a class is held for those students who wish to study the subject more<lb/> thoroughly.  The object of the class is to give the students an opportunity of<lb/> coming into personal contact with the Lecturer&#44; in order that they may&#44; by<lb/> conversation and discussion with him&#44; the better familiarize their minds with<lb/> the principles of the subject&#44; and get their special difficulties explained.  The<lb/> teaching in the class is conversational.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;3&#41; SYLLABUS.&#45;&#45;In order to enable students to follow the lecture readily&#44; and<lb/> carry away the substance of it&#44; a printed syllabus&#44; usually in pamphlet form&#44;<lb/> is prepared beforehand by the Lecturer for the use of the students&#44; and sold at<lb/> a low price.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;4&#41; WEEKLY PAPERS.&#45;&#45;Questions are set on each lecture&#44; which may be an&#45;<lb/>swered by the students&#44; in writing at home&#44; and submitted to the Lecturer for<lb/> correction and comment.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;5&#41; EXAMINATION.&#45;&#45;At the end of the Course an Examination is held by the<lb/> Lecturer&#44; and only <sic>thoses</sic> students are admitted to the Examinations who have<lb/> attended the lectures and classes to the satisfaction of the Lecturer&#44; and have<lb/> done such an amount of weekly paper work as the Lecturer may have required.<lb/></p>
            <p>&#40;6&#41; CERTIFICATES.&#45;&#45;Certificates are awarded in connection with these<lb/> Courses to those who satisfy the Lecturer in the weekly work and pass the<lb/> Examination.<lb/></p>
            <p>THE SUCCESS OF THE METHOD.<lb/></p>
            <p>The success which has attended the working of this method<lb/> in England&#44; has proved that the attainment of a very high stand&#45;<lb/>ard of training and knowledge is possible by attendance at Uni&#45;<lb/>versity Extension Courses&#44; provided the student carries out the<lb/> system in its entirety.<lb/></p>
            <p>It will be seen&#44; therefore&#44; that this system is adapted at the<lb/> same time to persons who desire merely a general acquaintance&#45;<lb/>ship with the subjects taught&#44; as well as to students who are<lb/> anxious to make a more thorough study.  The courses have<lb/> covered various departments in Science&#44; Literature&#44; History&#44;<lb/> Economics and Art&#44; and have been fully illustrated&#44; where nec&#45;<lb/>essary&#44; with experiments and diagrams or the lantern.<lb/></p>
            <p>THE PHILADELPHIA SOCIETY<lb/>
                FOR THE<lb/>
                EXTENSION OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING<lb/></p>
            <p>has been organized to promote the effort in an educational field<lb/> which has been hitherto almost entirely neglected.  The univer&#45;<lb/>sal establishment of public free schools&#44; and their results in<lb/> removing illiteracy&#44; are matters of such recent date that we are<lb/> just beginning to realize what excellent foundations they furnish<lb/> upon which to build higher and higher the educational structures<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="5"/>
            <p>of general society.  At present vast numbers are compelled by<lb/> the needs of livelihood to leave school at an early age&#44; and very<lb/> many more who can continue long enough to secure a good<lb/> common school education are still unable to share in the privi&#45;<lb/>leges of higher education&#44; which at present requires prolonged<lb/> attendance upon College or University courses.  This is a pri&#45;<lb/>vate misfortune to the many&#44; as well as a great public weakness<lb/> in the State&#44; and the best energies of all who are interested<lb/> in the public welfare should be earnestly exerted to seek out<lb/> and apply a remedy.  In England the great Universities have<lb/> established courses of University teaching in cities&#44; towns and<lb/> villages throughout the kingdom wherever an opportunity can<lb/> be found or created&#44; and the success of their efforts is shown<lb/> by the fact that during the past year more than 40&#44;000 students<lb/> enjoyed the advantages of such instruction.  Here&#44; where the<lb/> conditions are different&#44; though the need is as great&#44; this work<lb/> must be done by a strong and intelligent organization of citi&#45;<lb/>zens&#44; working in close connection with the existing teaching<lb/> bodies which afford facilities for higher education.  Our Society<lb/> has been organized in the belief that the task which it attempts<lb/> will invite general co&#45;operation.  It seems clear that the scheme<lb/> will invite general co&#45;operation.  It seems clear that the scheme<lb/> to open out University courses of standard value and character<lb/> in Science&#44; Art&#44; Literature and History to thousands and tens<lb/> of thousands of intelligent workers&#44; and to do it in such a way<lb/> that the studies can be pursued leisurely and without drawing<lb/> the students from the work by which they earn their living&#44;<lb/> must command a cordial support.  Courses of lectures and<lb/> classes have been&#44; or soon will be&#44; established in at least six<lb/> suitable locations within the city&#44; as also at Roxborough&#44; Frank&#45;<lb/>ford and other outlying points&#44; and the efficiency of the work<lb/> done at these local centres&#44; or at others still to be selected&#44; will<lb/> largely depend on the strength and enthusiasm of the Society&#39;s<lb/> membership.  The annual fee has been fixed at &#36;5.00 in the<lb/> hope that all interested in the work will lend their aid.  Mem&#45;<lb/>bers of the Society are privileged to attend any of its courses<lb/> free of charge.<lb/></p>
            <p>The report of the Secretary&#44; who has been abroad all Sum&#45;<lb/>mer&#44; studying the movement in England&#44; which contains a<lb/> detailed account of the University Extension work in that<lb/> country&#44; is ready for distribution and will be sent post free upon<lb/> application.<lb/></p>
            <p>Prof. Skidmore&#39;s article from the August number of<lb/> Lippincott&#39;s Magazine&#44; upon University Extension&#44; has been<lb/> reprinted and will also be sent.  For further information address<lb/> the Secretary.<lb/></p>
