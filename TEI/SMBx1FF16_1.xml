            <p>Richmond Jan 12 1859.<lb/>
                My Dear Mr Morais<lb/></p>
            <p>As I intended leaving<lb/> here on Sunday last&#44; you doubtless<lb/> thought a letter would not reach<lb/> me but the wet weather and the<lb/> fact of dear Sammie having the<lb/> Whooping Cough has necessarily detained me<lb/> and as missives from my friends are<lb/> so very welcome I do not like to be<lb/> deprived of them&#44; until we can commu&#45;<lb/>nicate personally&#44; for to use your own<lb/> expressions&#44; This life is composed of sep&#45;<lb/>arations and reunions&#44; and at this<lb/> moment I long to see my Philadelphia<lb/> friends.  The Hebrew young mens Literary<lb/> Association have reorganized the Rev<lb/> Mr Jacobs delivered a splendid address<lb/> on the occasion&#44; On the &#91;&#63;&#93;ation of<lb/> the ancients&#44; The subject for debate on<lb/> that day was&#44; which has the widest<lb/> field for eloquence the Pulpit or the Bar<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>my nephew was in favor of the Pulpit<lb/> <del>and</del> spoke well on the subject&#44; and made<lb/> some very beautiful and touching remarks<lb/> which drew forth considerable applause<lb/> and seemed to give general satisfaction.<lb/></p>
            <p>I regret<del>ted</del> much<lb/> that in my last I forgot to tell you of<lb/> a remedy for Claras frosted feet it is<lb/> Oil Spike&#44; my Jacob used it whilst<lb/> at boarding school&#44; and recommended<lb/> it to many of the students&#44; who were all<lb/> benefitted<sic></sic> by the application&#44; you need<lb/> only rub the parts affected&#44; every night<lb/> on going to bed.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am happy to state that<lb/> since my last <del>writing</del> to you I have received<lb/> several letters from Mr Hyneman<lb/> differing much from his former ones.<lb/>  Perhaps my kind friend I am indebted<lb/> to you for the change&#44; without your<lb/> having committed me&#44; I admit my<lb/> folly in having exposed my husbands<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="3"/>
            <p>strange notions&#44; but you will be confidented<sic></sic><lb/> Yours and Mr Hynemans letters were<lb/> received simultaneously the latter amazed<lb/> me so much that I really do not know<lb/> the contents of my last to you&#44; for whilst<lb/> I was writing company came in&#44; and<lb/> in order to send by that mail I was<lb/> obliged to close without reading what<lb/> I had written.<lb/></p>
            <p>You will perhaps have seen<lb/> Levy before receiving this&#44; as he left this<lb/> morning.  Mr Hyneman has a situation<lb/> for him&#44; but Levy objects&#44; because the man <del>he</del> is a<lb/> German&#44; please advise him as you<lb/> think best.<lb/></p>
            <p>Sammie is as well as can be<lb/> expected&#44; and the doctor thinks there<lb/> will be no risk <sic>travelling</sic> in clear<lb/> weather&#44; it is therefore very probable<lb/> that I will be home by the 25th Inst<lb/> I hope however to hear from you before that<lb/> time.  Please remember me affectionately<lb/></p> 
                
                <pb n="4"/>
            <p>to the families of Mrs Finsi Lobo Weil and<lb/> all enquiring friends.  My love to Clara<lb/> kiss both her and Nina for me I often<lb/> fancy I see the latter toddling around<lb/> the chairs &#38;c in her efforts to walk alone<lb/> my relatives and families all desire<lb/> kind regards to you and family.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am as ever<lb/>
                Yours very truly<lb/>
                Adeline Hyneman<lb/></p>
                
            <p>PS Mrs Jacob&#39;s presented the Rev with<lb/> his third daughter a few days since<lb/> I am sure you will explain.  How<lb/> unfortunate to have so many daughters<lb/> A H<lb/></p>
