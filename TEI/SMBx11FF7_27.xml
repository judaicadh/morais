            <p>A funeral address<lb/></p>
            <p>August 26&#44; 1892<lb/></p>
            <p>&#34;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord&#63;  And who shall stand<lb/> in His holy place&#63;  He that has clean hands and a pure heart&#34;<lb/>  Clean hands he had&#44; unpolluted by the holding of ill gotten lucre.  A<lb/> pure heart he possessed&#44; unsullied by wicked envy.  For years I had<lb/> observed D. H&#39;s ways&#44; as a child of the covenant and a social being&#44; and<lb/> I did approve.  Not in every instance had he conformed to the pre&#45;<lb/>&#45;scribed rules of the faith&#44; but his nature was intensely religious.  I<lb/> bear a moral conviction that sins of omission&#44; occasioned by circumstances<lb/> and surroundings&#44; were sorrowed for by my brother.  But while he<lb/> regretted shortcomings&#44; earnest he was in fulfilling duty.  How eager<lb/> in his wish to serve the Jewish cause&#33;  His knowledge of its high<lb/> claims on our time and efforts&#44; he illustrated beautifully&#44; as he<lb/> sat at a teacher&#39;s desk facing young pupils&#59; as he directed a school<lb/> during a stage of its history&#44; when none other could gratuitously as&#45;<lb/>&#45;sume the task of superintending it&#44; and as he intelligently con&#45;<lb/>&#45;ceived and overlooked the formation of classes to foster the<lb/> culture of our national literature.  And in all good doings&#44; so<lb/> perfectly free from any show of self importance&#44; so useful and so<lb/> gentle he was&#33;  Watching such proceedings I felt<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>thankful.  The greater I deemed my indebtedness to D H&#44;<lb/> as a coworker of mine in a common field of utility&#44; because I con&#45;<lb/>&#45;trasted his demeanour with that of some of his coevals&#44; who&#44;<lb/> born in our fold&#44; soon grow strangers to it&#45;&#45;heedless of its<lb/> demands on our joint endeavours.  My friend&#39;s<lb/> daily pursuits necessitated his frequent absence from home&#44;<lb/> but when abroad he still mingled among his fellow believers&#44;<lb/> inquired into their communal state&#44; sought their temporal<lb/> welfare and evinced a lively interest in whatever promoted<lb/> their religious progress.  I recall his return to our<lb/> midst after a sojourn in the West&#44; designed at the outset<lb/> as a permanent residence&#44; and I shall not easily forget the<lb/> narrative of his impressions during his stay in a city beyond<lb/> the Alleghenies.  In his discourse the speaker dis&#45;<lb/>&#45;closed a mind&#44; imbued with sentiments of unswerving<lb/> devotion to the ancestral creed&#44; and of abhorrence to a <sic>wil&#45;<lb/>&#45;ful</sic> desertion to the ancestral of its leading tenets.<lb/></p>
            <p>In a death so premature as that of our D H&#44; the Jewish<lb/> community has sustained a decided loss&#44; Philadelphia<lb/> became bereft of a man of unblemished character.  Would<lb/> that it were in my power to relieve the keen grief which<lb/> a lasting separation on earth has caused both relatives and friends.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>Considering myself among the latter&#44; I can only unite<lb/> with the very many who now lament an untimely de&#45;<lb/>&#45;parture&#44; hurtful to congregational&#44; charitable and<lb/> scholastic institutions....I am instinctively drawn<lb/> towards all who labor to uphold principles which<lb/> prophets and Sages honored and declared obligatory.<lb/>  The dear deceased revered ancestral doctrines.  Never<lb/> was he guilty of that levity which the thoughtless<lb/> sadly mistake for liberality.  He always referred<lb/> to Judaism and its behests in terms of profound respect&#44;<lb/> therefore I took unfeigned pleasure in him&#44; and therefore I sin&#45;<lb/>&#45;cerely deplore the void which pitiless death has created.<lb/>  But it ill becomes a servant of Israel&#39;s God to utter<lb/> complaints&#44; when a melancholy event calls for conso&#45;<lb/>&#45;lation.  What&#44; if I a finite and powerless being&#44; cannot offer<lb/> it&#63;  Listen&#44; O bereaved ones&#44; listen to the Royal psalm&#45;<lb/>&#45;ist.  He has tendered the afflicted the needed comfort&#58;<lb/> &#34;Who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord&#44; and who shall<lb/> stand in His holy place&#63;  He that has clean hands<lb/> and a pure heart&#44; who does not lift up his soul to<lb/> vanity&#44; nor swear deceitfully.  He shall receive a blessing<lb/> from the Lord&#44; and benevolence from the God of his salvation&#34;.<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>The upright Jew&#44; the loyal citizen&#44; the dutiful<lb/> son&#44; the loving brother&#44; the trusty friend will be missed<lb/> here below&#44; but up in the Tabernacle of the Lord&#44; in<lb/> the contemplation of the essence of his heavenly Maker&#44;<lb/> in the companionship of imparadised spirits&#44; in<lb/> the remembrance of his good deeds&#44; D H&#44; the virtuous<lb/> will live blissfully to all eternity.<lb/></p>
            <p>May it be so&#44; O God of infinite mercy.  Grant<lb/> that any failure in duty may have been atoned for by years<lb/>&#45;&#45;alas too short&#45;&#45;yet full of praiseworthy activity.<lb/>  Let the everlasting doors be opened&#44; that Thy servant<lb/> and <sic>worshipper</sic> D H. be admitted into the association<lb/> of the angelic host who declares Thee thrice Holy.<lb/>  On Thy paternal goodness he leaned for support here<lb/> and hoped to obtain it hereafter.  For Thou art the<lb/> God of the living and of the dead&#44; our only Saviour&#44; whose<lb/> name we bless from the cradle unto the hour of death.<lb/>  Amen.<lb/></p>
