            <p>Philadelphia&#44; February 26&#44; 1893.<lb/></p>
            <p>Honorable Joseph Blumenthal&#44;<lb/>
                My dear Sir&#58;<lb/></p>
            <p>I have just returned from a funeral and found a<lb/> telegraphic <sic>despatch</sic>&#44; stating that the New York committee&#44; expected here<lb/> this afternoon&#44; will not come.  I regret it very much&#44; because on Friday<lb/> morning&#44; I called on Dr. Cohen and made arrangements to invite Dr.<lb/> Steinbach&#44; the treasurer of our Phila Branch&#44; to meet us and talk matters<lb/> over&#44; previous to our annual meeting.  I have induced Mr. E. L. Rotschild&#44;<lb/> one of our Trustees&#44; to accept the presidency&#44; and Mr. Lederer&#44; who&#44; un&#45;<lb/>fortunately has just buried his father&#44; will as soon as he can.  Issue<lb/> calls for said meeting.  <del>I have induced Mr. E. L. Rothschild&#44; one of our<lb/> Trustees&#44; to accept the presidency&#44; and Mr. Leder</del> Mr. Hoffman&#44; who de&#45;<lb/>clined the presidency and for valid reasons preferred Mr. Rothschild&#44; will<lb/> gladly serve on the Board.  Naturally&#44; I feel greatly disappointed at the<lb/> unfavorable reports concerning the tuition in the Seminary.  It surprises<lb/> and pains me to hear that after the solemn promises given me by Dr.<lb/> Lieberman&#44; he continues to be irregular and justly occasions the displeas&#45;<lb/>ure of the Trustees&#44; and the imperative necessity of a change&#44; after his<lb/> having begged that I would allow him to remain till the end of the term.<lb/>  I might write and caution him once more&#44; but from what Mr. Max Cohen says&#44;<lb/> my endeavours in that direction would be futile.  AS to Dr. Jaffe&#44; I wish<lb/> to remind you of the ideas entertained by some of our students.  I notice<lb/> that Dr. Kohut has sent certificates as to character and abilities of the<lb/> aforenamed&#44; and  I was shown also a letter written by the Dr. to Dr. Cohen<lb/> on the merits of the aspirant to the Talmudical chair.  In that same letter&#44;<lb/> the Dr. intimates that the gentleman now at Oxford would be selected as<lb/> professor of exegises.  Clearly&#44; Dr. R. desires a thorough transformation<lb/> in the complexion of the Institution.  For that I am not prepared.  You know<lb/> my views about foreign scholars&#44; and the little importance I attach to big<lb/> names and highly complimentary documents.  It is this fondness for eclat&#44;<lb/> that has&#44; in my opinion&#44; sacrificed a thorough knowledge of Bible<lb/> and the spirit of prophetism to less essential studies.<lb/></p>
            <p>Admit&#58; We need a most suitable person to<lb/> watch over the instruction of pupils&#44; over their conduct&#44; habits&#44;<lb/> etc.&#44; and&#44; in all sincerity&#44; I would rejoice if I could be re&#45;<lb/>placed by a New Yorker&#44; able and willing to do us justice.  But<lb/> I know of none.  Our ministers are&#44; like myself here&#44; busy men&#44;<lb/> while some of them are wedded to a school which I learn&#44; every<lb/> day more&#44; to distrust.  While I remain connected with the seat<lb/> of learning&#44; gotten up in good faith for the perpetuation of<lb/> traditional Judaism&#44; I must prevent what will falsify its prom&#45;<lb/>ises and stultify my whole life.  With regret I say&#44; that this<lb/> week I am unable to be in New York.  Tomorrow I shall have<lb/> another funeral.  On Tuesday I am bound to teach children whom<lb/> I train to chant the prayers in Synagogue.  On Wednesday is the<lb/> fast of Esther and on Thursday&#44; Purim.  Meanwhile&#44; <sic>O</sic> hope you<lb/> will do me the favor to see Dr. Leiberman&#44; and tell him how an&#45;<lb/>noyed I am at his failing to keep up his promises.  If we must<lb/></p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
            <p>reduce the hours devoted to Talmudical studies&#44; let them be filled<lb/> up by the pupils&#44; either under Dr. Drachman&#44; or Mr. Speaker&#44; or<lb/> even by themselves&#44; having been assigned a certain task in Bible&#44;<lb/> history and Hebrew composition.  I hope to be able dearly next week<lb/> to see you and arrive at some definite conclusion.<lb/></p>
            <p>I am sorry to report that Isaac Husick was taken quite ill&#44;<lb/> and he is now laid up.  The doctors tell me that he has overtaxed<lb/> his strength by attending too closely to his studies.  But I fear<lb/> that the poor manner of living may have greatly contributed to<lb/> impair his health.  I trust that he will soon recover&#44; for he will<lb/> do us credit.<lb/></p>
            <p>With kind regards and wishing yourself&#44; and all connected<lb/> with the Seminary&#44; a merry Purim&#44; I remain<lb/> Yours truly<lb/> S. Morais.<lb/></p>
