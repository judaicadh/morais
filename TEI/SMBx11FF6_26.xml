            <p>S. MORAIS&#44;<lb/>
                546 N. Fifth St.<lb/></p>
            <p>Philadelphia&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>For a funeral<lb/></p>
            
            <p>The fragment of the Scriptures which I have just re&#45;<lb/>&#45;cited&#44; is so suggestive&#44; that it supplies reflective<lb/> minds with thoughts both instructive and consolatory.<lb/>  What necessity can there be after that for oratorical words of con&#45;<lb/>&#45;dolence&#44; or pastoral exhortations lamentations&#63;  what need of such&#44;<lb/> when we have learned fro ma soul&#45;illumined psalmist&#44;<lb/> how compassionate is He who has made us of a twofold<lb/> nature&#63;  What Grant solace in the inspired teaching&#33;  Because we all are frail and infirm<lb/> of purpose&#44; therefore our occasional straying away<lb/> from right&#44; will not hide from us the face of the<lb/> Most High.  Not because in our struggle between<lb/> the flesh and the spirit&#44; what is ignoble will&#44; at<lb/> times&#44; assert its supremacy&#44; therefore the noble part<lb/> in us will must suffer perdition.  No&#58; comforting is<lb/> the promise &#91;Hebrew&#93; &#34;Not for ever<lb/> will &#40;our heavenly Father&#41; chide&#44; nor retain His anger always.&#34;<lb/>  Shall fallible man then judge&#63;  Shall finite man say&#58; &#34;This<lb/> one was rich in opportunities to rise up to moral perfectibility&#44;<lb/> but since he preferred to be bound low down to the earth&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>therefore surely he will not enter the kingdom of the Ruler<lb/> enthroned in absolute perfection.&#34;  Or&#44; &#34;that one who followed the<lb/> way fif piety&#44; will surely certainly meet a welcome at the mansion<lb/> of the Parent of good.&#34;  No&#44; presumptuous is he<lb/> finite being who passes sentence on the future ultimate destiny of his<lb/> fellow&#45;being.  Guided by the wise teaching maxim of the<lb/> gentle hearted Hillel&#44; we should not trust our own selves&#44;<lb/> nor believe in our own powers of resistance&#44; till the hour of our<lb/> departure arrives&#44; for who can foretell&#44; asks the Sage&#44; &#34;who can<lb/> foretell&#44; if situated as our neighbor where we condemn&#44;<lb/> we would have acted differently&#34;; who can search<lb/> within us our inmost parts and discover whether the religious habits which<lb/> we praise are the effect of a deep set love of the com&#45;<lb/>&#45;mandments&#44; or rather of the long acquired outward custom&#63;  Silence<lb/> in the presence of death is therefore wisdom.  Silence touching those<lb/> whose mortal place remains vacant&#44; but much may<lb/> be spoken to those still clothed in mortality.<lb/></p>
            <p>Referring once again to the position of the psalm&#44; which<lb/> I have read&#44; I must point out to the living the<lb/> declaration of its inspired author.  &#34;The mercy of the<lb/> Lord and His loving&#45;kindness are felt by the children&#44; yea&#44;<lb/> by the children&#39;s children of such as keep His covenant&#44;<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>and remember His statutes to do them.&#34;  How can those<lb/> workings of celestial attributes be felt&#63;  By means of<lb/> parental education.  B...B.....is not dead.<lb/>  He lives in his child.  By Through that boy righteously reared&#44; will he remain<lb/> upon earth disembodied.  The Spiritual qualities which were<lb/> spiritual in the nature of the father&#44; ought to be reproduced in the<lb/> character of the representative of his name.  That<lb/> difficult&#44; but most sacred duty&#44; the duty of eliciting what is<lb/> good in the little one&#44; devolves upon the mother.<lb/>  Centering her powers on the attaining of that object&#44;<lb/> she will be in constant ethereal correspondence of sentiments<lb/> with the Israelite to whom she was wedded&#44; and<lb/> thus enhance his joys in eternity.  The relatives<lb/> of the deceased Israelite Hebrew&#44; will not consider if officious&#44;<lb/> to be asked to help the widow in her task.<lb/>  That some of them I know with whom I am acquainted&#44; are capable of aiding<lb/> in that holy undertaking&#44; I am assured by personal<lb/> observation.  May they apply educational knowledge<lb/> so blissfully.<lb/></p>
            <p>And Thou&#44; O God&#33; pour the balm of consolation on<lb/> the aged father&#44; too often tried in the crucible of<lb/> afflictions.  May past sorrows be forgotten<lb/></p>
            
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>in the joys yet in store for him and his progeny.<lb/>  Grant Thy creature B....B....forgiveness&#44; and<lb/> his relict the power to serve Thee by leading her child&#39;s<lb/> steps in the path of righteousness rectitude.  May example<lb/> allied to precept bring forth an abundance of noble<lb/> deeds&#44; <sic>benefitting</sic> society&#44; Judaism and the cause<lb/> of truth.  Grant that in every one who mourns be<lb/> fulfilled the sentence of the book of books &#34;Surely there<lb/> is a future&#44; and they hope will not be cut off.&#34;  Amen.<lb/></p>
